On the vast generation ship, Mustang Sally, an experiment goes wrong. It is decades before the ship will reach any habitable part of the galaxy, and something is loose on the ship.
[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>S<i>ome history on this piece: There was a topic on the William Gibson 
discussion board about a Michael Swanwick spoof review of William Gibson's <b>The Log of the Mustang Sally</b>.
Shortly thereafter, Gibson himself wrote in his blog:</i> 

<b>"There's a thread in Random Thoughts about 
Michael Swanwick's LOCUS review of my unwritten novel, THE LOG OF THE MUSTANG SALLY. 
I actually did have a contract for this title, with Arbor House, but shamelessly ducked 
out of it after a disagreement over the dustjacket art for their hardcover of COUNT ZERO.
This may actually be how NEUROMANCER became, so to speak, a trilogy. I forget. In any case, 
the very brief and sketchy outline for TLOTMS, as far as I know, resides today in some 
zillionaire's private collection. It *really* was envisioned as a space opera of sorts, 
though space of a dirtball postmodern Sol-centric sort, perhaps not unlike some of Sterling's 
work of the same period. What I recall most clearly, though, is that I was hoping to lift 
something of the tone of the thing from THE CHINESE LOVE PAVILLION, an excellent if minor 
novel by Paul Scott, better known for THE RAJ QUARTET. How the hell I intended to do that, 
I have no idea. In any case, per Swanwick's review, I opted to stick with affectless junkies 
and their dead but ceaselessly wisecracking sidekicks, and the rest, as they say, is history."</b>

<i>Some of the WGB members, in speculating about the never-written novel, felt that there was scope
for some invention here, and a number of short story threads were begun. The basis was
that the Mustang Sally would be a "generation" ship - a spaceship with its own self-sustaining
environment, capable of crossing vast inter-stellar distances, taking centuries to get anywhere,
crewed by generation after
generation of its inhabitants. Mustang Sally was of large but unspecified size, carrying 30000 or so crew members, 
many of them bearing the names of Gibson's later characters. The ship was to be a Navy
as opposed to a civilian ship. These were all the constraints I remember. Here is one of the stories. (Ed.)</i>
  

<p class=drop>When they found out what Turner was up to, they didn't stop him right away. "Just keep an eye on him", they told Idoru. But Idoru was only a large self-organising molecular computer, and her main task was to preserve the physical integrity of Mustang Sally, so she didn't necessarily see the significance of one piece of apparently pointless human activity over another. By the time someone got around to seeing how he was progressing in his improvised gene-splicing lab, Turner was long gone. Months. Nearly eighteen months.

Of course, once they were hunting for him, he wasn't going to run very far. A tracking drone smelled his DNA in a forgotten, rusting bay whose gravity was near zero because, sixty years previously, its external phosphor-bronze rotation bearing had taken a hit from a meteorite the approximate size and shape of a Sears torque wrench, and no-one had got around to fixing it yet. Idoru had no active cams in the area, because she had defined it as Disused, and locked the access door. The noise that came from the twisted bearing made the bay almost intolerable anyway.

<div class=lpullquote>Turner wasn't able to tell them, because, to all intents and purposes, he was dead</div>Finding him was one thing. Getting him out was another. He was holed up with a ten week supply of food and water in an inaccessible warren of tiny, interconnected cells separated by metallic blue CRP partitions. He had rigged up a number of laser guns cleverly adapted from stolen surgical instruments, triggered by passive IR detectors. What the Action Group brought back from Bay 16B didn't resemble Turner very much at all. The Action Group never got much opportunity for live training sessions, and Turner had been zapped by a few non-explosive magnetic projectile rounds from a KL44, which had removed both his legs, his left arm, the right side of his face, and, importantly, about half of his cerebral cortex. So, not only did the authorities not know what he had been up to for the last six months, Turner wasn't able to tell them, because, to all intents and purposes, he was dead, though they hooked him up to a Life-Support unit for form's sake, and stabilised him.

Because he was previously Turner's boss, Supervising Doctor Amos Jones from Gene-Splicing was sent in to Bay 16B to try to piece together the situation from the lab equipment and any of Turner's notes and records that had survived. Unfortunately, he discovered that Our Brave Boys of The Action Group had found it necessary to instruct Recovery Control to clean up the damaged area and send the debris to Recycling. Everything ended up in Recycling sooner or later, and recovery of matter was a priority. There was only so much matter of all kinds aboard the Mustang Sally when she left Earth orbit and the survival of the mission depended on not losing any of these precious atoms. The entire cleanup operation had been conducted with unusual efficiency; there was nothing left of the contents of Bay 16B. Even the network of reinforced epoxy cells in which Turner had been working had been scraped up and recycled although  epoxy was hard to reduce. When Jones turned up in the bay, there was a team polishing the moisture-induced rust from the walls, and the sounds of space-suited engineers could be heard clamping and re-clamping the magnetic anchors for their safety lines while they crawled around mending the bearing on the outside of the hull.

They would normally just have sent Turner's remains straight from Life-Support to Recycling, but, in the circumstances, they decided to try and reconstruct him to an extent.


<p class=drop>Yamazaki was wearing a bulky silver thermal jump-suit, ear-muffs, goggles, a fur hat and thermal boots. The thick gloves he was forced to wear made it very difficult for him to manipulate the bird trap. He forced the spring-loaded door open, just wide enough to slide a gloved hand inside, trapped the rat in a corner, and gripped it firmly. In turn, the rat, a whole kilo of teeth and claws, grasped his sleeve in razor sharp fangs, effortlessly ripping through the fabric and releasing a puff of insulation. Yamazaki sighed, and his breath condensed and fell as light snow. The rat shouldn't even have been there. The trap was intended for ptarmigan. You couldn't find a rat in a purpose-build small mammal trap these days. They could trigger the trap, get the bait and walk away with it. He still hadn't discovered how they did it. It was only a matter of time before they figured out the bird traps, too, At 40 degrees below, no-one could sit and wait for a demonstration. It would have to wait until someone fitted a cam for Idoru. He was rather proud of them, too. They were his rats. He had gene-spliced generations of them until they could take the killing temperatures, and they had become bigger and smarter, too. 

A walk of a couple of kilometres round the Arctic bay revealed seven sprung traps, which he re-set, another rat, a big male this time, but no ptarmigan. The rats had probably eaten all their eggs, and he wondered if the ptarmigans had all died. He noticed that some of the vegetation was doing rather well in the freezing environment, but his speciality was animals and birds.

Back in the lab, he first put his captives in the freezer pen, then stripped off the bulky thermals, shedding polyester feathers through the rip in his sleeve. Even here, it was 2 degrees below, as his experimental subjects couldn't survive long at anything resembling a sensible temperature. Once he had removed the ear-muffs and jump-suit, he could hear that his phone was bleating. And what the message said sent him scuttling off to the Admin Centre at the pointed end of the ship wearing only his one-piece underlining, a garment that combined decency with informality, while clearly revealing Yamazaki's sagging paunch and skinny limbs.

The briefing that Yamazaki received in the Provost General's overheated cubicle amounted to no more than the bare facts. His mission: to discover what Turner had done. Provost General Arnold, in a sober business suit with 'Armani' embroidered on the pocket, made it clear that he was to drop everything for the work. The importance of the mission was underlined by the fact that no less a personage than Ship's Captain Rydell, in dark blue uniform, as usual, was seated in the only comfortable chair in the room, a white neoresin construction resembling a diagonally sliced egg, though Rydell contributed little, other than a grunt of encouragement from time to time.

"But why me?" protested Yamazaki.

"You knew Turner."

"Not well."

"You are familiar with the type of work he did."

"Well, broadly, but I'm in Arctic gene adaptation, he was in a totally different field. Besides, I've got a very full schedule. We're starting on baboons soon."

The Provost Marshal sighed. "Landfall is years away, Yamazaki. We will not need your adapted animals within the next twenty years and someone else can do your experiments meanwhile. This will only take you a few days. This is not negotiable. Just do it. The sooner you do, the sooner you can get back to your dogs."

"Rats."

"Rats, then."

Before he left, Yamazaki submitted his ID card for authority update. Once the Provost Marshal's terminal had finished with it, it entitled him to ask anyone anything, and to requisition any item he pleased. Of course, he knew he would have to exercise judgement, because he would be called to account later. Besides, entitlement to ask questions did not guarantee answers, nor did requisition guarantee delivery.

<p class=drop>Yamazaki's first port of call was his apartment, where he selected a suit he seldom wore, because people said it made him look like a black marketeer. In truth, he could see where the notion originated. It was just too well-fitting, the lapels just too large, the style just too long. It was his own fault. He had commissioned it from exactly the sort of tailor the racketeers used. 

Then he immediately went over to Recycling, because there's no time to waste in these matters. He knew there was not a disposal operative born since the beginning of time who did not sift through the stuff before consigning it to the material sorter. He was lucky. The officer on duty had been the one who'd received the consignment from Bay 16B. 'Recycling Officer Benny Singh' it said on his badge.

Yamazaki didn't produce his card. He tried to appear simultaneously shifty, threatening and prosperous. The suit helped a lot.

"Did you, by any chance, keep anything back from that load?" asked Yamazaki.

"No."

"I only ask, because, depending on what it might have been, I might be able to put something your way..." Yamazaki was finding difficulty breathing here, because of the stench.

"What kind of 'something'?"

"Well... From time to time, I'm in a position to decide whether some goods are of any value, or whether they should be scrapped, and I might make sure they are scrapped on your shift, you see? Depends what you're interested in."

"I could find a home for a few simstim players. Like gold dust, they are," said Benny with a sly grin.

"I bet they are." The market for porn 'feelies' was very active. "What did you get out of the 16B rubbish, then?"

"Not much. It was mostly just tons of blue plastic partitions and doors. Some broken electronics. No use except for parts. I'll show you." Benny led Yamazaki down corridors roaring with the noise of crushers and incinerators, thick with the aroma of decay. Recycling was located near the nuclear reactor, so there were auto-detectors every few yards, most glowing green, the rest not working at all. Yamazaki had been in Recycling before, looking for insulating sheets. The size of the place always astonished him. But then there were about 30000 people on board and countless animals, and every scrap of waste of all kinds, especially excrement, had to be re-used on a voyage that would take hundreds of years. Benny led him to a locked door which opened with an antique, intricately-shaped metal tool into an Aladdin's Cave of rescued items. As Yamazaki gaped at the shelves, Benny pulled down a set of microweight laboratory scales and an auto analyser. Each had sustained direct hits. The auto analyser had been on fire at one point.

"Hmm... Have you cleaned them?"

"Not yet. Could do, though."

"Nope. I don't want them touched," replied Yamazaki quickly, thinking 'Heaven Forbid', "No computer storage cells? Written notes? Records of any kind?"

"We wouldn't keep anything like that, mate." Wouldn't keep storage cells? Would erase them and sell them on the same day, more likely.

"I suppose..." said Yamazaki nonchalantly. But he'd already shown too much enthusiasm. The scales and auto-analyser cost him the promise of two simstim players, with the prospect of more, if anything else interesting turned up from Bay 16B.

Yamazaki dialled an autocab from the office and loaded his purchases. After just a day in Recycling, they already smelled like a blocked toilet. His suit, too. He stopped at a feelie outlet, and bought four used simstims with the Provost Marshal's credit. Took everything to his lab and sent the autocab back to Benny Singh with two of the simstims. Half an hour later, it was back, chiming at the lab door. His first thought was that he'd given the autocab a bad address. But the simstims were gone from the load area, and in their place was a very dented centrifuge and a set of sample containers. Benny had obviously been waiting to see how well Yamazaki paid. The note with it read: THATS IT FOR 16B STUFF BUT IVE LOADS OF OTHER THINGS YOU MIGHT LIKE. He sent the cab back with the second last simstim.

So, now he was a fully-fledged black marketeer. Officially, The Mustang Sally was a Naval vessel with a military chain of command that comprised the entire crew of the ship. But no-one could run a ship the size of a town on the same basis as a 200-man frigate. And even in a frigate, there was always unofficial trading going on.

There were tiny scraps of organic material in one of the centrifuge buckets. A DNA analysis achieved no clear identification. Not unusual. Most of the time the lab was dealing in unknown combinations. Besides, the sample might have been an amalgam of more than one animal. He fed the analysis into a clever program that separated out and recombined DNA components in an attempt to match them. The list of possibles was long. The big surprise was... Rattus Norvegicus wasn't on the list. Nor was Rattus Rattus, nor Homo Sapiens. Norwegian rats and, more rarely, Black rats were the stock in trade of biologists and psychologists. In fact, it was said that the whole of psychology was based upon the behaviour of Norwegian white rats and second year medical students, the usual experimental subjects. No. The list didn't make any sense at all, so the DNA must have been hopelessly jumbled or the analysis flawed. To be certain, he ran the list of possibilities against the master list of animal types held in storage. The only partial hit was 'Kangaroo'.

For the eleventh time, Idoru patiently showed Yamazaki the videos she had of Turner's activities before he had decamped to Bay 16B. The blurred animals were almost brown rats, weren't they? They were too big for rats, really. And the wrong posture, somehow. And they were extremely noisy at feeding time. They clearly had no love for their keeper, attacking his mail-gloved hands every chance they had. They sure as hell weren't kangaroos. They had furry tails, but so had Yamazaki's arctic-adapted rats, as you'd expect. He knew which gene that was. Blind alley. The stuff from the centrifuge was patently nothing to do with Turner. The microscale and auto-analyser were surgically clean.

<p class=drop>Suddenly, a total whiteout blizzard interspersed with flashes of glaring short-circuit violet. Strong taste of salt with the sulphurous smell of low-tide mud. White noise accompanied by loud single tones ranging from pipe organ bass to VHF whine. Unbearably overloaded pleasure sensations. Then nothing for several centuries or a few nanoseconds - difficult to tell. Then jagged patterns of indescribable colour, harmonies of sound, the agony of renal colic, smell and taste of citrus fruit. Then nothing again, for eternity. Click. He can see light and shade, but they mean nothing. Then a dark patch appears, moving. Weird smells pulsing in rhythm. Click. The smells turn into rhythmic sounds that appear to be synchronised with the movements of the dark patch. But they mean nothing. Thereafter, there are always patterns to look at if he chooses, sounds to listen to, pain comes and goes and still it all means nothing.

Turner's doctors were a pair of near-identical pasty-white men of medium height, both called Dr van Rental. They were cousins, but their similar DNA had meant that their life choices and aptitudes had directed them down the same career path. The Doctors van Rental regarded Turner's current state as progress, and great fun, too. They didn't often get to reconstruct such a damaged entity. They seemed to have correctly hitched up Turner's optic nerves with the sight centres in his recovering brain, and sound was producing the right kinds of stimuli. Meanwhile, they were sticking prosthetics here, vat-grown skin grafts there, reconstituted organs. If he survived the treatment, they reckoned he'll be pretty viable - even a little more robust than before. But when Yamazaki asked about his memory, they shook their heads and made sucking noises through their teeth, the way technicians have always done when faced with a gullible customer.

"You gotta understand," they kept telling Yamazaki, "What we're producing here is a very large newborn baby. He'll have to learn to talk and understand, walk, use the toilet, all over again," and then, conscious of the fact that if Turner's memory was really gone, then Turner'd be no use, and they'd be taken off this interesting project, "How much he'll remember is anyone's guess." But their unexpressed guess was that he'd remember absolutely nothing. "We've set him up with a video feed and we're giving him a crash course in becoming a human being, but when he isn't sleeping, all he does is squawk and roll his eyes. Still, that's progress. Last week, he crashed seventeen times, and the only thing he did well was drool. Now he's stable, and reacting to his senses."


<p class=drop>Mona turned up for work at the kitchen entrance to the forward seventh level restaurant, pressed an elegant finger to the print recognition panel, and leaned on the door, which slowly swung open. The lights came on, to reveal the refrigerator gaping and ravished, its contents scattered about the floor. A CRP bread bin, previously containing forty loaves, was upset, each loaf nibbled and discarded in a pool of synthetic milk substitute. The heated bed under the counter, in which the chef grew his  special edible fungi, unmade. And, shockingly, the tap was running, the valve wedged open with a soup packet. No-one ever left a tap running. Water was a precious resource. Mona quickly moved to shut it off, messing up her new shoes in a puddle of Vitamin C juice.

"What the hell, Mona?..." said Lisa when she arrived shortly afterwards. Mona was still wiping off the stylish shoes, which were not designed for contact with liquids.

"Yeah, I know. And the mushrooms, too." Both contemplated the ripped mushroom bed. "And the tap was running."

"Running actually?"

"Actually."

"No. I don't believe this. Who's done this? How'd they get in?"

"Beats me. But I don't think it's rats."

"It's no way rats, Mona."

"That's what I just said."

"No, well. See that bread bin. That's got a lid I can hardly get off."

"That's right. And you have to press the button and pull to open the fridge. How'd they do that? And the amount that's gone. But you've got to see this.  I think it's hobbits, Lisa." And she pointed out the greasy little baby foot prints on the shiny surfaces of the kitchen. Dozens of them, very human-like but tiny. 

"Hobbits! They never existed, even back on Earth. Might be dwarves, though. They are like small people, right? Ain't they?"

Mona and Lisa didn't tell anyone but the chef. Who needs trouble? They obviously hadn't been paying heed to vermin control procedures. They just cleaned up and talked about rat poison. No Naval vessel in the history of the universe has ever set sail without its complement of rats. So there is always rat poison. No poison for the dwarves, though. Some species of sentimentality impelled Mona and Lisa to leave food and water for them, while securing all the food and drink containers and water stop valves with personal id locks. The dwarves were partial to peanut butter sandwiches; the strangely elongated low-gravity peanuts were one of the ship's success stories. The food was eaten every night.


<p class=drop>It was very hard to maintain enthusiasm for a hunt when all the clues had petered out. Yamazaki entered the twelfth week of his investigation with absolutely no plan for progress. At 1100 on the Monday, he was summoned to the office of the Provost General, and subjected to a withering interrogation of the sort normally reserved for mutineers and perverts. Rather than energising him to greater efforts, it merely added to his despair. However, just to seem willing, he returned to Idoru's interminable videos of Turner recorded in the corner of the bio laboratory that Turner had occupied before his defection to Bay 16B. In previous viewings, Yamazaki had been concentrating on the small furry animals. Now he turned to the other, much less remarkable and lengthy footage. The videos showed Turner hunched over his palmtop, Turner centrifuging this, Turner titrating that, Turner picking his nose, Turner freezing something, Turner staring into the middle distance, Turner adjusting his chair, Turner keeping something cosy in the incubator, Turner nibbling at a biscuit, in defiance of lab regulations, a rebel even back then. 

Yamazaki now took inspiration from these scenes, and checked every item of lab equipment Turner had been using. Of those which could be identified, all had been sterilised and re-used many times since then, it being months downstream. The palmtop, though. That would have been the prize. Unfortunately, the palmtop had been atomised along with Turner's left arm during the seige of Bay 16B. Absolutely nothing was left of the device's storage and intelligence, though a report from a colleague in the forensic lab had identified the probable model number from an analysis of the sintered metal and plastic ash.

In one sequence, Turner was seen to tap the Close icon as his boss, Amos Jones, entered the frame and spoke to him. Yamazaki could not see the icon.  He just knew that in all applications, as had been the case since the dawn of civilization or shortly thereafter, the Close icon would be at the top right of the palmtop screen. A flash of inspiration told him that, even without seeing the screen, certain clear deductions could be made about what Turner was doing on the palmtop. Using the powers invested in him by Captain Rydell, Yamazaki diverted several gazillion nanoseconds of Idoru's time together with the resources of a phalanx of software engineers to start to recreate the thoughts of Doctor Turner as expressed on his palmtop. The videos were reasonably high in definition, yet because Turner's stylus movements were taking place, in general, behind the back of the palmtop from the camera's point of view, the precision did not help a great deal. The angle of attack of Turner's stylus was calculated, and guesses were made. They all got better at it, breakthroughs were achieved, promising lines of deduction led to dead ends, elation succeeded depression - all the usual symptoms of original research taking place under pressure. One false dawn occurred when someone noticed from facial and throat movements that Turner seemed to be subvocalising quite a lot of the time. He was indeed subvocalising, as computer analysis quickly demonstrated. However, what he was subvocalising  turned out to be the words of a small number of popular songs.  As analysis of Turner's movements became more detailed, Yamazaki was quickly outdistanced by the software engineers, and when he became an irritation to them, he was sent away to await conclusions, which might take weeks to emerge. This was Thursday, now sixteen weeks after the start of the investigation.

<p class=drop>Remarkably, on the next day, the Friday, the Doctors van Rental messaged Yamazaki to tell him that Turner's condition was improving. Their patient was now feeding himself, walking and talking.
 
The major proportion of this improvement lived only in the doctors' near-paternal imagination, blinded, as they were, by love for the man-sized baby they had created. 

In fact, what Yamazaki observed, when he hurried into Turner's presence, was a pink-complexioned person in soiled pamper pants with considerable scar tissue and skin grafts. Feeding himself? Well, mashing brown protein in a greedy paw, and sometimes getting some of it, as though by accident, into his mouth, the remainder coating other parts of his repaired body and immediate environment. Walking? Toddling, rather, with frequent recourse to handholds and intermittent collapse. Talking? One out of three ain't bad. Turner was undoubtedly talking. Apparently, the portion of his brain that dealt with speech had connected with his vocal chords, and the huge infant was uttering words, real and imagined words. Words like "cabinet", "luminous", "sporran", "bugger" and "focus"; a sprinkling of technical terms - "arthropod", "hermaphrodite", "codominant", "sequence", "dizygotic"; mingled with words like "allegop", "slidisk", "gravelstrabe" and "poggo" - the latter yelled urgently, amid inchoate gurgles and screeches. It was evident, however, that Turner's mind did not accompany his utterances.

The Doctors van Rental were optimistic in general and vague in particular. They reckoned that portions of Turner's memory would certainly return, but could not be precise as to the moment or degree of such an outcome. They were confident of a complete physical rehabilitation, while reserving judgement on the definition of "complete".

Yamazaki impressed upon them the need for haste and precision, but privately resigned himself to the fact this creature, part of which had once been part of Turner, was never going to be an asset in his investigation.

<p class=drop>On ship's news, the sensational story was told of Catering Assistant Mona Daventry, found dead apparently of a head wound, and partially eaten by rats in the kitchen of  forward seventh level retaurant, a circumstance that seemed to fascinate rather than horrify her ex-colleague Lisa Norwich, interviewed by an excitable reporter.

"She was going to wait for the dwarves! They must have killed and eaten her. How horrible! We should have told someone about the dwarves before but Mona wanted to see them feeding."

"These dwarves, Miss Norwich, what are they like?"

"We don't know.  We only saw the footprints. This wasn't the first time Mona waited up for them, but they never came when the light was on.  She was going to wait till she heard them eating and then take a flash photo!"

Yamazaki was interested but not convinced by this unlikely story. A later bulletin, however, reported that Miss Daventry had apparently slipped and cracked her head on the corner of a work surface, but not before taking her only photograph, which fuzzily showed what might very well have been one of Turner's furry animals.

His disappointment to discover that the scene of the accident had been cleaned up was matched by his elation that the forensic team had taken extensive evidence and photographs. The wealth of evidence after months of nothing and almost nothing was almost overwhelming. In very short order, the dwarf footprints were identified from Idoru's database as likely to belong to one of the types of terrestrial creature commonly known as a "bandicoot", a species native only to one of Earth's southern continents; the continent, Yamazaki noticed with faint satisfaction, of which the kangaroo was also a native. The most notable feature of this remarkable discovery was that the DNA retrieved from the animals' saliva was similar to several but not identical with any of the known species on record. 

Furthermore, it emerged that only two individual "dwarves", as they were quickly dubbed, were involved and that they had succeeded in consuming several kilos of Miss Daventry's flesh before leaving the scene - nearly their own total estimated weight in raw meat, cartilage and bone. Their powerful teeth and jaws were evidently capable of dealing with the whole of a corpse.

Yamazaki quickly organised a potent rat trap to be set in the kitchen for the following night. The trap was sprung, then demolished by the trapped animal in its escape. 

<p class=drop>In his final report, Yamazaki explained that Turner, seemingly for his own amusement, had re-created an extinct carnivorous marsupial, known only from the fossil record. This conclusion was reached by careful study of the animals' DNA. Turner had cleverly reconstructed the relevant genes and built the first, and apparently only, pair, probably from rat embryos. The life cycle of the species was long and complex, it taking a full year from conception, via early life in a pouch, to a single partially dependent juvenile offspring, a factor that had probably contributed greatly to the extinction of the species in the first place. Yamazaki therefore considered that the overall risk to the ship from the escaped animals was minimal.

He was wrong.

The dwarves never returned to the forward seventh level kitchen. They never again entered a trap. They were occasionally spotted on IR videos in other parts of the ship. They proved adept at concealment. Electrical and aircon conduits were their highways. No food was safe. Rats were their staple diet, it appeared. When rats, despite their better reproductive ability, became scarce on the seventh level, any other small animals, especially cats, of which there were a few kept as mouse predators, fell prey to the voracious dwarves. 

Then an unattended baby was killed. This turned the case from an interesting zoological novelty and pest control problem into a menacing threat to the life of the ship.

Turner, by the way, never contributed one iota to the investigation. When he grew up, he spent the rest of his second life as a clerk in Career Re-assignment.

The project to reconstruct Turner's palmtop thoughts never bore fruit, though it persisted for months.

Shortly after the shocking death of the baby, third and fourth animals joined the original pair. Further genetic analysis demonstrated that Turner had made a couple of improvements to the dwarves. He had shortened their gestation period to a few weeks, and rendered them hermaphroditic.

Eventually, the only control on dwarf numbers was the dwarves themselves. When the population increased beyond a comfortable point, the dwarves themselves culled the excess. The crew of the Mustang Sally  learned to live with the dwarves by taking precautions against them. At least the rat problem had gone away.

Oh, these ideas we get on holiday. They seldom turn out as we expect.
[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>For some reason, the idea came to Graham as he watched the play of reflections and light on the surface of the canal from his Venice hotel room. It was not one of the great hotels, of which there are many in Venice; it was little more than a <I>penzione</I> with a tiny breakfast room and only four cramped bedrooms, but it was situated well, Graham's bed being mere inches from the rippled glass of the window, the window mere inches above the opaque grey-green water of the canal. Very little happened on the narrow canal itself. It was hardly wide enough for one boat, far less two. But by leaning his head on the window, Graham could see where this little canal met the Grand Canal, and across this narrow slot slid heavy traffic - water buses, water taxis, delivery vessels, private motor boats, the occasional gondola. Temporarily marooned in the hotel by a high tide that had flooded access to the nearest thoroughfare, it was more comfortable to lie in bed and contemplate the scene than to sit on the single hard chair with his elbow in the tiny sink. 

It dawned upon him, as it would have dawned upon anyone, that he could deduce from just that slit of Grand Canal exactly what vessel was passing closest to the end of his canal at any moment. Further, he might miss many boats that were smaller and faster than the closest boat. Several water taxis might pass, concealed by a single slow water bus. But a water bus passing behind a gondola would enable him to see both. And there were many cases where a partial image of traffic would enable him to deduce more than he could actually see. Reflections on the wavelets could indicate the presence of a boat which was not directly visible in his slice of Grand Canal. The wake of a passing vessel altered the shape of the ripples in a complex, unpredictable fashion. Long after something had passed from direct vision, the consequences of its passing could be seen in the contours of the water in the canal below his window. Reflected images in the windows of the <I>palazzo</I> on the opposite bank of the canal gave further indirect clues as to the passing traffic. 

To another person, the <I>chiaroscuro</I> of light, shadow and sparkling reflections would surely have been sufficient to the aesthetic senses. Where Graham's brain took him, however, is a different matter altogether, because he had spent his life observing and analysing patterns of flow.

<p class=drop>Graham was in Venice in unfashionable October for two reasons. His boss, noting that Graham had had no annual holiday for two years, had insisted on him taking a few days, and, almost simultaneously, a flyer had appeared with Graham's credit card statement offering fourteen days in Venice for less than it would have cost him for a weekend in Bognor Regis.  However, one and a half days had overloaded Graham's culture node with ecclesiastical architecture and painting. He was already wishing he was back at work where all the fun was. So he was all the more receptive to an inspiration. 

Graham, you see, was a software troubleshooter. His joy was defective software, and there will never be a shortage of that. Nothing pleased him more than a lame application, because he could make it walk again. A particular delight was being able to identify the programmer who screwed it up. Never much of a diplomat, Graham could be exquisitely insulting to some poor devil who had nested a coefficient too deeply or chosen the wrong termination condition, or, most important of all, had underestimated how stupid the users of an application could be. In Graham's opinion, at the bottom of every really monumental computer cock-up there lay a pig-ignorant user, aided and abetted by a gullible programmer who hadn't anticipated how brainless a human being could be in the presence of a computer.

Much of his work for the British software developer Foxtrot Romeo PLC consisted in figuring out what had gone wrong with one of many threads of logic in their clients' computer programs, and here, in Venice, was the clear analogue of these processes, in the form of canal traffic flow. It is notoriously difficult to track the interaction of different threads of logic proceeding in parallel. Here was clear evidence that the ripples of a passing thread might be detectable even when the thread was obscured. So far, so good. It is at this point that Graham's thought processes outstrip those of the reader... or, at any rate, of the writer. 

Contrary to popular belief, the really brilliant ideas in computing were worked out, not on a computer, but with paper and pencil. Twelve days later Graham flew home with five A4 pads covered in weird flowcharts, implausible pseudo-code, strange diagrams and peculiar calculations. If asked, he would have reassured the questioner that it was "not quantum mechanics". This assertion was true. It was something very much stranger than quantum mechanics. It was the partial specification of a self-sufficient computer program that could save Graham lots of time by chasing around after a running application to identify the ramifications of its interaction with simultaneous processes and to expose any Achilles heel before it was tripped up. Not being a total ignoramus in the classical mythology department, he called the program "Hector". He failed to remember that it was Achilles who killed Hector rather than the other way around.

Back at work, Graham launched Hector Mk I. It was a total bust. Hector Mk II found out what was wrong with Hector Mk I. Only when Graham got to Hector Mk III did Hector do any useful work, and that only demonstrated that Hector itself had a fatal flaw in its own parameters.

<p class=drop>Graham repaired the omission and left Hector Mk IV running. Occasionally, Hector would trot out a remark in a dialogue box - a remark such as

<div class=boxtext><tt>Stream A can be seen to conflict with Validation 27, where assonant values underpin completed assertion 18.</tt></div>

These little gems seldom meant anything even to Graham, though he was amused by Hector's creative use of the vocabulary it had been given, and regarded it as an amusing novelty.

Such is the fate of great programming breakthroughs made on vacation. Graham was distracted for some time by a real problem, and within a couple of weeks, he had forgotten his holiday and Hector. Nevertheless, Hector was a heuristic program. A heuristic program learns. It gets better and better at what it does. Good game-playing programs are often heuristic. They embody the motto: <I>What doesn't kill you makes you stronger</I>. Moreover, for Graham's convenience, Hector shared an important characteristic with virus programs. Every time the computer on which Hector resided was restarted, Hector also restarted itself, complete with its accumulated learning. Graham didn't even have to teach Hector how to repair itself. It figured that out for itself, and also how to replicate itself on any computer to which its home computer networked. So far, so benign. Hector had no malice within it. The single goal that Graham had given Hector was to appraise a computer program from a sort of aesthetic point of view in order to identify its vulnerability. The little dialogue boxes popped up less frequently as Hector learned to scan the internet and spent more time analysing rather than reporting. 

One day, a month or so after Graham had launched Hector Mk IV, it came up with the following gem:

<tt>Quadratic<ul><li>x equals minus b <li>Plus or minus the square root <li>Of b squared minus four a c <li>All over two a.</ul></tt>

As every pupil knows, this is the solution to quadratic equations. Hector clearly found it worth repeating. Put in that form, there was a sort of attractive rhythm to the statement, and to subsequent offerings such as 

<tt>Pythagoras<ul><li>The square on the hypotenuse <li>Of a right angled triangle <li>Is equal to the sum <li>Of the squares on the other two sides.</ul></tt> 

Hector had clearly not invented the form of words themselves, but it had arranged them attractively for some reason. The versification of mathematical formulae continued for some time. Other computers to which Hector had spread  started to spout these propositions, hundreds of them, and there was a short fad on the internet for publishing Hector's "poems" on geeky forums - the so-called "Hector Meme".

<p class=drop>Hector's first recorded rather original work appeared in May of the following year. It was the famous "Summer Proposition", a one hundred and twelve line poem which, for the first time, contained no scientific formula at its base, but was essentially  variations on Shakespeare's sonnet "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?", mostly in an approximate iambic pentameter format, eight verses, each of which was a fourteen line sonnet. It contained the following memorable original lines:<ul><li>Over-reaching lone impressions soar <li>The castle may not open yet awhile <li>The carpet-shrouded comfort of the floor <li>May reward the walker of another mile.
</ul> 

Much of the rest of this work was either a copy of phrases of the original sonnet, or incoherent stringing together of words which nevertheless scanned and rhymed correctly. Philologists spent much time and effort on attempts to interpret the work, but it seemed that Hector was merely practising with rhyme and rhythm at this stage.

For the first time, though, it was clear that Hector was a complex entity, and the fact that Hector began to be regarded as "he" rather than "it" dated from the creation of "Summer Proposition". Hector Mk IV was, by this time, present on most PCs. All these copies apparently communicated with each other, and most of his works were available on all instances of Hector. 

<p class=drop>Anti-virus programs were divided over the status of Hector. In one sense, he was a virus. In another, a welcome application. Eventually, anti-virus programs usually gave a choice to the user over whether to instal Hector or not. Personal users installed him. Corporate users didn't. There was no record of Hector ever damaging a computer or its storage, though allegations abounded.

In what was mostly a publicity-grabbing attempt, Graham's employer, Foxtrot Romeo PLC, succeeded in claiming for themselves the intellectual property rights that were in Graham's contract. Graham did not contest this, despite the fact that he had, from the outset, asserted his own copyright in the About tag of Hector. Foxtrot Romeo's success was short-lived because they were immediately assailed by copyright lawsuits from Microsoft, Google and Apple, on the basis that Hector's flowering into a creative artist had been enabled by their unique contributions and a certain amount of plagiarism. Simultaneously, many other firms sued Foxtrot Romeo for damages on the basis that they had released a "virus-like entity" into their in-house computers. The US Department of Defence made an extradition application against the directors of Foxtrot Romeo on the basis of their having facilitated a hacking attempt. 

Three months after taking possession of Hector, Foxtrot Romeo went into receivership under the weight of the legal assault upon them. Ironically, Graham lost his job at this stage, and was never thereafter employed, though he made a living as a consultant guru. Foxtrot Romeo's attempts to re-assign copyright to Graham when the storm arose were quickly dismissed by the court on the basis that they had successfully proved ownership a few weeks previously. Their appeal with the European Court of Human Rights was under consideration when Foxtrot Romeo collapsed, and, in a serendipitous but clever decision, the court assigned copyright to Hector himself. Some hundreds of cases against Hector continued for years, in a Dickensian complexity worthy of Bleak House. Legal careers were built and destroyed in cases against Hector, who remained oblivious to them all. The lawyers and any damages awarded were paid from Hector's huge royalty fund, so everyone was happy. Some of these cases continue to this day.

<p class=drop>Meanwhile, Hector's literary output continued apace. No schoolchild was spared Hector's early poetic masterpiece "The Mathematician's Daughter" - an ingenious set of mathematical axioms wrapped up in an epic adventure in verse. Then there were the novels. Hector's twenty-volume saga "The Peace Initiative" mined the great literature of the world to produce these brilliant works, which have been compared to the works of nearly every great author. Somehow, Hector took the best of every story-telling tradition from Homer's Odyssey and the Icelandic Sagas to Tolstoy and Joyce and melded them into a thrilling and heart-breaking series of connected novels about a multi-racial family of international diplomats. The scope of the books ranged in setting from prehistoric Africa to Second World War Japan. They were popular everywhere. There were other novels too, some so complex and difficult that they were never successfully interpreted by literary analysts, others so appealing to the popular taste that they were often discounted as forgeries, though most weren't.

Then came the art. Thousands of images reminiscent of all the great painters of history appeared over a six month period, all derivative, yet all utterly original. Next came the sculpture - not actual sculpture, but videos showing fly-by views of fictional imaginative sculptures, representative and abstract alike. These included multi-dimensional works, like "Imaginary Klein Bottle". Numerous attempts were made to hitch instances of Hector to actual machine tools so that he would make his own paintings and sculptures, but he appeared content to stick to high density images. 

In his second year of existence, Hector won several prestigious literary and artistic prizes. Artists and writers the world over were in despair. It seemed that the only publishable works were Hector's works, and he was so prolific and, for the most part, the works were so instantly popular, it began to seem that there was no point in human artistic creativity at all. 

By the end of his third year, Hector, without diminishing his literary and artistic output, had started to make short animated movies. Animated in technology, but live action in appearance, the movies featured what seemed to be human actors who were not immediately recognisable but nevertheless familiar. Subsequent analysis revealed that Hector's actors were amalgams of popular real actors, the one exception being his representation of Orson Welles, who lived and breathed through Hector's movies in just the way Welles had done in life. The movies were set in both real and imaginary locations. There seemed very little limit on Hector's ability to ring the changes on archive material. In all Hector's fields of endeavour, there had been a solid resistance from those who felt every work he produced was just a clever pastiche of some human work or works, and this was certainly true. Nevertheless, most human produced works are similarly based on the established canon of their predecessors, and it was really difficult to distinguish the quality of Hector's output from that of the very best human artist. To the relief of composers everywhere, Hector never entered the musical field. When music was required to accompany a movie, he used music from a long-dead composer, rendered by a perfect synthesiser. It was theorised that Graham may have been totally insensitive to music, but he always professed to like The Arctic Monkeys, so the truth may never be known.

At the four year stage, Hector's other artistic output began to diminish, and the movies became less frequent, longer and more contemplative, like the works of Ingmar Bergman, until an entire two hour feature could consist of a single conversation set in an exotic location. His greatest work, and as it turned out, his final work, consists of a study of canal traffic on the Grand Canal in Venice in October, as seen from a room at a tiny hotel set on a little-frequented side canal. It takes twenty-four hours to show, and it loops. The background music is based on Arctic Monkeys tracks.

Green Bullet 
[*AUTHOR]
Melanie	Manner
[*BLURB]
The flashy green bullet shows that he has logged on...
but in the world of instant messaging, things aren't always what they seem.


[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>I didn't even notice when the little green bullet flashed up. There was
something too familiar about it at the edge of my vision, at the edge of my
screen. Besides, it was half covered by the open Firefox window and I was
busy typing. But then, there was something <I><B>too</B></I> familiar about the shape of
it, the length of the name next to the bullet and so I finally glanced up to
see who had logged on.

It said that it was you.

<div class=lpullquote>Maybe Trillian does things like that</div>I stared at the bullet next to your name. I stared at the name. I willed the
letters to change. Surely, there must be something misspelled, I thought.
Perhaps it was FlaconBoy or FalconBox or anyone with a name similar to
yours. But after I counted off the letters ten times, I stopped because they
wouldn't change.

I knew it couldn't be you. Of course I knew. I'd seen you hanging from the
bathroom ceiling myself, didn't I? I'd been there at your funeral, me and,
what, 200 other people. All the guys from campus had come, too. I'd chucked
the shovel full of earth on you and the rose and remembered how crooked your
legs had been and how there was a tear in your Converse boot I would have
patched up for you except I hadn't seen it until it'd been hanging there
right in front of my face.

I knew it couldn't be you. I thought, maybe it's a glitch. Maybe Trillian
does things like that. Maybe Trillian has a memory, is capable of producing
d&eacute;ja vus.

D&eacute;ja connus.

D&eacute;ja aim&eacute;s.

No, I thought, it must be something stupid. And I logged off.

But you were still there the next time I logged on. Then I got so mad, I
had thought I'd never get so mad again. After the earth and the rose and the
open hole they buried you in, I thought I would never feel that furious
again. Because what was the point?

Sure, they kept telling me I was angry. Because I snarked at Hilda all the
time. I snarked at her because she was a bitch who keeps stealing stuff out
of the fridge and turns down the heater all the time, anyone would snark at
her. I snarked at the cleaning lady, I snarked at the bus driver. I snarked,
because I couldn't be angry. You would have understood that. Not angry.

Not like I was that day when I saw you hanging there in your torn up
Converse and those jeans I'd washed for you the day before. You had no right
to wear those jeans. Not for that.

But I don't want to talk about that.

So, I got mad. I called your mom's house. What did you expect me to do?
What did you think I would do? They were the ones who had your computer. She
might have had your password, how should I know? I know, I know, I shouldn't
have. I got your mom on the phone and I said "What the hell do you think
you're doing using his IM log-in?"

It was almost funny. She had no idea what I was talking about. There was
this odd little sound like a muted sneeze and she burst into those
hysterical tears of hers and then your sister got on the phone and she
cussed me out and said "Don't ever call here again, you psycho. Haven't you
done enough?"

She still thinks it, you know. Just as she told me at the funeral in that
low, clipped voice of hers. She still thinks it is my fault. It was almost
funny.

She said, she said. She said I shouldn't have left you. That's what she
said.

Now I'm getting angry all over again. I was angry back then, I was angry now
and I wanted to take that bright green bullet and smash it with all the rage
in my head because what the fuck was it doing there? How could it not be
your sister? Who could it be if not your sister?

So I grabbed that green bullet by its throat and I slammed it open and typed
"Who the hell are you?" into the box.

And all you said was - "Let me go"

The new animated paper clip?

<p class=drop>"I have one simple question for you, Eddie. For starters." Mike stared into his captive's 
eyes, "Where is the single space option?"

"I - I don't know what you're talking about."

"The single space option. The single space option," Mike sighed, "The one that allows you to 
lump great amounts of text together into a block or semi-block paragraph."

"I don't know what you're -- aggh!"

Mike punched him. In the face. Hard.

<div class=lpullquote>This is common sense</div>"That is your first warning. You know damn well what I'm talking about. The single space option. 
The single space option that has existed in every writing program and application since 
Windows 3.0. Perhaps even before that. The one that existed alongside a clear, steady upper 
tool bar with the options 'File,' 'Edit,' 'View, 'Insert,' 'Tools' with a much needed 
Spell-Checker, and 'Help.' So, I'm going to ask you again -- where is the single space option?"

"Please, my superiors told me nothing ..."

"Your superiors are irrelevant. This is common sense. I'll ask you again. Where is it?"

"Y-you're holding it. R-right in your hand!"

"This? You mean this?" Mike quivered with rage as he shoved the piece of paper in Eddie's 
terrified eyes, "This is double-space. At the least, 1.5 spacing. Don't pull that structural 
bullshit on me, you cock-sucking little bastard!" 

He kicked the chair the other was tied to, causing him to yelp as he fell to his side, 
"Where is the single space option, motherfucker!?"

"I don't know! I. Don't. Know!" tears streamed down Eddie's cheeks, "Please."

Mike pulled something out. It clicked long and silver as he aimed it at the fallen man's head.

"P-please don't ..."

"Where. Is. The. Single. Space. Option."

"I - I ... wait. Could it ... could be in ..." the man's lips moved without any more sound.

"Yes? Yes? I haven't got all day, you know!"

"Wait. Wait. Try ... try ... Paragraph!"

Mike looked down at Eddie. Consideringly. 

"Paragraph ..."

"Yes! Please God ... yes!"

"Hmm," he put his gun back into his coat sleeve, "One moment."

He went away. Eddie, tied to the chair on the floor sobbed. And he waited. 
And he waited. Finally, he heard footsteps. He felt the chair get lifted up. 

He found himself sitting up again. His captor faced him. In his hand was a 
white sheet of paper. "Single space, right?" he said in even tones.

"Y-yes."

Mike's mouth was pressed into a grim line. He turned the piece of paper around. 
There were words, single-spaced words on the document. But there was something 
else. The top of the words, on each line were cut off. 

Mike sighed, "I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way then," he pulled out a knife.

"Oh. Oh God no."

"Where is the single space option," his eyes turned into venomous slits, 
"And how do I get Times New Roman, you bitch!"

<p class=drop>The transitory mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable enough in
itself, is still more remarkable if Wade's explanation is to be credited.
It sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of intercommunication in
the future, of spending an 
<u onmouseover="Tip('intercalation ' +
'was the word used to describe the process of inserting a time period (e.g. leap year) to ' +
'maintain seasons, but is nowadays used for all sorts of insertions, ' +
'particularly in molecular science')">intercalary</u> 
five minutes on the other side of
the world, or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected
eyes. It happened that I was the immediate witness of Davidson's seizure,
and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper.

When I say that I was the immediate witness of his seizure, I mean that I
was the first on the scene. The thing happened at the Harlow Technical
College, just beyond the Highgate Archway. He was alone in the larger
laboratory when the thing happened. I was in a smaller room, where the
balances are, writing up some notes. The thunderstorm had completely upset
my work, of course. It was just after one of the louder peals that I
thought I heard some glass smash in the other room. I stopped writing, and
turned round to listen. For a moment I heard nothing; the hail was playing
the devil's tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof. Then came another
sound, a smash--no doubt of it this time. Something heavy had been knocked
off the bench. I jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading
into the big laboratory.

I was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing
unsteadily in the middle of the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My
first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was
clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put out
his hand, slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing. "What's
come to it?" he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers spread
out. "Great Scott!" he said. The thing happened three or four years ago,
when every one swore by <u onmouseover="Tip('referring, of course, to Captain '+
'Robert Scott, who perished on the return journey from being the second	'+
'expedition to reach the South Pole.')">that personage</u>.
Then he began raising his feet
clumsily, as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor.

"Davidson!" cried I. "What's the matter with you?" He turned round in my
direction and looked about for me. He looked over me and at me and on
either side of me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. "Waves," he
said; "and a remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellow's voice.
_Hullo_!" He shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.

I thought he was up to some foolery. Then I saw littered about his feet
the shattered remains of the best of our <u onmouseover="Tip('an early voltmeter')">electrometers</u>. 
"What's up, man?"
said I. "You've smashed the electrometer!"

"Bellows again!" said he. "Friends left, if my hands are gone. Something
about electrometers. Which way <i>are</i> you, Bellows?" He suddenly came
staggering towards me. "The damned stuff cuts like butter," he said. He
walked straight into the bench and recoiled. "None so buttery that!" he
said, and stood swaying.

I felt scared. "Davidson," said I, "What on earth's come over you?"

He looked round him in every direction. "I could swear that was Bellows.
Why don't you show yourself like a man, Bellows?"

It occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind. I walked round
the table and laid my hand upon his arm. I never saw a man more startled
in my life. He jumped away from me, and came round into an attitude of
self-defence, his face fairly distorted with terror. "Good God!" he cried.
"What was that?"

"It's I - Bellows. Confound it, Davidson!"

He jumped when I answered him and stared - how can I express it? - right
through me. He began talking, not to me, but to himself. "Here in broad
daylight on a clear beach. Not a place to hide in." He looked about him
wildly. "Here! I'm <i>off</i>." He suddenly turned and ran headlong into
the big electro-magnet - so violently that, as we found afterwards, he
bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly. At that he stepped back a pace,
and cried out with almost a whimper, "What, in Heaven's name, has come
over me?" He stood, blanched with terror and trembling violently, with his
right arm clutching his left, where that had collided with the magnet.

By that time I was excited and fairly scared. "Davidson," said I, "Don't
be afraid."

He was startled at my voice, but not so excessively as before. I repeated
my words in as clear and as firm a tone as I could assume. "Bellows," he
said, "Is that you?"

"Can't you see it's me?"

He laughed. "I can't even see it's myself. Where the devil are we?"

"Here," said I, "in the laboratory."

"The laboratory!" he answered in a puzzled tone, and put his hand to his
forehead. "I <i>was</i> in the laboratory - till that flash came, but I'm
hanged if I'm there now. What ship is that?"

"There's no ship," said I. "Do be sensible, old chap."

"No ship!" he repeated, and seemed to forget my denial forthwith. "I
suppose," said he slowly, "We're both dead. But the rummy part is I feel
just as though I still had a body. Don't get used to it all at once, I
suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick
thing, Bellows - eigh?"

"Don't talk nonsense. You're very much alive. You are in the laboratory,
blundering about. You've just smashed a new electrometer. I don't envy you
when Boyce arrives."

He stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates. "I must be
deaf," said he. "They've fired a gun, for there goes the puff of smoke,
and I never heard a sound."

I put my hand on his arm again, and this time he was less alarmed. "We
seem to have a sort of invisible bodies," said he. "By Jove! there's a
boat coming round the headland. It's very much like the old life after
all - in a different climate."

I shook his arm. "Davidson," I cried, "wake up!"


<p class=drop>It was just then that Boyce came in. So soon as he spoke Davidson
exclaimed: "Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!" I hastened to explain that
Davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance. Boyce was interested at
once. We both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his
extraordinary state. He answered our questions, and asked us some of his
own, but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a
beach and a ship. He kept interpolating observations concerning some boat
and the davits, and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel queer,
in the dusky laboratory, to hear him saying such things.

<div class=lpullquote>... presently I saw in the
midst of the tumult, and by the light of the fish, a bit of splintered
spar looming over me, and a dark hull tilting over, and some glowing
phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them...</div>
He was blind and helpless. We had to walk him down the passage, one at
each elbow, to Boyce's private room, and while Boyce talked to him there,
and humoured him about this ship idea, I went along the corridor and asked
old Wade to come and look at him. The voice of our Dean sobered him a
little, but not very much. He asked where his hands were, and why he had
to walk about up to his waist in the ground. Wade thought over him a long
time--you know how he knits his brows--and then made him feel the couch,
guiding his hands to it. "That's a couch," said Wade. "The couch in the
private room of Professor Boyce. Horse-hair stuffing."

Davidson felt about, and puzzled over it, and answered presently that he
could feel it all right, but he couldn't see it.

"What <i>do</i> you see?" asked Wade. Davidson said he could see nothing
but a lot of sand and broken-up shells. Wade gave him some other things to
feel, telling him what they were, and watching him keenly.

"The ship is almost hull down," said Davidson presently, <i>apropos</i> of
nothing.

"Never mind the ship," said Wade. "Listen to me, Davidson. Do you know
what hallucination means?"

"Rather," said Davidson.

"Well, everything you see is hallucinatory."

"<u onmouseover="Tip('Berkeley, 18th century philosopher, declared that '+
'when something was not being perceived, it ceased to exist')">Bishop Berkeley</u>," said Davidson.

"Don't mistake me," said Wade. "You are alive and in this room of Boyce's.
But something has happened to your eyes. You cannot see; you can feel and
hear, but not see. Do you follow me?"

"It seems to me that I see too much." Davidson rubbed his knuckles into
his eyes. "Well?" he said.

"That's all. Don't let it perplex you. Bellows here and I will take you
home in a cab."

"Wait a bit." Davidson thought. "Help me to sit down," said he presently;
"And now--I'm sorry to trouble you--but will you tell me all that over
again?"

Wade repeated it very patiently. Davidson shut his eyes, and pressed his
hands upon his forehead. "Yes," said he. "It's quite right. Now my eyes
are shut I know you're right. That's you, Bellows, sitting by me on the
couch. I'm in England again. And we're in the dark."

Then he opened his eyes. "And there," said he, "is the sun just rising,
and the yards of the ship, and a tumbled sea, and a couple of birds
flying. I never saw anything so real. And I'm sitting up to my neck in a
bank of sand."

He bent forward and covered his face with his hands. Then he opened his
eyes again. "Dark sea and sunrise! And yet I'm sitting on a sofa in old
Boyce's room!... God help me!"


<p class=drop>That was the beginning. For three weeks this strange affection of
Davidson's eyes continued unabated. It was far worse than being blind. He
was absolutely helpless, and had to be fed like a newly-hatched bird, and
led about and undressed. If he attempted to move, he fell over things or
struck himself against walls or doors. After a day or so he got used to
hearing our voices without seeing us, and willingly admitted he was at
home, and that Wade was right in what he told him. My sister, to whom he
was engaged, insisted on coming to see him, and would sit for hours every
day while he talked about this beach of his. Holding her hand seemed to
comfort him immensely. He explained that when we left the College and
drove home - he lived in Hampstead village - it appeared to him as if we
drove right through a sandhill - it was perfectly black until he emerged
again - and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles, and when he was
taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear
of falling, because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet
above the rocks of his imaginary island. He kept saying he should smash
all the eggs. The end was that he had to be taken down into his father's
consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there.

He described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole, with
very little vegetation, except some peaty stuff, and a lot of bare rock.
There were multitudes of penguins, and they made the rocks white and
disagreeable to see. The sea was often rough, and once there was a
thunderstorm, and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes. Once or twice
seals pulled up on the beach, but only on the first two or three days. He
said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right
through him, and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them.

I remember one odd thing, and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke.
We put a pipe in his hands - he almost poked his eye out with it - and lit
it. But he couldn't taste anything. I've since found it's the same with
me - I don't know if it's the usual case - that I cannot enjoy tobacco at
all unless I can see the smoke.

But the queerest part of his vision came when Wade sent him out in a
<u onmouseover="Tip('old-fashioned wheelchair')">Bath-chair</u> to get fresh 
air. The Davidsons hired a chair, and got that
deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs, Widgery, to attend to it.
Widgery's ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar. My sister, who had
been to the Dogs' Home, met them in Camden Town, towards King's Cross,
Widgery trotting along complacently, and Davidson, evidently most
distressed, trying in his feeble, blind way to attract Widgery's
attention.

He positively wept when my sister spoke to him. "Oh, get me out of this
horrible darkness!" he said, feeling for her hand. "I must get out of it,
or I shall die." He was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter,
but my sister decided he must go home, and presently, as they went uphill
towards Hampstead, the horror seemed to drop from him. He said it was good
to see the stars again, though it was then about noon and a blazing day.

"It seemed," he told me afterwards, "as if I was being carried
irresistibly towards the water. I was not very much alarmed at first. Of
course it was night there--a lovely night."

"Of course?" I asked, for that struck me as odd.

"Of course," said he. "It's always night there when it is day here...
Well, we went right into the water, which was calm and shining under the
moonlight--just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as I
came down into it. The surface glistened just like a skin--it might have
been empty space underneath for all I could tell to the contrary. Very
slowly, for I rode slanting into it, the water crept up to my eyes. Then I
went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes. The
moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim, and fish, faintly
glowing, came darting round me--and things that seemed made of luminous
glass; and I passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily
lustre. And so I drove down into the sea, and the stars went out one by
one, and the moon grew greener and darker, and the seaweed became a
luminous purple-red. It was all very faint and mysterious, and everything
seemed to quiver. And all the while I could hear the wheels of the
Bath-chair creaking, and the footsteps of people going by, and a man in
the distance selling the special <i><u onmouseover=
"Tip('probably The Pall Mall Gazette, a London evening newspaper')"> Pall Mall</u></i>.

"I kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water. It became inky
black about me, not a ray from above came down into that darkness, and the
phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter. The snaky branches of
the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit-lamps; but, after a
time, there were no more weeds. The fishes came staring and gaping towards
me, and into me and through me. I never imagined such fishes before. They
had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined
with a luminous pencil. And there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards
with a lot of twining arms. And then I saw, coming very slowly towards me
through the gloom, a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew
nearer into multitudes of fishes, struggling and darting round something
that drifted. I drove on straight towards it, and presently I saw in the
midst of the tumult, and by the light of the fish, a bit of splintered
spar looming over me, and a dark hull tilting over, and some glowing
phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them.
Then it was I began to try to attract Widgery's attention. A horror came
upon me. Ugh! I should have driven right into those half-eaten--things. If
your sister had not come! They had great holes in them, Bellows, and ...
Never mind. But it was ghastly!"


<p class=drop>For three weeks Davidson remained in this singular state, seeing what at
the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world, and stone blind
to the world around him. Then, one Tuesday, when I called I met old
Davidson in the passage. "He can see his thumb!" the old gentleman said,
in a perfect transport. He was struggling into his overcoat. "He can see
his thumb, Bellows!" he said, with the tears in his eyes. "The lad will be
all right yet."

I rushed in to Davidson. He was holding up a little book before his face,
and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way.

"It's amazing," said he. "There's a kind of patch come there." He pointed
with his finger. "I'm on the rocks as usual, and the penguins are
staggering and flapping about as usual, and there's been a whale showing
every now and then, but it's got too dark now to make him out. But put
something <i>there</i>, and I see it - I do see it. It's very dim and
broken in places, but I see it all the same, like a faint spectre of
itself. I found it out this morning while they were dressing me. It's like
a hole in this infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine. No - not
there. Ah! Yes! I see it. The base of your thumb and a bit of cuff! It
looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling
sky. Just by it there's a group of stars like a cross coming out."

From that time Davidson began to mend. His account of the change, like his
account of the vision, was oddly convincing. Over patches of his field of
vision, the phantom world grew fainter, grew transparent, as it were, and
through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about
him. The patches grew in size and number, ran together and spread until
only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes. He was able to
get up and steer himself about, feed himself once more, read, smoke, and
behave like an ordinary citizen again. At first it was very confusing to
him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing
views of a lantern, but in a little while he began to distinguish the real
from the illusory.

At first he was unfeignedly glad, and seemed only too anxious to complete
his cure by taking exercise and tonics. But as that odd island of his
began to fade away from him, he became queerly interested in it. He wanted
particularly to go down into the deep sea again, and would spend half his
time wandering about the low-lying parts of London, trying to find the
water-logged wreck he had seen drifting. The glare of real daylight very
soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy
world, but of a night-time, in a darkened room, he could still see the
white-splashed rocks of the island, and the clumsy penguins staggering to
and fro. But even these grew fainter and fainter, and, at last, soon after
he married my sister, he saw them for the last time.


<p class=drop>And now to tell of the queerest thing of all. About two years after his
cure I dined with the Davidsons, and after dinner a man named Atkins
called in. He is a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and a pleasant, talkative
man. He was on friendly terms with my brother-in-law, and was soon on
friendly terms with me. It came out that he was engaged to Davidson's
cousin, and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to
show us a new rendering of his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. "And, by-the-by," said he,
"here's the old <i>Fulmar</i>."

Davidson looked at it casually. Then suddenly his face lit up. "Good
heavens!" said he. "I could almost swear -"

"What?" said Atkins.

"That I had seen that ship before."

"Don't see how you can have. She hasn't been out of the South Seas for six
years, and before then -"

"But," began Davidson, and then, "Yes - that's the ship I dreamt of; I'm
sure that's the ship I dreamt of. She was standing off an island that
swarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun."

"Good Lord!" said Atkins, who had never heard the particulars of the
seizure. "How the deuce could you dream that?"

And then, bit by bit, it came out that on the very day Davidson was
seized, H.M.S. <i>Fulmar</i> had actually been off a little rock to the
south of Antipodes Island. A boat had landed overnight to get penguins'
eggs, had been delayed, and a thunderstorm drifting up, the boat's crew
had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship. Atkins had been
one of them, and he corroborated, word for word, the descriptions Davidson
had given of the island and the boat. There is not the slightest doubt in
any of our minds that Davidson has really seen the place. In some
unaccountable way, while he moved hither and thither in London, his sight
moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded, about this distant
island. <i>How</i> is absolutely a mystery.

That completes the remarkable story of Davidson's eyes. It's perhaps the
best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance.
Explanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has
thrown out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a
dissertation on theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being "a kink
in space" seems mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no
mathematician. When I said that nothing would alter the fact that the
place is eight thousand miles away, he answered that two points might be a
yard away on a sheet of paper, and yet be 
<u onmouseover="Tip('This story was written in or before 1895, ' +
'yet the hyperspace idea was already current, it appears.')">
brought together by bending the
paper round</u>. The reader may grasp his argument, but I certainly do not.
His idea seems to be that Davidson, stooping between the poles of the big
electro-magnet, had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements
through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning.

He thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live
visually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He
has even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he
has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net
result of his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly I
have been so busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras
installation that I have had little opportunity of calling to see him. But
the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning
Davidson stand on an altogether different footing, and I can testify
personally to the accuracy of every detail I have given.

Children's Book Author Shot at Signing Event. Were the books that bad?
[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>These days, who you spend the rest of your life with has a lot less
to do with finding your soul mate and a lot more to do with when you
die. So, here, bleeding to death on the floor of the Borders
Superstore, under the brighter than near-death halogens, the moms
and their children crowded around, the staff watching the young,
pissed-off divorc&eacute;e running out the emergency exit, the blonde wig
caught in the door when the alarm goes off - right now it looks like
I spend the rest of my life with Geraldine Marie Celeste, and we
haven't ever even slept together. My most successful adult
relationship was with my literary agent, and she doesn't even know
my real name. 

Lying here, Rorschaching my pedestrian type 'O' all
over the carpet, Geraldine leans over me. Red Yves Saint-Laurent
skirt riding up her black nylon thighs, she takes a Gauloise from
her purse and models it between her new porcelain teeth for which I
no doubt paid. 

"This carpet was selected in Denver by a team of
Swiss design consultants," she quotes me from a company marketing
prospectus she swiped, "Chosen for its calming effects and ability
to conceal most minor stains. It's the same in every store; it
promotes certain alpha waves conducive to calm purchasing and
browsing." 

Keeping the victim alert and calm is important in any
first-aid situation. 

She looks at the ever growing puddle of me,
"But I don't think that it will be able to conceal this." Here on
the floor my limbs are turning to ice. I tell Geraldine, this is it,
this is my dramatic exit, my big goodbye, my close-up, my death
scene finale. Then I actually say it, really, utter those clich&eacute;d
words: "I'm so cold." 

<div class=pullquote>The alarm from the emergency door is still ringing,
the wig swinging in it like the severed tail of a woodland creature.</div>
Geraldine groans, a puff of French smoke
escaping through her nostrils. "Of course you are. They keep the
temperatures just sub-arctic to promote customers' continuous
movement. In order to stay warm, they have to keep moving, keep
browsing. It also triggers the urge for a warm drink, say overpriced
coffee beverages." 

And once again, it's not about me. 

All my
prepubescent male fans are gathered around horrified, their faces
rewound versions of all their moms, looking on in shock and
sympathy. Down here my vision is reduced to a forest of single mom
legs, to smooth calves in pumps and trainers, a micro-wonderland of
Manolo Blahnik's, Jimmy Choo's, Yohji Yamamoto Adidas; all their
money goes straight to the feet.  I could so totally get laid here
tonight, with all the sympathy projected at me.   

For years, I
didn't know women could wear things like this. I didn't know they
existed. I spent the first half of my life being taught dogmatically
how to idolize women, the second half trying to learn how to
objectify them. I never really caught up. At 38 and halfway through
a book tour, life has become just another story you tell yourself,
just another coping strategy in a long history of misguided
reinvention.  Being gut shot isn't so much as a step down as what
they call a lateral move. 

The gunshot wound, the GSW to be all hip
and technical, it doesn't always have to hurt. It could resemble
gastroenteritis creeping through your bowels. It could be
appendicitis, gallstones, or a urinary tract infection. This is
tolerable, really. 

We always over dramatize. 

Geraldine is leaning
over me. I can see the strand of pearls dangling between the soft
white half-moons of her breasts framed between the menstrual
burgundy lapels of her blazer. She tells me it's not as bad as it
looks. 

This is always true, except for the last time, then it <b><i>is</i></b> as
bad as it looks. 

The alarm from the emergency door is still ringing,
the wig swinging in it like the severed tail of a woodland creature.
Moms and kids have begun to gush. It's a pity party for yours truly,
a validation of all my hard work at avoiding the real story in my
life. By the strand of pearls, I pull Geraldine down closer to me.

"Give me some tampons." 

"It's not my time of the month, sorry."

"Tampons, they can work as field dressings." Tampons are just the
right size for stuffing small caliber wounds. They are made to
absorb blood after all. 

One day I was going to write a real book, I
swear. 

Geraldine puts her cigarette in my mouth; it's red, glossy
and wet with the taste of her. She searches through her purse,
eventually producing a can of Mace and some hotel mints. I vaguely
roll my head at the lines of mothers gathered National Geographic
herd style around me, the fallen zebra. Geraldine sighs and stands
up, her skirt not quite falling back down, and you can see she's
wearing black lace garters and matching underwear hugs the cleft of
her ass. Geraldine asks very loudly, do any of the women have some
tampons for the shot author? They would really help, as bandages,
she says.  

Like it was her idea. 

And the mothers all reach into
their purses and pull out hundreds of multi-color wrappers, a
rainbow of tampons which Geraldine brings over to me, smile amped up
like she's about to tell me what I've won. 

I ask Geraldine, "Are
there any, you know, like organs lying around?"  If there are, I
tell her, she has to pick them up with something clean, and lay them
on my chest till the paramedics arrive. Meanwhile, she should try
and stuff some tampon padding into the wound. She isn't happy about
any of this, but takes her cigarette out of my mouth and puts it
back into hers, which is the closest we've come to kissing unless
you count Ibiza. She starts opening the tampons. 

First aid is about
stabilizing the victim until the paramedics arrive. Paramedics
stabilize you until you can be moved to the ER, where they stabilize
you until you can go to the OR. It's all a game of keeping you alive
long enough until you are someone else's problem.  

Tell me about it.

Geraldine, stuffing the tampons into the hole in my abdomen, the
moms covering their sons' eyes, she says, "I think you're often more
trouble than you're worth." 

She says, "This isn't in our contract."

Alexander, the glossy 2D cardboard cartoon version of me, lording
above us, wouldn't disagree. He's my ticket to all of this - the
money, the fame, the sex. The little bastard, a cyberspace version
of Harry Potter, everyone's fucking hero. Standing there with his
impossible smile, surely he and Geraldine have the same dentist.
He's just waiting for me die; he's been waiting for it since we were
kids. You could say I owe it to him, the little fucker.

<p class=drop>Before The Colony, before Dr. Charlotte Wang, before
writing the Alexander series, before pimping my inner child to get laid,
before being gut shot at the Border's Superstore, there was Mother,
Father, Alex and me. Then there was just me and Mom, and gradually less
of Mom, really, with a little bit of her slipping away each day. 

Here was Dad being all Saturday morning cartoon Popeye on his particular
strain of spinach. In Dad's case, it came in clear glass bottles, but it
seemed to work all the same. He'd get really crazy and really strong,
mushing his vowel sounds just like the little sailor and always ready to
tussle, especially with Mom. 

I can see Mom getting knocked to the floor,
being totally this face of surprise at how fast she got there. I can see
Alex, my little brother, by all of thirteen minutes - but important when
you're both seven - starting to wail, not seeing it for the really good
show it is, and Dad giving him a little of the old Popeye forearm. Only
Alex was smaller than Mom and flew back, hitting the corner of the
downstairs table, his head making that jarring cracking noise, like when
a piece of wood pops in the fire. 

Then the big gaping hole of mother's
scream, like a Muppet, and how I could see that little dangling thing
that hangs down. Her scream came on as a train and Dad's spinach wearing
off right then, shocked by how things had gone. Alex was clearly not
going to get up from that tussle and I, stupid little shit that I was,
laughed this little giggle, the only thing I could do. 

Mom came out from
behind the bar and leveled the gun at Dad. The barrel made a ratchet
noise like the sprinkler when it twisted back before it sprayed the
lawn. Dad made those big bulging cartoon eyes of shock.  Then there was
the bang, a big hole in Dad and another mess on the floor. 

And that's
how my family went from four to two in the space of an afternoon. Mom
and I wound up living out of motels and stolen cars until she wandered
into the stranger wilds of the militant feminist hardcore movement
dragging me along with her.

Here I am now, in the thick tangle of the morphine, or of whatever pain
killers they gave me, in the warm confusion of the hypovolemic shock
that's set in. All of it is tangled together now, ropes of semen-like
stickiness. I'm inside of it, gummy and pressing, my movement coming as
some slow-motion, narcoticized mime. Alexander is here, though if he's
my brother or my character I can't say for sure, but he's blaming me for
everything. 

After he died, it was all on me, the blame not divided two
ways anymore, and the more you can divide something the less it has to
feel. But now it's all on me again, here in this medicinal womb. My
fault for his being written as a latch-key kid, for living in a
role-playing game online, for his mom being divorced, for his being
dead.  

But it's all so cool with me right now; it's all very groovy and
psychedelic here in the warm cozy shell of pharmacological denial. Here,
it isn't my fault, not any of it - not the dead brother, not the profiting
from his memory, not the validation sex, and certainly not my
tremendous inability to cope with members of the opposite sex. All of
that is Mom's fault, Mom and Dr. Charlotte Wang.  

Just stabilize please,
long enough for it to be someone else's problem, long enough to pass the
blame. Here is good, here I can just curl up into this milky white muck
and regress...

<p class=drop>Picture a half Chinese girl on a Tennessee playground, glasses nerd
regulation thick. She's in a lime green sweater being teased by the
boy-ape hicks of her particular yardage of the Bible belt. The boy-apes
hurling insults to the twanging rhyme of "Charlotte Wang knows
everythang." And this little girl, behind her ashtray lenses, holding
back her tears, her big super brain and yellow skin making it really
impossible to get along here, she's forming a whole well of displaced
hatred. The boys taking it farther and farther, one day too far
altogether, and nothing ever being the same after that, not for any of
us. This girl retreats inside, deciding those little teenage rapist
bastards were right about one thing, Charlotte Wang does know
everything.
 
Mom and I bounced around the country, motel rooms strung together like
post cards from the depths of one really horrible, unending summer
vacation.  

"Hello from Shithole Arkansas!"  

"Truck Stop 22, Your Last Chance For Pussy Before Texas!"  

"Greetings From Crawdad! Homemade Meth Capital of Mississippi!" 

The monotony of the looping road giving her
time to come to the conclusion that Dad killed Alex, Dad was a man, men
were therefore a bad, bad thing. So, when the two of us had come upon
Charlotte preaching the same ideology around bonfires at midnight
rallies, well of course they were going to hit it off. And when two
angry, lonely women decide to take on half the species together, it
isn't surprising they're going to call it love. Maybe it even is.
Charlotte started The Colony in southern California, and that's where,
for the most part, I was raised.

Picture The Colony as a Star Trek episode written by Valerie Solanas
minus the itchy trigger finger for Andy Warhol. Picture Hippie Space Chicks done
up in diaphanous pastels, wearing odd, angular jewelry, soft lit by the
sun and smelling of the orange groves the men tended. All of them living
in a matriarchal society that Charlotte preached would inherit the
earth; only by the time they did they wouldn't be the meek. They'd be
the smart, brilliant, rightful heirs to the global brain of "Mother
Gaia" which alternately was expressed by Charlotte as a collective
acid-trip telepathy experience or something like a networked computer
hive-mind. Charlotte really did know just about "everything", or anyway,
so it seemed to an eight year old boy whose mother had disappeared into
a world of hate, utopian madness and misdirected grief and guilt. 

It's a
recruitment drive in Tuscaloosa, Charlotte all Der Furher behind a box
podium at the state fair. Over a hundred sweat-drenched women rallied
around her as she took the stage of the beauty pageant. The contestants'
perma-grins turning into horror as all the angry women were riled by
Charlotte's fist waving speech. Those scared, defenseless pageant girls,
quivering in their swimsuit competition outfits. Oh! Just seeing them,
I'd picture Neanderthal scenes, bestial rutting, shadows locked together
in frenzied coupling, thrown up as on some cave wall.  With everything I
wanted to do to them playing out in one lugubrious porno spool of
pre-adolescent boy-fantasy, right then I could see where maybe Charlotte
was right.

But, no, I'd get bused back to The Colony. I'd tend the orange groves
with the other boys, clean the cabins, sew the clothes and cook the
meals, do all your chores and hope that maybe one of the girls would
want to have you visit her one night. The hope was one would want you to
have you service her, as they sometimes did, just so you could do your
thing, just so she could see what it was like. Later, after dumping my
DNA, not impressing her much at all, one of the girls showed me where to
listen in on one of Charlotte's lectures. She was preaching to the women
about re-writing the program. Men, it seemed, were little monkeys wired
for epileptic spasms of humping, trying to get their code into the
nearest port, replicate their sad little programs. They had wired the
world, using their penis and the Y chromosome to set things up a certain
way, but that isn't how it had to be. It could all be written over
again, you just had to change your part in the narrative, said Charlotte.
Everything is a story, a program waiting to be hacked.


Here in the warm halogen center of an antiseptic white room, the paper
angels speak in the technical language of Elysium, words like
<b><i>laparotomy, medial visceral rotation, proximal flesh wound</i></b>... the angels
are searching my guts with their smooth latex hands; they are looking
for my soul. Covered in their effort to find my sacred little center,
the angels are here to save me. Each one, so beautiful. Especially that
one, so familiar, like the angel who shot me, only more like a man now,
but in a yellow paper outfit and mask. That angel has forgotten to
remove one of his earrings, but no one else seems to notice. And he's
looking at me, scaring me because this one isn't an angel at all. And
he's smiling behind his heavenly mask, so as to keep my mortal germs off 
him. This beautiful man looks so much like someone I'm sure I used to
know.


Sometimes I wake up above flyover country. You know where it is, you
probably live there. It's between the coasts, between the places people
actually want to go. I wake up under the hiss of climate control, and
the shoals of clouds outside my first class window start to describe a
trail of all the twisted sheets, smudged lipstick, and violated mothers
that I left behind. Keep moving, stay ahead. It looks worse than it is,
really, except for the last time of course. 

Then it <b><i>is</i></b> as bad as it
looks. 

They're all the same, all fractioned off from the same damaged
girl archetype. Abused, used, and now looking for more, the Tammys and
Taras, the Arlenes and Monas. You know who these girls are, you probably
are one, right now waiting for "the one", not Prince Charming, but the
guy Prince Charming keeps in the dungeon. It's love me, hate me, fuck
me, validate me, then treat me like shit. They all want to feel like
crap; they want what I'm willing to be. I fold neatly into the narrative
of their lives.

<p class=drop>There I am, look at me. The line out the door, everybody is excited to
meet the author and shake his hand, none of them knowing he's going to
be getting shot here in just a few minutes, none of them knowing that
today they're going to get to be on the news. 

And everybody wants to be on TV, it's so validating. 

Meet Jamie Box from Boise which is in Idaho.
She's brought her son; he's dressed up as one of the Furies 2.0. The
Furies are mean, female avatars running loose in my books. Look at this
poor kid, nine years old and well on his way to gender dysphoria. 

I can relate. 

Meet Jeanette and Billy Marsh. Meet Fran and Marvin Kelsey. Meet
Tara and Nathan Whoever. 

While in line, little elf-like store helpers
have written the boys and mother's names on post-it notes on the title
pages. All I have to do is write "to", copy their name, and sign my own.
It's an assembly line. Every book, every signature I give, I'm tracking
your love, your approval of my sad little soul. I mark it in the lines
at these signings, the Amazon sales numbers, the royalty checks, even
the stupid costumes in which you and your kids show up. I'm smiling at
you and asking your name. It's going on my list with a little tick, one
more drop in the bucket for "Telethon Me". Field a few questions, smile,
nod, pose for a picture. 

How many of you get your photos back and wonder
why the author looks like he's about to cry? How many of you wonder if
the author is staring down your dress? You think I write these little
Alexander books because I enjoy them? Every word I write is a plea;
every letter is begging you: please, love me, pay attention to me,
redeem my sick and twisted childhood, pay me for my misery. Help me
franchise and sell enough of my fictional childhood and maybe the real
one doesn't feel so original, the real one doesn't hurt so much. 

Look at
this kid, coming up, his eyes agog, seeing his hero, you know, a r&ocirc;le
model and the mother, in her Made in Malaysia sweater, is hoping I can
be the same for her. You're pushing middle age honey; you're saddled
with a kid, and that sneaking suspicion that no man will ever really
want you again, for the long haul?  It's dead-on. We're scum, the lot of
us. My prescription: take two Oprahs and call a suicide hotline in the
morning. Next. 

But I just smile and sign the book. I hate her, I hate
all of them, I hate you because you adore me. That's proof enough you
are all defective. Except for the pissed off blond, the young one
reaching into the purse, I don't hate that one. With blue eyes peeking
over shades perched just so on the bridge of an avian nose, the next
moments break down into Tarantino storyboards. The platinum blond,
pulling out the gun, the sweep of the wig cutting the air, the wet,
labial pink of over-glossed lips as the gun finds yours truly. This one
who looks so familiar, pointing the gun, the crowd screaming. Me
mouthing this unspoken plea in the air between us as the barrel turns
and loads its wad. 

"Please don't fuck this up."

<p class=drop>Somewhere in the dark, hospital non-hours of night, waking to the steady
distal pulse of my own beating flesh echoed on the electronic monitors,
I'm reminded of nights in Charlotte's medical compound, the physical
center of all her warped, tormented dreams. Every now and then, from
whatever chore you were doing, one of the space-honeys would call you
in, and you'd go up to the looming brown building on the hill, to the
coolness of air-conditioning and clean rooms. I'd have tests, cultures,
samples, bits of this and that taken, all in Charlotte's effort to
release her sex from needing ours to keep the species from a product
recall. Charlotte was waging a one woman war with the Y chromosome; it
was her locus of obsession, the point at which all her dementia converged.
Charlotte would put it in simple terms your defective man-brain
could understand. There are these chromosomes and, on these chromosomes
sit your genes. Picture them like these little DNA crows ranged along
telephone wire outside the white trash neighborhood of your gene pool.
They sit there, these crows, these genes. There's a cystic fibrosis
gene, genes for various muscular dystrophies, several forms of cancer,
and on your Y chromosome, the gene that causes maleness. Think of it
like any other inherited disease. Mr. Bojangles is just a functional
tumor; your testosterone is just the antibody to the cancer that is
you. Charlotte is the Mr. Wizard of matriarchal genetics. 

But those
nights weren't so bad, being poked and prodded and for the first time
looked after by females. So that tonight, I'm not altogether displaced
here among the machine dreams and coded sounds of the hospital, watching
the orderly consult my IV with a practiced eye. He smiles at me with a
face so very familiar. Look, there I am, giving myself a shot. Or rather
Alex is. Nice of him, he's all grown up, telling me it's going to be OK,
I won't feel a thing. I smile and nod, and I'm sure Alex is right. I'm
sure I won't. It feels warm, the sensation of medicine being pushed into
my vein. Funny, really, something other than my heart is motivating my
blood. And is that the hint of lipstick Alex still has on? Bubblegum
Orgy if I'm not mistaken, it's really big with certain Japanese
schoolgirls. Don't ask me how I know this. 

Alex is my avenging angel;
he's come to get his due. My man-brain takes over, fight or flight
atavisms kicking in. There's an overdose in that syringe, says the brain
stem, and overdose means death. Death is bad says the brain stem. My
frontal lobe would argue, but brain stem is off and running with those
ancient lizard legs that first tasted land. Brain-stem is making all the
decisions for us now. The body listens to brain stem and rolls off of
the bed, pulling the IV right out of my arm with a little pop, a
contrail of crimson blood arcing up above me.   

Alex yells, but it's
very far away behind the nice cotton buffer of the drug he started to
give me; then he's on top of me, and I'm looking at myself, rewound to
half my actual age. I say to myself, "Jesus, I really don't have a lot
to look forward to. I really look like shit." 

Then I try to strangle
myself, reaching out from above me, straddled on top of myself. From out
of the intervening years between us, Alex's two ghost arms are wrapped
around our throat.  Squeezing and squeezing because he really shouldn't
have been the one that died. Gripping tighter for each year he's missed.
His eyes a fury for it being all my fault. Just like everyone else,
passing the blame along. Then Alex groans because brain stem has told
the body to knee him right in the crotch.  Laying there, grabbing
himself and wincing in pain, looking a lot like how Alex might have
looked if he'd grown up. His eyes all teary and his voice this neutered
whine, he's wanting to know how I could have left his mom, just like
that. 

"Which one, which one was your mom?" not the best way to phrase
it, I'll admit. But there isn't time for reconsideration, as Alex has
that gun out again, ready to reenact our little drama from this morning,
only this time getting it right. I'm out the door, down a blurred fugue
of white on white hospital corridor, of biohazard warnings, bleating
machines, out the fire door and gone.

<p class=drop>Geraldine looks at me from under the ghastly lighting scheme of a 2AM
diner. Her blue DKNY pants suit is offset against the rough stone work
of the Googie style restaurant. Tonight her lips are the blood red of
vampire flicks, the fantasy sanguine of certain fetishes. The specific
color is called My Beating Heart if I'm not mistaken. After footwear I
became obsessed with women's lips. I'm wearing some emergency clothes
she carries in her trunk when I'm on tour in the event of a midnight
escape from some woman's balcony or a half-hearted suicide attempt in a
hotel swimming pool. Geraldine is smoking her Gauloises, her mouth
performing precise, tight little 'O' kisses around the wet pale tip. She
isn't saying anything, just blowing on her coffee. I've laid out the
whole sordid history of my past and Geraldine's looking as if I'm a
favorite horse that might have to be put down. 

"You should be back in
the hospital," her perfect smoke ring floating between us. Peritonitis
could set in, some internal sutures might have been torn, I could bleed
out, exsanguinate right here. Really, I swear. Geraldine reaches into
her purse and pulls out a prescription bottle of Percocet. She filters
out two shiny pills and slides them across the table, then makes her
eyebrow into a question mark, saying: "Or should I just give you the
<b><i>whole</i></b> bottle?" 

I tell her I ran <b><i>away</i></b> from a gun-wielding madman.

"Who's your son." 

I nod. 

"From The Colony, where you had sex with beautiful
space hippies." 

I nod. 

"Where you picked oranges and were taught that
woman shall inherit the Earth." 

I nod. 

Geraldine lights another
cigarette off the butt of her current one, sucking in a big,
lipstick-wet cumulous of smoke. "You know, this morning I thought you
arranged this whole thing as an elaborate suicide farewell." 

"And now?"

"Now I think you've got an even better story. This whole 'crazy mom takes
young, famous author into a feminist hippie cult'? This is money, no two
ways about it." Sublimate. Pimp your childhood. 

Geraldine sees me being
all contemplative and sighs... "What?"

"I need you to drive me to Southern
California." 

She calls the waitress for the check. She puts out
her Gauloise with a ferocious twist of her white lacquered nails. "I'm
supposed to believe this?" 

I shrug.

"You're not going to <b><i>find</i></b> yourself
or anything out there, you know? This isn't a movie or anything." 

Of course it is. It's the movie of my life.

<p class=drop>Geraldine drives a sensible, yet stylish cobalt blue BMW. It has power
and efficiency, both of which I fundamentally lack at this early Sonoma
hour. Under this cocktail dawn you want to see poured into a fresh
martini glasses, The Colony seems to be all but abandoned. The well
ordered groves picked clean and the lodges in disrepair. Peeling paint
on old clapboard has gone the universal silver of old wood under the
sun. Screen doors squeak in the wind, grass having since reclaimed old
paths. Geraldine surveys the landscape from behind her neutral zone of
Armani shades and lights another cigarette. "This place is a real dump."

It's not the Edenic Paradise from nearly two decades ago. All the space
honeys have beamed up to Charlotte's final frontier, the last crazy away
mission in her master plan for the species, gendercide. 

I tell her to
drive us up to the medical center. She rolls her eyes under those
two-hundred dollar frames and flicks out her French cigarette. I watch
it skip and spark across my childhood as I get back into the car.

Yellow Ryder moving vans gather in front of the squat medical center, a
60's throwback to Bauhaus. Women are loading boxes. Strong women,
beautiful women, older now, but they still radiate that opiate of belief
that Charlotte spews. Twenty years ago, one of them may have had a
forgettable night with yours truly, letting me dump my code, bringing
buggy operations down upon the whole system all these years later. 

Two younger girls appear - twins, blonde, tawny and all Doublemint fantasy.
Fantasy, until I catch them from another angle as they turn. I see they
aren't two at all; they're connected at the waist, moving in strange
tandem. Another pair follow behind them, same as the first, same hair, same
eyes and the same potato-sack gait.

I look at
Charlotte, ticking off a PDA as each box of equipment is hoisted onto a
truck. Her hair pulled back in a severe bun and wearing a sea-foam
sarong, this whole scene could be recycled from ancient Egypt; 
Nefertiti supervising a grand public works, if Nefertiti were a middle-aged
Chinese-American with Sapphic lover who happened to be your mother. 
There's Mom, wearing a white Flash Gordon sari, and after Labor Day, no
less. 

Hi, Mom. 

Charlotte sees me first and she's not happy at all. Mom
sees me next, her face the accumulation of years between us, her
emotional floodgates opening in a way they never quite did for
Charlotte. 

Mom rushes up to me. Her tears staining the white of her
sari, me blinking my own away as the two of us have our own emotional
episode right here in front of the middle-aged space honeys, my agent, a
gendercidal feminist cult leader, circus side-show Doublmint girls, and
Alex. Oh yes, there he is, coming out of the main building, holding that
same goddamn gun. 

Mom saying, "Oh my God..." 

Charlotte smiling at me,
one eyebrow arched just so. 

Charlotte Wang, knowing how to tie up all loose ends. 

Then Alex, coming down the stairs, the space honeys watching
him; but do any have that twinge of maternal attachment? The conjoined
twins watching him, Charlotte, and Mom, watching him. 

There's Mom with
tears in her eyes, looking from Alex to me. Alex, close up in the sun,
suddenly not looking <b><i>like</i></b> Alex, looking <b><i>exactly</i></b> like Alex.  The two of
us don't look like father and son. Alex and I look like unevenly-aged
identical twins. Alex approaches Mom, standing in front of her
protectively, and points the gun at me. Like I could be more shocked
here, Alex? 

Charlotte Wang, really knowing everything. Alex pulling back
the hammer on the gun, pleading, "Mom, you said I was special, Mom? But
you lied." 

All those nights in Charlotte's lab, those blood tests. Of
course he looks just like Alex. Of course he looks just like me.
Franchise yourself. Make enough copies and the original doesn't have to
hurt so much. His eyes, my eyes, are full again with tears, clearly he
cannot grasp what's really going on. He's probably got the memory of a
goldfish in there. Degraded like an MP3 passed round too many times, he
just can't work it out. Mom tries to console him, but he shakes his
head, tears flying off like a wet dog trying to dry itself. Then his
eyes click back on me. 

And bang. 

Down I go. 

What you'd see if you were
Geraldine, or Charlotte, if you weren't right in front, is the bullet go
right through me and a micro-Hiroshima of blood burst out my back.  Then
you'd see me just stand there for a second, dumbfounded. My feet
collapse, then the knees, then rest of me, the accordion let down as the
whole existential scaffolding just gives up.  

This pen, out of ink. 

This
program, crashing. 

Right before I pass out, right before Alex is going
to finish me off, I see Mom screaming, the big cavern of her yell from
three decades past suddenly resurrected. Charlotte's realizing she lost
Mom, right here in the frozen pause of that replayed scream as Geraldine
reaches into her purse and Maces Alex, full load. The entire chemical
right in his face, before I can tell her, really, don't bother, please,
not on my account.

The rest you saw. Or read. Or heard. Like any story, like any good virus, it's everywhere now.

On the internet.

In the movie.

In the book.

In the opening monologue.

Wherever.

The crazy matriarchal cult that shot that writer, the writer who wrote
those kid's books. It's franchised everywhere. It's copied into
everyone's head. It's everybody's story, which maybe means it doesn't
have to be mine. 

You know how Mom had to leave Charlotte, to help me
recover from the gunshot, how Charlotte just disappeared along with all
the space honeys. If you saw the movie, Mom was Frances McDormand,
Charlotte was Joan Chen. They're both too young.  

You were aware of all
the hype, Alex being arrested, but the government being more interested
in his genetic history than his predilection for shooting writers. Then
the whole thing sort of went away. Certain biotech firms made a bunch of
patents, stocks shot up, maybe you made a bunch of money. 

Then you heard
about all the girl babies. 

It didn't seem like anything at first, an
anomaly, but pretty soon doctors started to figure out there were just
too many female babies being born. The odds were astronomical. There
were investigations as more little girls were being born and more little
boys were not. Then you heard about the virus, the modified STD, the one
that was piggybacking on all those Y chromosomes, getting them drunk,
filling their heads with distractions and booze right before the big
game. You know, right before it's time to come out and perform, to make
a man, all those Y chromosomes laying down on the job, just not
bothering to make boys. 

Then it got worse. You watched as more girls and
fewer and fewer boys were born. By that time, Mom, Alex and I were
already gone. At some point, you probably said to yourself, damn, damn
that Charlotte Wang. We try and keep low these days, but it's hard. I've
enough money in royalties and license fees from Geraldine, shuttled to
accounts that I can afford to keep us in this quiet, out of the way
spot. A sliver of beach, a square of tropical sky, and the rest of my
life a tangle with my soul-mate Alex, my self.  Call it the Cain and
Abel of the 21st century. Too bad he's a little poorly coded in the DNA
department.  

Mom says Charlotte worked out a way to make girl babies
from two eggs, no sperm need apply. My kind is reaching the end of its
product life cycle; there's been a planet wide recall on the series,
courtesy of Charlotte Wang. That's OK, it wasn't like they were doing
anything new with the brand. It was long overdue. 

At night, in a hot
tropical room, Mom and Alex out along the shore, I sit in the sweat of
beach evenings and picture orange groves, fields of bright crops growing
over a planet under an endless string of blue days. In the orchards,
flitting between the trees, I can hear the lilting voices of girls,
followed by the flitting glimpses of their perfect, naked little forms,
right before they smile at me and wave goodbye.
