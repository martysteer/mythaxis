[*BLURB] A belated welcome to the June 2011 edition of Mythaxis. 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop> Most publishers seem to produce the June
edition in the middle of May. Breaking with tradition, we are publishing
the June edition in early July. We have been running since February
2008, which is quite a long time for a Webzine.  I like to think we are
now comfortably established, but we can never have too many readers, so
keep Tweeting and Facebooking about us.

I'd also like to draw to your attention the <a
href="authors.htm">Authors' Links</a> page, giving the sites of some of
our authors.

In this edition, we have two more sparkling tales from Les Sklaroff,
a cyberpunk game within a game from Martin Clark, a fantasy reminiscence
from Matthew Kirshenblatt, a post-apocalypse from Twilite Minotaur, a
modest offering from your editor, and a haunting far-future vision from
Annabel Banks.

And, of course, another cartoon from Liam Baldwin.

[*BLURB] A non-Damascene conversion?
 

[*DESCRIPTION]  <p class=drop>I was threading my way back to the
reserved table when a familiar voice distinguished itself from the
general hubbub.   "... a whole new level of capability" it was saying in
that well-polished, softly accented Central European English.
"Groundbreaking stuff,"  it added, with a satisfying throaty roll of
each 'r'.  Then followed the mischievous giggle I remembered from his
'eccentric boffin' days, before he shunned publicity, when he used to
keep young television viewers enrapt with his lectures and
demonstrations, and which undoubtedly inspired the scientific interests
of at least two generations.  

<div class=pullquote>Not as vociferous as Dawkins</div>
I didn't have the temerity to intrude, but paused nearby long enough to
overhear a little more.  "...effectively making explosives redundant..."
he was saying.  "and we can all testify that it could not have been
achieved without faith."  I could hear cries of assent from his
colleagues.

In a state of some excitement I rejoined my friends.  "Guess who's
sitting at the table behind that pillar?" I demanded, in what I
contrived to make a discreet whisper, pointing surreptitiously through
my left shoulder.  Before they had time to consider, I told them.  "It's
Max Vorlek!"    The response was not encouraging.  "Vor-lek!" I
enunciated carefully.  I spread the fingers of my left hand and began
tallying.  "Cloud-fountains, the paramagnetic battery, compound
polytopes."   I continued to be met with faintly puzzled stares.  I was
undaunted.  "Latticed carbothenes,  multiphasic resonance-dampers."  I
had temporarily run out of fingers.  "The Boojum Hypothesis," I reminded
them, sitting back smugly.  

Light began to dawn.  "Oh, that inventor
chap..." 

"Didn't he refuse some award...?" 

"I thought he was dead."


"Wasn't he on 'The Muppet Show'?" 

"Oh yes, the one with that weird
theory..."

"He's a one-man innovation factory." I said.  "A practical engineer with
an amazing grasp of different areas of scientific knowledge, and more
original ideas to his credit than Edison or Tesla or even Bucky Fuller.
Of course, with every new idea he proposed, the scientific establishment
largely turned a deaf ear, or tried to discredit him.  Anyway, he's
obviously on to something new."  I told them what I had overheard,
adding, "What really surprised me was that reference to faith.  He's
always been a staunch atheist - not as vociferous as Dawkins, maybe, but
certainly opposed to anything remotely supernatural."  We agreed it was
curious, and speculated on the psychology of sudden conversion, and on
the possible nature of Vorlek's new discovery.  Then our food arrived,
and we became too preoccupied even to notice when Vorlek and his
companions had left.

<p class=drop>Two weeks later the world's attention was suddenly drawn to Bolivia,
where a section of the Andes, specifically one of the lesser peaks of
the Cordillera Real, the Peque&ntilde;o Alpamayo, had temporarily vanished.
Not obscured by cloud, but cleanly sheared off.  Temporarily, because
the entire mass was restored after four hours and nineteen minutes,
having spent that period of time resting neatly over the southern border
in the Atacama desert.  Satellite images confirmed the bizarre reality
of this event, corroborated by seismographical and gravimetric readings.

The culprit, as we learned soon enough, was Max Vorlek.  He had not, at
it happened, undergone a religious conversion, but he had conceived of,
designed, and with the help of a dedicated team, developed a
teleportation device which would literally change the world.  He called
it, somewhat grandly, a 'field-activated ion translocation hypertool',
but it became better known by its acronym.  

And yes, it could move
mountains.

[*BLURB] Extractions can prove painful.
 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Close your eyes and wait for the world to begin…</P>

<P>We were to meet up at <I>The Inverted Spin</I>, a fly-boy bar and
diner near Henderson Field. I have a patch that allows me to skip titles
and intro, getting me there well ahead of the other players. Despite it
being fairly busy the big corner booth is always empty, so I scored a
beer and settled in to see who else turned up.</P>

<P><div class=pullquote>The <I>Shadow Corporation</I> immersion game I
knew featured murder, torture, gun battles and betrayal.</div>I’d played
the
earlier version of <I>Shadow Corporation</I> and
nothing much seemed to have changed; same bar staff, same customers,
same d&eacute;cor. I felt slightly smug, as knowing the plot twists
would give me a decided advantage over the other players. That might
sound a bit petty but I enjoy watching how newbies react to virtual
environments most definitely designed with malice aforethought.</P>

<P>A man appeared at the booth, as if coming from the restrooms. It was
Vaughn, in full blown Christopher Lambert mode, circa. <I>Highlander</I>;
long rain coat, stubble, Japanese wakizashi short sword hanging under
his left armpit. </P>

<P>He sat opposite and smiled. &quot;Duncan. It’s been a
while.&quot;</P>

<P>I saluted him with my beer bottle. &quot;Vaughn. Haven’t seen you
since, what, <I>Scimitar of Symmetry?</I>&quot; We both looked at each
other for a moment, then laughed. I beat him to it. &quot;Fiona
Blair!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;God, <I>yes!</I> She almost made the whole thing worthwhile.
You still in contact with her?&quot;</P>

<P>I shrugged. &quot;Made the mistake of scoping her in real life. Let’s
just say that she didn’t quite live up to her gaming persona.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ouch. Well, you should have known better than to try and mix
the two. What goes on spool…&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stays on spool. Yeah, yeah, I know, but I’m an optimistic kind
of guy.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn motioned to the waitress for a beer. &quot;Not in here. Aren’t
you supposed to be the moody ex-fighter pilot with a dark secret?
Brooding, cynical, but who comes back for the survivors instead of
flying off to safety?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you, the stone killer with a conscience? The former
corporate assassin turned mercenary who goes up against the end of
chapter bad guys?&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;One of two in this edition. Apparently someone is holding my
daughter hostage to ensure my co-operation.&quot;</P>

<P>I grinned. &quot;Not exactly a case of art imitating life, I grant
you. To be honest, Vaughn, I didn’t see this being your kind of thing.
No guaranteed sexual encounters, for a start.&quot;</P>

<P>He took a swig of beer. &quot;Well, I’m always open to new
experiences, and- &quot;</P>

<P>Movement at the door caught my eye and I cut across him. &quot;Aw,
<I>crap</I>, it’s Ramirez. Did you know he was in on this?&quot;   </P>

<P>Vaughn shook his head. &quot;Unfortunate coincidence. Try and play
nice, Duncan, at least until we can get the scenario to kill him
off.&quot;</P>

<P>Ramirez rolled over to us, a big grin on his fat face. Despite the
leather flying jacket and aviator shades slipping down his nose, no one
would have mistaken him for a pilot, or even cabin crew. He was one of
those guys who seem congenitally unable to take the hint.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi, guys! This is just great. I’d no idea you two would be here
- the old gang, the three musketeers.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn muttered under his breath, &quot;More like the three amigos,
at this rate.&quot;</P>

<P>I tried not to laugh and shifted up as Ramirez squeezed his sweaty
bulk between bench and table. For all his faults, we needed him, at least
early on. His persona would be that of a fixer; he knew someone who knew
someone who could get us anything the unfolding narrative demanded. So I
tried to play nice.</P>

<P>&quot;No body morphing, Ramirez? You look pretty much as you do on
your player profile.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Naw! They were wanting so much extra for that, it was just
criminal. Apparently compensating charges are really steep with the new
interface. Physical dissonance they call it<I>. I</I> call it-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Looks like one of us at the door. Make that two, both
women.&quot;</P>

<P>Even Vaughn leaned round to take a look. The first woman was a curvy
brunette with close-cropped dark hair and eye-mask makeup. She was
wearing a throat-high one piece of iridescent metallic scales that
shimmered when she walked. The second newcomer couldn’t have been more
different. She looked like she’d tumbled down the rabbit hole from Alice
in Wonderland, complete with head band. </P>

<P>They walked over to us, being studiously ignored by the other
customers, and the brunette spoke. &quot;I’m Mazy, and this here is
Blondie.&quot; She rolled her eyes, &quot;Seriously.&quot;</P>

<P>I arched an eyebrow. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</P>

<P>The almost-Alice nodded. &quot;Oh yeah. I’m a big fan. The new
virtual tour is just <I>amazing</I>, and I’ve been to seven gigs so
far.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you’re here because?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t you know? Well, <I>apparently</I>, the head of corporate
security is modelled on Debbie herself, a full body and persona
licensing deal. So I just <I>had</I> to try this out, even though my
friend Helena says it’s a bit scary.&quot;</P>

<P>A bit scary? The <I>Shadow Corporation</I> immersion game I knew
featured murder, torture, gun battles and betrayal. Unless this new
edition had suddenly gone all fluffy-wuffy, Blondie was in for a really
bad trip.</P>

<P>Mazy looked us over. &quot;Fixer, pilot, killer – same as me. Blondie
is the hacker. We’re still missing the roguish bad-boy.&quot;</P>

<P>Ramirez pointed behind her. &quot;That looks like him now.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked over and hung my head, sighing, eyes closed. The new arrival
was kitted out like Han Solo, minus the gun on his hip as the scenario
didn’t allow for overt weaponry. Just in case we didn’t get the iconic
reference he’d added a shoulder bag and beat-up floppy hat. I just knew
his name would be ‘Harrison’ – an &uuml;ber fan boy.</P>

<P>As he walked over I felt a tangible change in the bar. The narrative
was moving out of a holding pattern into something more directional, and
Vaughn smiled. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe its
showtime.&quot;</P>

<P>The last of our group was, indeed, called Harrison, but I tuned out
while Ramirez made the introductions. My attention was on the door,
knowing there was an outside chance of a corporate security raid rather
than our scenario contact showing up. The game sometimes stiffed
experienced players with this hit-squad bullshit to keep us on our toes.
We’d be forced to split up, scatter, and piece together the plot rather
than having it laid out for us. </P>

<P class=drop>A group of three men entered and I relaxed. Two of them
were just
bodyguards, all impassive muscle, but the third was a showboat; white
linen suit, black shirt, black tie, cashmere coat draped over his
shoulders, greased-back curly hair and shades. This type of non-player
character I knew well, although the name kept changing.</P>

<P>Harrison had just gotten through the round of ‘Hellos’ and sat down
by the time our contact eased over. Mr Smooth gave us a brilliant smile,
complete with gold tooth. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Juan Canasta,
entrepreneur, middleman and renowned lover. May I join you?&quot;</P>

<P>We murmured our acceptance and Canasta handed his coat to one
bodyguard, sitting down on the chair held out by another.  He removed
his glasses and slid them into his breast pocket while a waitress placed
a glass of mineral water in front of him. With his saturnine good looks
he resembled a comedy devil in corporate mode, although I knew if we
reached the end game there wouldn’t be a lot of laughs.</P>

<P>Canasta placed an acoustic muffler on the table and background noise
dropped to almost zero. &quot;It’s always best to ensure some degree of
privacy in these matters, yes? Well, ladies and gentlemen, I asked my
close personal friend and business associate, Madam Tisa, to assemble a
team at short notice, and I can see she’s done me proud. I promise you
this will prove extremely lucrative, but it will not be without
risk.&quot;</P>

<P>I didn’t know Madam Tisa, obviously part of the introduction
sequence, but I could pretty much imagine the scene-setting spiel.
Blondie started, on the receiving end of a narrative prod. &quot;So, Mr
Canasta, what’s the deal?&quot;</P>

<P>He smiled in a way that was already beginning to irritate me.
&quot;Well, I represent certain interested parties, who of course wish
to remain nameless. For some time they have been working to ensure the
defection of a high-ranking executive from one of their
competitors.&quot;</P>

<P>There was another narrative feed-line, this time from Ramirez.
&quot;Come on, Canasta, who’s the target? We need to know what we’re
getting in to.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The executive in question is Jules Toba, the number three
at…Sensei Industries.&quot;</P>

<P>I smiled to myself at the momentary hesitation. It was the game
incorporating our personal character preferences into the narrative –
namely Vaughn’s choice of a sword over a firearm. Because of this I
suspected we’d come up against neo-Samurai at some point, or even
corporate ninja. </P>

<P>Mazy was talking, sounding sceptical. &quot;Jules Toba? He’s pretty
much the face of Sensei in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, yeah? He rarely
sets foot outside the corporate arcology, so what’s he doing way out
here?&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta shrugged. &quot;Toba engineered the need for a high-level
conference, one which couldn’t be conducted via a virtual interface. The
plan was for his private jet to develop engine trouble, such that it put
down at Darwin Hub, where an extraction team headed by Turner is
waiting.&quot;  A flicker of annoyance passed over his features and he
took a sip of mineral water before continuing. &quot;Unfortunately, the
sabotage proved to be all too effective and his aircraft could only make
it as far as here, Henderson Field. A spot where neither Sensei nor my
temporary employers have a corporate presence.&quot;</P>

<P>I could feel the prompt forming in my mind, a bit like an itch you
had to scratch, and moved to pre-empt it. &quot;So you need an
improvised team to spirit him away. Well, forgive me being so blunt, but
won’t his security be a trigger-happy suicide squad? I don’t fancy going
down in the proverbial hail of gunfire.&quot;</P>

<P>Our potential patron smiled, again. &quot;Sensei decided to keep his
presence here low-key. Obviously security will be on the increase, but
in an unobtrusive manner so as not to alert their commercial rivals. On
landing here Toba and his personal bodyguard were passed off as flight
engineers, part of a test crew, although this deception will not last
for long.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn scratched his nose, almost grinning, so I guessed he’d read
the recent game reviews, complete with spoilers. &quot;Oh, and why not?
What’s happened to blow his cover?&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta sighed. &quot;Sensei made the mistake of booking them into a
better hotel than their pay grade would warrant. Corporate expert
systems are constantly trawling the data stream for anomalies like that,
so it’s only a matter of time before his true identity leaks
out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So, what you’re saying is that not only do we have to get Toba
out before his own security congeals around him like amber, we can also
expect to run across other snatch squads as well?&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta sat back and
inspected the fingernails on his right hand, not
looking Vaughn in the face. &quot;Well, no one said this would be easy,
and I think you’ll find the financial pay-off will be commensurate with
the risk. Look, all you have to do is get in, get out and deliver him to
Hangar twelve where an orbital shuttle will be waiting. The original
extraction team will ensure that attention remains focussed on Darwin
Hub. Any rumour of Toba being <I>here</I> will look like disinformation,
and any opposition you might encounter won’t be first-team
quality.&quot;</P>

<P>I took a swig of beer. &quot;So what’s the catch, Canasta? I can just
hear a real big ‘but’ coming at the end of that spiel.&quot;</P>

<P>He glowered at me, letting the mask of good humour slip.
&quot;<I>But</I>, Toba doesn’t know you’re coming, and he’s expecting
Turner in person. As a result he may prove somewhat reluctant to
accompany you.&quot;</P>

<P>Blondie looked at him, wide-eyed. &quot;And what about Deb…the head
of his security detail? Do you know if she’s here yet?&quot; </P>

<P>Canasta paused before replying, as his persona tried to make sense of
the question in light of the narrative. &quot;His personal bodyguard is
James Graham, a former police officer with extensive experience of close
protection operations. I don’t have any details on who will head up the
extra security that Sensei are sending in. Do you know something I
don’t?&quot;</P>

<P>Blondie floundered and I knew that the scenario would come down hard
on any sign of inside information. We didn’t need that kind of grief as
the mission was going to be hard enough anyway. So I gave Canasta my
best open smile and let bullshit commence.</P>

<P>&quot;I’d say that was just deduction, Canasta. Sensei don’t want to
give the game away so they’ll be bringing in extra bodies in the guise
of ground crew, passengers, anything that won’t appear too obvious. The
corporate mindset is geared up to expect a hard-nosed guy as security
chief, so using a woman would be a smart move, a way to wrong-foot the
opposition. She’ll probably prove more deadly than the male,
but that’s our problem.&quot;</P>

<P>He sat back and I could feel that 'end of chapter' edge to
proceedings. &quot;So you’ll take the job?&quot;</P>

<P>We looked at each other, if only because the moment demanded it, and
Vaughn raised his bottle in a toast. &quot;Easy in, easy out.&quot;</P>

<P>We agreed some outrageous sum to be paid into a variety of off-shore
accounts, and Canasta left. The money wasn’t real, although it did give
your virtual persona prestige points, but it was the experience itself
that most players wanted. After exchanging mobile phone numbers I
prompted the group to split up, knowing that to hang around meant
getting caught up in a bar fight, and I wasn’t in the mood.</P>

<P class=drop>The <I>Inverted Spin</I> was part of a high-tech shanty
town that had
grown up outside the orbital hub, away from the corporate enclaves. The
irritating thing was we’d spend several hours lurking in the backstreets
while Ramirez did his thing – arranging ground transport, a safe house,
weapons
– while all the time I knew Toba was less than a mile away. </P>

<P>Ramirez needed muscle to back some of his face-to-face transactions
and Vaughn let Mazy take the lead, preferring to kick back and just
chill. I was looking to relax as well - my skills as a pilot wouldn’t be
called upon until much later. The two of us sat on the veranda of a
nearby caf&eacute;, although the heat and humidity was a level of
virtual reality I could well have done without.</P>

<P><div class=pullquote>In a standard game the experience was lifelike
but you always knew you were in a virtual reality environment</div>I was
expecting a more-or-less pleasant hiatus until my personal
‘confront your past’ sub-plot kicked in – the one which explained my
bitter, twisted attitude. However, as soon as the others had vanished
into the crowd Vaughn was up and away, with me stepping out to catch up.
He was unusually grim faced and I expected some explanation, but as we
continued walking in silence my patience gave out. &quot;So, Vaughn,
what gives?&quot;</P>

<P>He glanced at me. &quot;We both know the Sensei crew are holed up in
the Holiday Lodge. It’s a classier setup than the Ascension Hotel and
the only option given what Canasta laid out for us.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah? So what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, how about we walk in there, walk right up to the desk and
ask to speak to Jules Toba. Just take it from there.&quot;</P>

<P>I pulled up. &quot;Whoa there, Vaughn. You can’t just bounce straight
to the extraction stage. You push the game and it’ll push
back.&quot;</P>

<P>He kept walking and again I had to hurry to catch up, trying not to
sound irritated. &quot;Come on, Vaughn, what is this? Look, Ramirez does
his stuff and Blondie gets us the hotel layout, hacks their security
system. Then you, Mazy and Harrison go in while the rest of us wait
outside with the engine running.&quot;</P>

<P>He snorted with derision. &quot;You don’t find that all a bit
convoluted? A bit contrived? Your problem is you think you know what’s
going on, because you’ve played the earlier version. The others, even
fat boy, will roll with the punches but <I>this</I> game is going to
blindside you, man, big time.&quot;</P>

<P>I frowned and pulled him up, a hand on his shoulder. &quot;OK, so
maybe I skipped the introduction and briefing stages, but this, going
charging straight in there, is well out of order. Or do you really know
something I don’t?&quot;</P>

<P>He gave me a short smile, barely a twitch of his lips, and shrugged
off my hand. &quot;Let’s just say I’m not quite the character you think
I am, and leave it at that. Now, are you coming or not?&quot;</P>

<P>Before I could speak another voice answered. &quot;I’ll tag along,
even if he won’t.&quot; Harrison stepped out from between two small vans
parked at the roadside. His character was a jack of all trades, there to
step in should one of the principals drop out. As
such it wasn’t a popular choice, frequently being left as a non-player
persona under game control – and the first to take a bullet if the bad
guys got the drop on us. </P>

<P>I looked between Harrison and Vaughn, getting the distinct feeling I
was missing something. &quot;Look, Harrison, shouldn’t you be hanging
with Ramirez and Mazy? Or at least babysitting Blondie? If anyone screws
up we’re counting on you to take up the slack.&quot;</P>

<P>He removed his hat and wiped sweat from the head band. &quot;That’s a
bit predictable, if you don’t mind me saying. The longer we hang about
the tougher it’s gonna be to reach Toba, so I think Vaughn
here has a point. We go knock on his door and see if he
answers.&quot;</P>

<P>This casual flaunting of scenario protocols was starting to make me
nervous. &quot;Look guys, even if by some miracle we pull this off,
we’re cutting three players out of the action. If nothing else that’s
gonna <I>seriously</I> hurt our game rankings. Nobody likes a dickhead
who messes things up for everyone else.&quot;</P>

<P>Harrison laughed. &quot;<I>Told</I> you he was a bit pedestrian,
Vaughn. You still say he’s worth having around?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Duncan is solid. He just needs time to adjust
to the new UR paradigm shift.&quot;</P>

<P>I wasn’t a great fan of Ultra-Realism, but I’d gone with the
interface upgrade as I’m a bit of a techno-nerd at heart. Whereas
existing games were more real than real in terms of the simulated
sensory input hitting your brain, the new versions from
Second&nbsp;Reality&#8482; made me decidedly uncomfortable. </P>

<P>In a standard game the experience was lifelike but you always
<I>knew</I> you were in a virtual reality environment. For example:
coffee tasted like coffee, things didn’t break down unless they were
supposed to, it didn’t rain on your parade. UR was far more subtle, it
was all about nuances, both physical and psychological. Now the coffee
might taste like crap, a button might come off your jacket, you might
get a toothache. It was really hard to tell you were in a UR
environment, and that’s what many industry commentators found
unsettling. However, I could see this particular ‘full sensory immersion
experience’ going down the toilet in short order.</P>

<P>&quot;Look, guys, what do you hope to achieve? It doesn’t matter how
flexible the scenario may be, you simply can’t play this fast and loose
with the narrative and expect to get away scot-free.&quot;</P>

<P>The two of them exchanged glances and, again, I felt like an
outsider. Vaughn opened his coat, exposing the wakizashi hanging under
there. &quot;Take a look at my sword, Duncan. A real close look, at the
very end of the hilt.&quot;</P>

<P>Curious, I stepped closer and tilted it towards me. &quot;Well,
there’s a symbol-&quot;</P>

<P>Fade to grey.</P>

<P class=drop>It lasted a moment, an eternity, or something in-between.
A
featureless limbo, with not even darkness to feed my imagination. There
was no up, no down, no sense of physical presence – I was just a
disembodied point of view, with nothing to see.</P>

<P>The street returned on a tidal wave of sensory overload and I stepped
back, hunched over against the onslaught, unable to speak. Vaughn let
his coat fall back into place, covering the sword. There was concern in
Harrison’s voice but I didn’t think it was for my condition. &quot;Best
get him off the street, we’re attracting attention.&quot;</P>

<P>They guided me into a narrow alley and I stood with my back against
the wall, eyes screwed shut, fingers in my ears. My surroundings were
still too loud, too pungent, too bright.</P>

<P>&quot;What you do to him, Vaughn? The guy is totally wired.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Duncan has the same Sensorium interface that most established
AIs use – their window on our world, if you like. When mediaCore
announced they were adapting it for use in the gaming community he
decided to get in on the ground level. Beta release wetware, extensive
neural hardwiring, the whole nine yards. Then, of course, along came
Enhanced Reality which left its competitors dead in the water. It became
the de facto gaming standard and he was forced to tack on another layer
of proprietary hardware, as did all serious players.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So your boy is wandering around in the real world with a head
full of obsolete technology. Big deal. How did that allow you to work
your mojo on him <I>in here</I>?&quot;</P>

<P>I could hear something in Vaughn’s voice; not satisfaction exactly,
more a sense of relief. &quot;AIs play games, AIs
play a <I>lot</I> of games. For some, it’s the only time they get let out
of the box. So they have the ER, and now UR, interface as well. This
symbol on my sword hilt is a glyph, an interface command
trigger.&quot;</P>

<P>Harrison was beginning to sound irritated. &quot;In English?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It activates the old Sensorium interface, which this game
environment doesn’t support. It’s like switching to a dead TV channel –
there’s no signal, only static.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And this helps us how, exactly?&quot;</P>

<P>Cooking smells reached my nose and my stomach turned over; I turned
away and threw up. Harrison laughed. &quot;Jesus, Vaughn! Your boy is
dying out here.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn put his hand on my shoulder and the pressure made my shirt
feel like sandpaper. &quot;Easy there, Duncan, it’s just the shock of a
sensory reboot. Try and concentrate on your own body to start with … And
to answer your question, Harrison, this little gizmo, incorporated into
my sword, means that if I stick an AI player it’ll force a log out. That
way we avoid any so-called last gasp retaliation and the character
lapses into a non-player persona. That is, a dead person.&quot;</P>

<P>Harrison laughed again. &quot;Yeah, I get that. Those AIs sure make
sore losers. Couldn’t you just have <I>told</I> us though, as opposed to
putting bozo here through the wringer?&quot;</P>

<P>I spat and straightened up. &quot;Bastard! What the hell was all that
about?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn just shrugged with no hint of apology in his voice. &quot;Had
to see if it worked. I’ve learned that some of the principal characters
are likely to be AIs with genuine synthetic personalities, not just an
emotional overlay. Prime candidates for holding a grudge should we get a
bit creative.&quot;</P>

<P>I wasn’t pleased. &quot;Just the type to get vindictive, you mean!
And you still want us to go marching straight in there? Well, think
again.&quot;</P>

<P>Even Harrison was beginning to sound doubtful. &quot;Yeah, hold on
there, Vaughn. Your fancy blade might not be illegal, strictly speaking,
but you can bet the <I>game</I> AI won’t take kindly to one of his kind
being shown the door in short order. We don’t need any unnecessary grief
if you ask me.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shook his head. &quot;No, this new version is a true free-form
environment. As gamers we know where Toba will be, because we know the
original version, right? As characters we can use logical deduction to
explain away this knowledge, and the game won’t punish us for being
smart. I say we give it a go.&quot;</P>

<P>Harrison and I exchanged glances and I could tell he was swaying
towards the high risk strategy his devil-may-care persona always
favoured.  I trusted Vaughn, more or less, so there had to be something
behind his confidence, something he hadn’t shared as yet. I shrugged.
&quot;What’s the worst that can happen?&quot;</P>

<P>Harrison grinned. &quot;I’ll hang back while you two stick your heads
in the grinder, if you don’t mind. If it doesn’t work out I’ll break the
bad news to the others and we’ll go back to the original plan.&quot;</P>

<P>I snorted. &quot;You can pilot a shuttle? Handle a weapon?&quot;</P>

<P>He spread his hands. &quot;I’m pretty much a renaissance man when you
get down to it. I can do a whole <I>range</I> of things equally unwell.
But
enough to get by.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn just laughed and led us back onto the street. It wasn’t that
far to the hotel but I insisted we at least try and maximize our chances
before walking in there. The other two refused to change, so as front man
by default I swopped my jeans and vest for a lightweight business suit
and open-necked shirt. With the facial scars I looked like a corporate
enforcer and the tailor even threw in an eye patch for free.  </P>

<P>Whereas Harrison had roguish good looks and Vaughn went for brooding,
the man looking back at me from the full length mirror was just
<I>mean</I>. Not even with a hint of moody, but full-blown bad bastard.
They say chicks dig scars but mine verged on disfigurement, and women
attracted to me for my looks always turned out to be seriously damaged
personalities. I’d stopped modifying my appearance long before the new
UR interface started placing a premium on physical dissonance, but I
suspected most other players thought I looked this way for effect.</P>

<P>To round off my new look I went for diamond stud cufflinks and a pair
of matching gold thumb rings previously owned by a Brazilian
<I>capoeira</I> fighter. The game loved touches like that and I was sure
any AI player would pick up on it immediately. I figured the
anticipation of a fancy move might make an opponent hesitate, giving me
the chance to grab an improvised weapon or make a sharp exit.</P>

<P>When I came out Vaughn just shook his head and Harrison sniggered,
but I noticed that the pedestrians we encountered went out of their way
to give us a wide berth. Outside the Holiday Lodge we parted company;
Harrison took up residence under a bar umbrella across the street and
Vaughn waited outside in case someone objected to his esoteric dress
sense. He handed me an earpiece and I went inside. </P>

<P class=drop>The Holiday Lodge was a comparatively new building with a
nod towards
colonial chic; high ceilings, tiled floors, concrete trying to look like
marble. I walked across the wide reception-cum-lounge to the desk, where
an Indonesian dude gave me an insincere smile. &quot;Good afternoon,
sir. How may I help you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I understand you have a party from Sensei Industries staying
here at present. I’d like to speak to them.&quot;</P>

<P>There was a slight hesitation, but the game couldn’t just blank a
legitimate request. The receptionist lifted a handset. &quot;Certainly
sir, and who shall I say is calling?&quot;</P>

<P>A sudden idea came to me and I smiled. &quot;Jules Toba.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn laughed in my ear. <I>&quot;Jesus! Well, that should grab
their attention, and no mistake. What you got planned as an
encore?&quot;</P> </I> <P>There was a murmur of conversation on the
phone and then the receptionist looked up. &quot;There will be someone
to see you directly, Mr Toba. If you care to wait in the veranda bar,
I’ll inform our guests where you are.&quot; </P>

<P>I wandered through the wide arch into the bar, which opened out onto
the veranda via a set of folding doors. A climate barrier kept out most
of the heat and humidity so I flopped down on the upholstered bamboo
furniture to let things play out.</P>

<P>Vaughn mooched in and relaxed; arms wide across the back of the sofa,
legs stretched out, crossed at the ankles. I saw Harrison take a seat
outside, trying to remain inconspicuous. He’d swopped the hat and
waistcoat for improvised cravat and shades, but still had his shoulder
bag to hand. We ordered a bottle of beer for Vaughn and a tonic water
for me. And waited. </P>

<P>&quot;Do you actually have a plan, Vaughn, or is this all just
wishful thinking?&quot;</P>

<P>He smiled. &quot;Wishful thinking? I’d prefer to think of it as an
insightful analysis of the game paradigms. Or just winging it, your
choice… You armed, by the way?</P>

<P>&quot;Me? My character has a pathological aversion to firearms
following my wife’s suicide using my service revolver. I was supposed to
run into an old girlfriend and save her from a mugging, during which I’d
reconnect to my suppressed humanity and love of bang-sticks, but
<I>someone</I> has kind of truncated my day.&quot;  </P>

<P>Vaughn started to laugh but then his face went carefully neutral and
he gestured with the beer bottle. &quot;We’ve got company.&quot;</P>

<P>Three men entered from the lobby, two Japanese and one Caucasian, all
wearing short-sleeved shirts and flight crew uniform jackets. They wore
their jackets unbuttoned and the way the younger Japanese guy kept
tugging his shut over a bulge suggested firearms carried at the hip.
Professionals you can trust, but hastily armed civilians can be a right
pain in the butt. The best I could do was play it cool, professional,
and hope for inspiration. I stood and exchanged formal bows with the
older Japanese, who was wearing captain’s insignia. Vaughn remained
seated, a calculated insult, and I felt the tension rise. So much for
cool.  </P>

<P>&quot;I am Captain Marasaki, senior test pilot for Sensei Industries.
This is co-pilot Walker, flight engineer Sato. You are not Jules
Toba.&quot;</P>

<P>Marasaki was no more a test pilot than I was Coco the Clown. Real
test pilots are either dispassionate ice men or over-confident wild
animals with <I>cojones</I> the size of basketballs. This guy exuded a
sober calm based on years of experience, just the person you wanted
flying senior executives around the globe. </P>

<P>Before I could say anything Vaughn chipped in. &quot;No he’s not. But
we both know the real Jules Toba is here, and your enemies will soon
learn of this unless we act quickly.&quot;</P>

<P>Marasaki regarded him coldly. &quot;And you are?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn set down his beer and stood up. &quot;Vaughn Vermeer, and this
is Duncan Bonn. U verwachtte iemand, maar u verwachtte niet om ons te
zien, niet waar?"</P>

<P>That threw me completely but the pilot seemed to understand him well
enough. &quot;Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn nodded. &quot;Ja, maar gelieve verder te gaan in het
Engels.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As you wish, Mr Vermeer. You have something, perhaps, that you
wish to show me?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn held his coat open and I saw Marasaki scrutinise the sword.
The Captain gave a sharp nod and Vaughn closed his coat, looking
slightly smug. I really didn’t get this, to the point where I was
feeling embarrassed about my ignorance. Vaughn motioned to Harrison who
strode in, all easy grin, pocketing his sunglasses. He didn’t rate a
formal introduction but didn’t seem to mind. Captain Marasaki motioned
for us to accompany him. &quot;Please, gentlemen. If the situation is as
serious as you claim then speed is of the essence.&quot;</P>

<P>We moved in a mixed group back into the lobby and I sidled up to
Harrison, keeping my voice low. &quot;What’s this Dutch angle,
then?&quot;</P>

<P>He glanced at me, frowning. &quot;Dutch? You mean NuVOC? It’s who
Vaughn and I both worked for before he retired and I branched out into
private enterprise. Don’t you know <I>anything</I> about the new
background to this game?&quot;</P>

<P>I felt my face colour and tried to keep the tone flippant.
&quot;Maybe I skimmed the briefing notes a bit. Just say that today has
been a learning curve and leave it at that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Schmuck.&quot;</P>

<P>Couldn’t fault him there. </P>

<P>The front of the Holiday Lodge was a wide fa&ccedil;ade, housing
reception, a restaurant and the bar. The accommodation to the rear was a
series of bungalows around a central tree-filled courtyard. This
afforded shade, the pleasant background rustle of leaves and a degree of
privacy from the guests directly opposite. As we reached the long
right-hand path the flight crew stopped and Marasaki gestured for us to
continue.</P>

<P>&quot;Please, you are expected. And may fortune smile upon you,
gentlemen.&quot;</P>

<P>We walked on and I saw there was a woman waiting for us outside a
bungalow roughly half way along. Shoulder length blonde hair, pencil
skirt, blouse, heels, hand on hip.</P>

<P>It was Debbie Harry, it just <I>was</I>.</P>

<P>I’m not a fan of simulated celebrities in
games as they’re generally
there to distract you from shoddy gameplay. For the late, great, Ms
Harry, though – currently back in the charts and on virtual tour – well,
I was willing to make an exception.</P>

<P>She certainly looked the part, all detached cool circa ‘Def, Dumb,
&amp; Blonde’, with a calculating air that shaded her into queen bitch
territory. She didn’t appear armed but I got the distinct impression she
probably didn’t need anything as crass as a gun.</P>

<P>Vaughn walked straight up to her, slid an arm around her waist, and
kissed her. Kissed her for a long time. She didn’t melt into his arms
but, then again, she didn’t exactly fight him off either. Finally he
broke the clinch and wiped her lipstick from his face.</P>

<P>&quot;Debs, it’s been too long.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That will be <I>Miss</I> Harry, if you don’t mind.&quot;</P>

<P>She gave him a half smile, though, and he winked. &quot;In
here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes. Go right in, you’re expected.&quot;</P>

<P>I followed Vaughn into the bungalow, trying not to catch her eye. The
blinds were drawn and it took a moment for my eyes to adjust from the
outside glare. There was a man sitting at the desk off to the right,
reading. He was of average build, pretty nondescript, and seemingly
unconcerned by our presence. I heard the door close behind me. I heard
the sound of a gun being cocked.</P>

<P class=drop>The Second&nbsp;Reality&#8482; slogan is ‘Your life, only
different’,
and that’s the
attraction. You bring yourself to the game and in return it immerses you
in an alternative lifestyle. So when I heard that slick metallic
<I>click</I> my first thought was ‘Oh shit’, not ‘I’m out of here’.
Vaughn and I both raised our hands, unbidden, and I slowly turned back
towards the door. I was expecting it to be Harrison, tag-along Harrison,
on some betrayal sub-plot.</P>

<P><div class=lpullquote>If you’ve played as many games as I have, you
start to get a sense of a twist coming.</div> Instead I found he was
also standing, hands raised, with an automatic
pistol pressed against the side of his head. The gunman was tall, with
short grey hair and goatee, expensive suit, hard-faced. He’d been hiding
behind the door, which was just too obvious to be true, but had paid off
handsomely. He had a Scots accent.</P>

<P>&quot;In this room I have sole responsibility for the safety of Mr
Toba. You have five seconds to explain your presence here and I don’t
count out loud.&quot;</P>

<P>I saw Harrison relax and expected Vaughn to launch into another
incomprehensible spiel, or display that damn sword, or do whatever was
required to make us all best buddies.  But there was nothing apart from
the sound of a heavy-bladed ceiling fan above us. </P>

<P>Harrison cleared his throat. &quot;Vaughn? Hey, Vaughn…&quot;</P>

<P>The game went slo-mo.</P>
<P>The muzzle flash, starshell bright in the gloom.</P>
<P>The jolt of the head, jaw slack and eyes white.</P>
<P>The exit wound arc of blood, bone and brain matter.</P>
<P>The tumbling glitter of an ejected shell casing.</P>
<P>All underscored by the low, drawn-out roar of a large caliber gunshot.</P>

<P>Real-time returned, with the bright tinkle of brass on tile. Harrison
toppled sideways to sprawl on the floor, blood pooling under his
head.</P>

<P>Blood ran down the gunman’s cheek.</P>
<P>Blood ran down the gunman’s cheek from his ruined left eye.</P>

<P>I turned my head and saw Vaughn was holding a derringer; a small
weapon, little more than a toy. One of those comedy guns that slide out
from your cuff, but nobody was laughing. I looked back. The gunman
swayed but stayed upright, pistol turning towards us. I heard a tinny
<I>bang</I> from behind me and his right eye seemed to collapse in on
itself, like those old style retractable headlights. The swinging arm
became a pirouette, became a twisting tumble to the floor, on his back,
gun still clenched tight. I laughed, a nervous outburst devoid of any
humour, and lowered my arms. </P>

<P>The man at the desk spoke; his voice was calm, mannered, with no hint
of concern. &quot;Now, that <I>is</I> unfortunate. Mr Graham was
exceptionally loyal, after his fashion.&quot;</P>

<P>I turned in time to see Vaughn flex his hand and make the derringer
vanish. He looked over. &quot;Jules Toba? I just like to be clear about
these things.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, it would be embarrassing if I turned out anyone else but,
yes, I’m Jules Toba. Should I bother to ask why you’re here or is this a
simple corporate assassination?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn smiled. &quot;I’m Vermeer, this is Bonn, and we’ve been hired
to facilitate your defection from Sensei Industries.&quot;</P>

<P>Toba arched one eyebrow. &quot;Really? And why do you think I would
so easily set aside a lifetime of devoted service?&quot;</P>

<P>I knew we didn’t have time for Toba to play coy, even though it was
obvious Miss Harry was working with Vaughn, and chipped in. &quot;Look,
Mr Toba, we know you were expecting Turner, but this is pretty much an
ad hoc operation and your best chance of making that long walk. How
about you just trust us and we all ride off into the sunset?&quot;</P>

<P>Even as I spoke I could feel the niggle in back of my mind. If you’ve
played as many games as I have, you start to get a sense of a twist
coming. Vaughn turned to me. &quot;It’s OK, Duncan, but I’m afraid Mr
Toba wasn’t planning on defecting.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There’s no defection, there never was. Oh, there will be enough
circumstantial evidence to make it <I>appear</I> as if he was planning
to switch employers, but its all just window dressing.&quot;</P>

<P>I glared at him. &quot;So what the hell are we doing here then?
Getting his autograph?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The plan was for the Sensei security team, headed by Miss
Harry, to be in place long before we mounted our extraction bid. They’d
been bribed to ensure that Mr Toba died in the crossfire – a tragic
accident. Harrison was also part of their operation, as insurance.&quot;
He turned to Toba, &quot;You appreciate, sir, the damage your death
would cause under these circumstances?&quot;</P>

<P>Toba nodded. &quot;Yes, quite. Even the suggestion of disloyalty
would cast a pall over my colleagues and call all recent decisions into
doubt. The blow to investor confidence would be severe. But how, may I
ask, are you privy to this information?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Miss Harry, sir, remained loyal. She contacted Anzai Sayoru,
the head of Sensei security. As they had no way of knowing who else
might be involved, it was decided to let the plot develop, but with
additional safeguards in place.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Meaning yourself, Mr Vermeer?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn inclined his head. &quot;Indeed. I am an agent of the New
Dutch East India Company, NuVOC. Officially I retired from active
service some years ago, but that’s more to do with deniability than any
real degree of severance. There is a long history of cooperation between
our respective employers and we were glad to be of assistance.&quot;</P>

<P>OK, I could get behind that. You can’t trust your own security so you
bring in some outside help. Not so much an extraction as rescue mission,
but I could see how the twist kept most of the scenario intact. Toba,
though, still wasn’t convinced. He tidied a few things on the desk and
casually lifted a pistol from the drawer. &quot;An intriguing scenario,
Mr Vermeer, I must admit. But one quite lacking in corroborative
evidence. All I have witnessed is that Miss Harry allowed you access to
this bungalow, and two violent deaths.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn gestured to his coat. &quot;May I?&quot;</P>

<P>Toba nodded and Vaughn drew his sword, holding it by tip and hilt. He
presented it for inspection, bowing his head as he did so.
&quot;Satisfied?&quot;</P>

<P>Toba lowered his gun. &quot;Quite. Now, as regards Miss Harry, I
suggest-&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn stabbed him, a twisting, inverted, one-handed blow straight to
the stomach, hilt deep. I choked with surprise, turned away and dropped
to my knees, scrabbling through Harrison’s bag to get the antique
revolver I knew he’d been carrying. </P>

<P>There was no need.</P>

<P>Toba stood there, immobile, the gun still hanging at his side. Vaughn
had backed off a little and I had a clear view of the injury he’d
inflicted. There was no blood, but around the entry point it looked like
the colour was leaching out of Toba’s clothes, leaving a spreading patch
of monochrome. I struggled to my feet, the revolver heavy in my
hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Vaughn? What the hell have you done, man?&quot;</P>

<P>He shrugged. &quot;I did what I had to. Now give me the gun, I’m
better with firearms than you are.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;But, but, <I>why</I>, for God’s sake? I was following
everything and then you go and slice him!&quot;</P>

<P>His shoulders drooped. &quot;I tried to tell you earlier. They really
are holding my daughter hostage. Now, give me the gun.&quot;</P>

<P>I was floundering, unable to get my thoughts straight, and took a
step back. &quot;Real world? The game? I don’t understand!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Duncan, <I>give me the damn gun!</I>&quot;</P>

<P>He grabbed for it and I fired, three times, hitting Vaughn twice in
the chest. He dropped to his knees, pink froth on his lips, and tried to
speak. All that came out was a burbling whisper.
<I>&quot;Lisbon.&quot;</P> </I> 

<P>Vaughn slumped backwards to the
floor, and was still. I know he wasn’t really dead, I know I didn’t
really kill him, but unless you were there you’ve no idea of the horror
I faced. Gun smoke, the smell of blood and bowels, the sight of blood
running between the floor tiles, the pounding of my heart. All in
glorious Ultra-Reality. I felt sick.</P>

<P>The door behind me opened and closed. I sensed someone at my shoulder
and the smell of jasmine reached my nostrils. &quot;Messy, but probably
necessary, if truth be told. That revolver is of no further use to you,
Duncan.&quot;</P>

<P>I let it clatter to the floor and blinked rapidly, my eyes moist.
Toba was turning black and white, skin as well as clothes, like an
illustration being coloured in, but in reverse.</P>

<P>&quot;What, what <I>is</I> that?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry tried to sound matter-of-fact, even slightly bored, but
there was an underlying edge of excitement to her voice. &quot;The sword
is an imported artifact, not supplied by me. Players do it all the time
with customised clothes, vehicles, especially weapons. This
<I>particular</I> weapon, this <I>particular</I> representation of
virtual code, contains a virus. One that can access its intended target
only though the obsolete Sensorium interface. As such, it’s harmless to
humans and doesn’t even register as a threat within the game.&quot;</P>

<P> &quot;You, you’re the game controller? But you can’t <I>do</I> this,
it’s not fair!&quot;</P>

<P>She gave me a real poster pose, all coquettish pout. &quot;What, a
girl can’t have fun these days? Anyway, as regards our stricken friend
over there, his real name is Cromarty. Well, that’s the corporation he
works for, but the two are frequently synonymous these days. Someone
went to a lot of trouble over this.&quot;</P>

<P>This wasn’t so much breaking the ‘fourth wall’ as installing a set of
sliding doors. I closed my eyes but there was still no ‘Exit Game’ icon,
no way home. There was a contemplative tone in her voice.</P>

<P>&quot;Let every voice be still.&quot;</P>

<P>I blinked, picking up something in her intonation. &quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It’s part of a poem by Holbein. <I>Let every voice be still,
save false witness to the end of days</I>. It’s a commentary on how
events can be redefined, restructured to suit a particular viewpoint,
particularly when there are no dissenting voices.&quot;</P>

<P>I felt cold. &quot;Dissenting voices? Like mine?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry laughed, sounding genuinely amused. &quot;Good grief, no!
You get to play the sole survivor of this little bloodbath, not me. Its
now part and parcel of the scenario and I’m just a compromised operative
on the run, a fellow traveler. In fact, we have to rejoin the remaining
players for the ‘all avenues closed’ endgame. It promises to be quite
exciting and I understand there’s someone desperately keen to make my
acquaintance…Time to go.&quot;</P>

<P>I hesitated, unable to tear my eyes away. &quot;This isn’t a game
any more, is it?&quot;</P>

<P>She patted my shoulder. &quot;It never was, Duncan. It never was.&quot;</P>

<P>

[*BLURB] A Desire Named Streetcar?
 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>I’m waiting at the bus stop again, though I
know I’m not going anywhere. <br>

It’s past midnight, and I am standing
outside in Thornhill. The pale
morning sky is just a memory as the dark blue night and its streetlamps
turn the crinkled autumn leaves and road into a light incandescent
purple. I feel the dark brown bulk of Thornhill Public School looming
over my head like ancient history, even as I stand beside the glass
walls of the bus shelter. It reminds me of where I came from … and
where, if I wasn’t careful, I could easily find myself coming back to.

And I hadn’t been careful.

So I’m standing here, at the York Region Transit stop, playing a very
long-standing game with myself. It is the game of how I recognize my old
elementary school from Grades 1-3 behind me. It is the game of looking
at the white and green painted Farmer’s Market in the plaza across the
street from me, and the purple Octagon restaurant off to the side. It is
knowing the rolling hills of Gallanough Park behind my old school, and
the location of Thornhill Secondary School -- of my high school -- just
a few blocks past the plaza across the street as you walk past the old
Masonic Temple on the left-hand side.

The object of this game is simple. I walk past the craft stores, and
apartments, and streets, and my old schools and hidden parks until I get
to the secluded St. Volodymyr’s Ukrainian Catholic Church; the space
dividing the cemeteries of St. Luke’s Catholic Church from the old
Thornhill Community’s; the nearby houses with their windows of
candlelight; to Markham and the purportedly haunted
white-planked Thornhill Village Library all the way back to this bus
stop where I
realize -- again -- that I’d barely even miss this place if
I went on a bus right now, at this moment, and never returned.

That is the game I’m playing right now.

And then I remember that it is past midnight and there is no bus
running this late, and that even if there were, it would be coming
from
Richmond Hill and moving past this stop to the glittering lights of the
real city of Toronto -- where it'd just stop at the Finch Station
terminal and I’d have to pay yet another fare to use the separate subway
system. In other words, it
leads to no uncharted places, nor any horizons to disappear to.

There’s no great mystery to vanish into.

So I walk away from the place where I wait for the bus that will never
come … from the place that I now know all too well. I stride forward and
cross the street to the sidewalk past the empty gas station, and I walk
across again to the other side of the darkened street.

I keep walking. Every time I walk here, in this region, I feel as though
I am enacting an age-old rote of walking - of mapping, and tracing, and
connecting the rural suburban streets and roads together with the
movement of my legs. I try to convince myself that it is all one great
rite of correspondence, place, space and time - that somewhere, somehow,
this all has meaning for me … that it will accomplish something …
something whose understanding is just inches away from my subconscious
mind.

I try, unsuccessfully, to figure out what this is and only the old
familiar hollowness remains. Instead, I spend most of my time trying not
to think about the shimmering lights of the city that I almost made it
to; the place I turned my back on, and all the things I learned there.
It too had been a lonely place - though its ghosts … its mistakes, are
far
more fresh than the old memories here that live in every piece of cement
and blade of grass.

No. The closest I’d ever gotten to the city, to the place I’d never
thought to escape to, to physically leaving this place was moving to
York University, and a piece of paper.

For all the two years that lasted.

Now, as I walk down the sloping sidewalk and cross another street, I
know that there was never an escape. Toronto’s vicarious promises were
merely a brief respite from Thornhill’s empty certainties.

No matter what happened, after everything I did,
and where I came from I
always knew that I was going to be back here.

<div class=pullquote>They glitter like trails of twilight, or streaks of
pale coloured chalk</div>I walk past the Starbucks plaza now; past more
craft stores, and the
Village Library with its ethereal night-dweller and her nocturnal
reading habits. That is one of the few thoughts that makes me smile now
-
to imagine that this ghost is quietly reading all the oldest and latest
books in the safety and warmth of the place she’s known for almost her
entire existence. It is a thought that makes me smile even as, for some
reason, it makes me sad.

I continue walking as the pavement becomes a railing opening up to a
grove of trees below on my right side. For a few brief moments, as short
as those two years were, I shone more brightly than I did my entire
short life. Just to have to return here. Just to return to slumber … and
restless sleepwalking.

I come to a stop in front of a white picket fence and a wide sloping
park. Thornhill is not a place of the present. It is a place of ghosts,
dogs, young families, old men, used books, and merely the memories of
present life.

And if you don’t leave it, it becomes the place you haunt while you are still alive.

Goosebumps flicker across my back. For the first time, I actually
realize that the moon is out. I look around me. Then I look behind me.
I’m standing in front of what looks like an old cottage. This is
Cricklewood Park - a long-established Women’s Golf
 course I’ve passed many times
with my Dad as we’ve driven to the movie theatre in Richmond Hill.
During the day, the little cottage or hut is a faded
turquoise with a painted thatched roof and a brown sign in
yellow-lettering that reads:

Stop 17.

<p class=drop>I’ve never exactly known what it was. I always assumed
that it was the
site of another golf course, or a storage shed. In fact, I’ve never
really thought much of it. But for some reason, tonight, I feel
compelled to stand right in front of it.

I’m standing off on the side of the road in front of Cricklewood Park. I
feel like I’m waiting for something - waiting in the same way I wait in
front of Thornhill Public School for a non-existent bus to take me
nowhere. I feel cold.

Perhaps it’s just the autumn condensation in the air, but I swear I can
see something on the road in front of me. They glitter like trails of
twilight, or streaks of pale coloured chalk under a layer of Black
Magic. I squint my eyes. If I didn’t know any better, I would say they
are ... streetcar tracks. It’s an odd thought. The only streetcars I
know about are the ones I would always take in the city, in Toronto -
sleek, barely clanking things that ran sporadically at all hours of the
night.

<div class=pullquote>Back in Thornhill Secondary School, my Drama
teacher always said I was “otherworldly”</div>Thornhill doesn’t have a
streetcar line. It hasn’t had one in a long
time. Because … I remember now. Almost every time we drive to Silver
City, in Richmond Hill, my Dad always tells me my grandparents told him
that a streetcar once rode here. It was a railway track that extended
from Toronto and Yonge Street all the way into Richmond Hill and beyond
to Lake Simcoe. Occasionally, I wondered where the line used to stop in
Thornhill. If it did.

But that had been ages ago. The rails had long since disappeared. First
the car became limited to travel only from Toronto to Richmond Hill
until -- after two distant World Wars -- in 1948, it was either covered
over with concrete, or dismantled altogether. It is strange to think
about, as I look at the lines of dew on the neon pastel of the road,
that underneath your feet are the broken ley-lines of previous
connections … of psycho-geography now going nowhere.

I hear the sound of clanking.

Slowly, to the far right of me, I see a shape coming down the slope of
the road. I don’t move. I don’t even make a sound. At first, as I see
its headlights in the distance I think it’s a car or a truck. Then it
comes closer.

It is almost coming towards me now. My sense of waiting becomes a
strange feeling of anticipation. As the shape comes closer, I see that
it’s a round and clunky vehicle. In the light of the full moon and the
few lampposts illuminating the street, it seems to look like a car of a
very worn down Go-Train. But then, as the shadows play over it I can
swear that it looks just like a TTC streetcar.

This isn’t possible, of course. For one thing, the TTC doesn’t run into
York Region. And for another, in that brief glimpse, this streetcar
looks older -- again, bulkier with its red and white paint as faded as
the balls on my grandmother’s pool table. It is like an antique toy of
an old fire-engine.

Then finally, the car or train, or streetcar begins to hiss out
decompressed steam, and comes to a halt right in front of me. It now
definitely looks like a TTC car. I can even make out its serial number:
416. The side door opens and I see a man sitting in the driver’s seat. I
can’t make out his face, but in the dim light of the car’s interior I
know he’s not wearing the maroon jacket of today’s TTC drivers. Instead,
it looks like he’s wearing a grey uniform … or perhaps a brown shirt
with slacks of the same colour.

My Dad once told me he remembered that my grandparents always said the
people of the city looked forward to riding the old radial car with
great joy. And suddenly, it all makes sense. All those years of walking,
and nostalgia, and remembering, and waiting finally make sense.

The driver’s waiting for me. I spare the road around me one last glance.
Aside from my immediate family, no one else will really miss me now. In
fact, I suspect that once I step into this car, I will become part of a
different pattern altogether; a path that very few travel … a road that
has opened itself up to me.

All my glories, and disappointments, all my unfulfilled
dreams and
“what-nows,” all my heaviness and exhaustion will melt away into
mystery. And I will get to fade away with a legend. I think of Edgar
Allan Poe and Randolph Carter’s “Silver Key” as a powerful chill ripples
through my flesh … and I genuinely smile. I now know what I have been
waiting for. Back in Thornhill Secondary School, my Drama teacher always
said I was “otherworldly”. I wonder if he’ll say the same thing now
whenever someone looks at the Writer’s Plaque left behind in the front
hall’s display case after I am long gone.

Then, with this last delicious, satisfying thought in mind I get on the
streetcar and travel … back to the city, to other places, other spaces …
to nowhere, and to everything.

<p class=drop>“Don’t get your head stuck in the Clouds,” my dad would say.  I used
to think that was why our home was miles below the Earth’s surface,
cocooned down near the mantle, the warm bosom of Gaia.  I thought dad
kept us down there to keep us safe, away from the pollution-sickened
silver nitrate skies of the surface.  But the Cloud was everywhere, no
matter how deep you shoved your head in the sand.

<div class=lpullquote>Her name tag reads, ‘Cynthia’... Cyclops slices
around the upper arm and down the length with an Xacto</div>Cyclops and
I bunker down behind the counter of a Starbeans Coffee,
getting a nose and mouth full of dust and cobwebs.  The cold is
chewing its way to my bones, my empty stomach is eating its way out,
and my arm is killing me.  Figuratively of course; the 9mm round
lodged in my tricep we can dig out, and granted it doesn’t infect,
I’ve got a good chance in this hell of surviving.  My NeuroArm, on the
other hand, is literally and definitely going to kill me, and is the
reason Cyclops is fishing for bullets in my nature-issue flesh arm
with a long-nose pliers.  It’s been acting up lately, started
glitching spastic while we were in a shootout with some raiders.  It’s
tough to hit anything when you’ve got cybernetic Parkinson’s disease.

The metal slug squishes out of me with a nauseating movie-quality
slurp.  My vision fuzzes white with pain and I hold back the scream,
clenching my jaw so tight I feel it pop.  We’re pretty sure the fucks
who attacked us lost our tail but we’re not taking any chances.
Cyclops douses the gory hole in my arm with hydrogen peroxide, and the
bubble of sizzling white foam and syrupy red blood on my tan skin
makes me think of strawberry pancakes.  This pisses my stomach off
more, on top of the peroxide stinging like a centiscorpion.  Getting
shot sucks.

“We should get you to a doctor,” Cyclops finds a tray of  non-recycled
napkins, dyed brown to appear eco-friendly, back when such things
mattered to anyone.  He tosses off the top dozen  moldy sheets, and
uses a fresh napkin to dab at the injury.

“It’s just a flesh wound, I’ll be fine.”  <i>But not if we don’t get
this
AWOL prosthetic fixed</i>, I subvocalize.  Cyclops appears unconvinced.

“We’ll be at Ebayzaar in a few days if we make decent time.  They’ll
have a doc there for sure.” I reassure.

The peroxide we scavved up from the carcass of a MegaMart.  Most the
aisles were picked clean as the ribcage of a dead whale, so we were
surprised to find the bottles of disinfectant floating in a mud puddle
in the pharmaceutical department.   As hazardous and unpredictable as
they are, you can always count on raiders and cannibals to fail to
think things through.  Guess you can’t blame them, they are mostly the
descendants of the infamously infantile Chattering Class that went
extinct when the internet and everything else went bye-bye.

The MegaMart had completely computerized self-checkout registers with
RFID and biometric scanners for security purposes, having decided to
do away completely with human clerks just before the world went
belly-up.   Now, I’m no urban archaeologist, but I heard that before
The Silence, the MegaMarts sold cheap, Earth-killing, slave-labor
goods to people who didn’t have the economic luxury of superficial
presentation, so eventually they thought why bother with the flair of
a human clerk?

Starbeans, on the other hand, was targeted toward the spoiled upper
classes who sipped over-designed cups of this stuff kinda like weak
stims in liquid form called “coffee”, while checking  their “Twitters”
and “Portfolios” and discussing “The Teabaggers” and “Fawksnews”.  Not
that the Starbeans’ supply chain was any less karma-negative, but
patrons were paying for the feeling of sophistication and moral high
ground.  Fancy names like Cinnamon Dolce Crème Frappacino, fancy cups.
 They needed this thing called “experience” or “story”, which I could
never understand no matter how many times old-timers explained it.  I
have plenty of experience, lots of stories to tell, nobody ever paid
me.  Sometimes I think The Ancients were all insane, maybe that’s what
dad meant about getting your head stuck in the Cloud.

But the primary reason we’re in Starbeans is every Starbeans, unlike
MegaMart, had several humanoid robots.  Part of the simulated cafe
‘experience’ was having a human barista mix your ten dollar chai
latte, but I guess the profit margin was much better if you didn’t
have to pay real people once the robots got convincing enough.  Lucky
for me, the CLERCs (Cyber-Linguistic Empathic Relations Colleague) all
come with the same line of robotic NeuroArms as the one attached to
the stump where my right arm used to be.  It’s a long story.

There’s one CLERC face down  in the store room.  It’s corroded and
covered in silt, a rat's nest lined with shredded napkins and
artificial sweetener packets is carved out of the android’s stomach
cavity.   Another is at the cashier counter, standing, hand
outstretched as if patiently awaiting payment or a Starbeans Rewards
Card.  Frozen instantly, along with all other robots and androids as
their CPUs were fried by EMPs in the Intellectual Property Wars
decades ago.

Her synthetic skin is dusty and slightly sallow, but remains
remarkably intact.  Her face is locked in an eternal smile of a
lightheartedness utterly alien in the wasteland.  Creepily ironic how
the only remains of the real humans, including her customer, are heaps
of rag and bone on the floor while this replicant appears she might
resume her conversation any moment.  A fossil token of a vanished
culture, caught in the amber of electromagnetic pulse.   Her name tag
reads, ‘Cynthia’.

“Hello Cynthia.  Yes, you can take my order.  One Venti Mochaccino,
made with those Urban-Aggro beans please.   A name for the order?
Make it out to ‘Jericho’.” Cyclops laughs at my little skit even
though he’s seen it before.  I like to pretend.  Maybe it’s my way of
thanking them for letting me use their limbs.  Besides, you’ve got to
learn to enjoy the little things, even when you’re being pursued by
psychotic sub-humans for your flesh, water, and ammunition.  Otherwise
what’s the point, right?

Cynthia’s ancient sleeve comes apart like tissue paper.

“Do you want the dermis too?” Cyclops holds up the naked arm.

“Fuck no.  Just help me cut it open, funny man.”

Cyclops slices around the upper arm and down the length with an Xacto,
pulling back like that scene in Terminator, except there’s no blood,
just rubber and metal skeleton.  I don’t need a womanly hand with
candy apple red nail polish, and the cyborg look tends to frighten the
dumber malicious riff raff.  Mosquito repellant.  Her NeuroArm looks
factory-mint, she was probably on the job only a few months.

Cyclops unbolts it, unbolts mine.  My prosthetic comes off, and
there’s that disorienting feeling of soul-vertigo, that phantom-limb
sense of deep wrongness.  The feeling vanishes just as soon as the new
arm clinks into place, somatosensory cortex settling down to luxuriate
in the newfound sensory input.  My personal bioelectric patterns are
stored in a motor neuron implant that transcodes directly to the
Neuroarm, so the new limb is operational instantly.  None of that
myoelectric stuff, painstakingly shrugging your shoulder, twisting
your neck and squeezing your ass just to signal to your prosthetic to
pick up a damn bottle.

“Better.  Very much so.” I windmill the arm a bit, test the fine motor
responses, pull the rifle from my backpack and take aim at the center
of the peeling ‘S’ on the cracked glass storefront of the Starbeans.
No jittering.

“It looks good, Jerry,” Cyclops says, putting away the Xacto and pliers.

He’s lying, of course, being a good brother.  Cyclops doesn’t see the
world like most people do.  His eyes are blind as a cave shrimp, but
he’s got some brain mod that pipes electromagnetic radiation directly
into his frontal lobe from his shades, like some kind of third eye.
Seriously bleeding edge tech, just before the world fell off the edge.
  However, a side-effect is he definitely can’t tell whether my new
arm looks, “good” or not.  The cortical implant bypasses subjective
aesthetic valuation centers, old mammalian emotion modules buried
deep, a floor above the reptilian brain stem.  For him it’s pure
abstraction, numerology; seeing a sunset is like reading instantly a
spreadsheet on a sunset detailing the frequencies of red, yellow, and
orange light due to Rayleigh scattering, seeing the pointers rather
than actually experiencing all that qualia-rich, heavenly glory.
Kinda how the ancients kept their heads surgically buried in their
“smart” phones, experiencing  sunsets, rock concerts, sex, their
newborns’ first steps, life itself through empty 70-character nibbles
of text, their worlds reduced to two inch touch screens.  In
consolation, Cyclops’ eyes apparently facilitate sensitivity to a
certain monastic, Einsteinian beauty in seeing the “superstructure of
the world”.  That’s what the brochure said, anyway.
At any rate, he’s truly clueless as to the appeal of my latest
prosthetic fashion accessory.
But it’s the thought that counts.

We search the Starbeans for any other useful material, but it’s been
cleared out long ago.  It’s not worth it to dissect the other CLERC
for the extra arm; besides the fact that it’s covered in rat shit,
these Starbeans are so goddamn abundant.  I mean there’s one right
across the street, what is up with that?

We pop open the Reebok knapsack, empty it out on the ground.  A small
can of pork and beans, a twisty-tied packet of a dozen raisins.  It’s
almost comical, except starvation has this peculiar way of filtering
all the funny out of the world, especially when it comes to food.
Cyclops’ head and thin shoulders slump, the skin is draped loosely
over his emaciated bones like sheets over old furniture.  A gust of
cold evening air blows daggers and Cyclops starts shivering, so I
shake the dust out of an Armani suit left in a booth next to a
briefcase and wrap him up in it.

“We’re not going to make it this time, are we?” He stares at a raisin
in the palm of his hand, shriveled and stale to the point of
petrifaction.  Closes it.

“Hey.  Hey, look at me.”  I squeeze his hand tight over the raisin.
“We are going to make it, I promise.”  He is suddenly so small and
fragile.  Everyone grows up so fast out here, there are no childhoods
in the wasteland.  It’s easy to forget he’s just a fourteen year old
kid.

“But you said it’s a few more days if we make good time and we’re
stuck here with no food, and it’s cold and those raiders are out
there-“

 “We’ll make do.  We always do.  They’ve got more food than you could
ever eat at Ebayzaar.  I hear they even have ice cream.  You remember
ice cream?”  The corners of his mouth pull up, and I can see the
episodic memories of birthdays back in the vault spooling through his
mind like a freshly opened bag of jelly candies.   The smell of icing
and melted wax, adults in labcoats and military brass serenading
out-of-harmony, no bed times for one night.

“Remember that time dad got me a bb gun and tried to teach us how to
shoot cans in the water purification room?”

“Yeah, I was still crap at using my vision mod and kept shooting you
guys in the butt.  At least I couldn’t shoot an eye out.”  Cyclops
taps his bionic eye and we both laugh.

“Remember how he used to tell us those crazy bedtime stories when we
were real little?”

“I always liked the one about the people who built their city on the Clouds.”

“They forgot about the real world down below.  One day the Clouds
evaporated, and they came crashing back down.  ‘Their ghosts still
haunt the surface to this day.’”

“I miss dad.”  Cyclops pulls his knees together and the Armani suit
tighter around himself.  His machine eyes lack the tear ducts to cry,
but I know him well enough to know when he is crying inside.

“Me too, Cy.” I gather up his Italian wool-swaddled body in a hug.
I’m lying, about us making it.  We’re at least a week, maybe two from
where this Ebayzaar “Mecca of the Wastes” supposedly is located,
according to an X on a map we plucked off a vulture-pecked body in a
ditch on the interstate.  For all we know, Ebayzaar is a ghost town,
or worse, and out here, the universe’ dice are weighted towards
“worse”.  Maybe we’re the ghosts, haunting the city that fell to
Earth, their streets, their steel-girdered castles, their simulacra of
‘the real world’ run and barista-ed by robot actors.  Maybe we’ll fade
away, at last, like the faux finished signs on storefront windows.

Desperation is an acid that will eat you faster than any cannibal.

And aside from the vague glimmer of someday finding our dad, Cyclops
is all I’ve got keeping me going out here.  So I lie, because I am a
good brother.



<p class=drop>For pretty much all our lives we lived in Elysium Vault, a
cushy EMP/atomic shelter for United Territories of Guugol upper
management, their families, and non-expendables.  Dad, for the moment,
met the non-expendable criteria and thus was allowed one of the
much-coveted spots in the subterranean bunker/enclave.  Or more
specifically, the three pound sack of wet-ware in his head which was
capable of the complex dance of creative imagination and synthesizing
required for highest-level research met the non-expendable criteria, as
the Network-Nations had not been able to automate the process.  Not yet,
anyway.  Lower level scientists and research assistants had already been
rendered obsolescent by poor-performing, buggy, but cheaper “science
engines”, and were left to rot, like post-information age John Henrys.

<div class=lpullquote>We empty
out all the money from the cash register onto the ground, pile on
tooth picks and splintered Starbeans chair legs, start a
fire.</div>Elysium was but one of many secret gardens
that sheltered moguls of
the pre-collapse internet-nations whose wealth made Bill Gates look
like a starving post-print journalist. We had hydroponics, clean
water, a self-repairing 10 MW geothermal plant, everything a
post-apocalypse puppeteering enclave needed.   It wasn’t exactly a
normal childhood, but then the concept of normal didn’t really exist
in the collapsed world anymore, gone as dodo birds and print culture.
The closest thing to high school prom I’d experienced in the Vault was
EMP strike emergency drills, giving CPR to the Yawpper CEO’s daughter,
Candy.   I think somewhere deep down I knew our little gated heaven
wouldn’t last forever, but I filed the thought away on a back shelf,
unable to live in that withering, corrosive state of paranoia, like we
once had to block out, dissociate from the constant existential terror
of EMP Armageddon, and before that terrorism, Cold War.  Dad knew it
too, and I’d only since coming to the surface realized that he’d been
quietly preparing us all along; how to shoot, how to dress wounds, how
to survive among the mindlessness outside, and the heartlessness
inside.

 

<p class=drop>Cyclops’ heat-seeking eye-voodoo susses out a couple
of rats
hiding out
in the chest cavity of the CLERC and we snare ’em, which puts a damper
on our food crisis and provides a much needed morale boost.  We empty
out all the money from the cash register onto the ground, pile on
tooth picks and splintered Starbeans chair legs, start a fire.
There’s a chance the raiders are still out there but it’s much slimmer
at this point.  Plus it’s night, now, so the smoke will be less
conspicuous and we’re freezing our asses off and there’s no fucking
way we’re eating raw rat meat.

We warm our hands, or hand, by the fire, pour the pork'n'beans in a
coffee pot, shishkebab the rat meat.  The raisins we save, they’re so
hard and far past the expiry date we’d probably get more food trading
them as handgun ammo.  The  rat and beans taste like New York steak
and melt-in-your mouth golden mashers when you haven’t eaten anything
in days.

“Man, I haven’t been that stuffed in…  I can’t remember.” Cyclops
flops back on a pillow of dish towels and clothes.

“I say we open up a restaurant when we get to Ebayzaar: ‘Cyclops and
Jericho’s Ratburgers and Beans’.” I rub my swollen belly with my steel
fingers.

“I like the sound of that.”

We kick back around the fire and blue-sky our entrepreneurial future
in the culinary arts, talk old times till the embers burn down to a
puddle of ash pocked with rubies.

“Ok, who wants to take first watch.  Cynthia?” I hand the one-armed
CLERC a SWAT M4 assault rifle.

“I’ll go first, I want to enjoy the sensation of having stuff in my
tummy as long as I can.”  Cyclops takes the gun.

I pop open Armani Man’s briefcase, it’s full of spreadsheets and large
packets of paper thick as money. They bear titles like, “Re-imagining
The Internet: The Cloud 4.0”, “Cost-Benefit Analysis of Converting
Cities to PDMMS (Permanent Digital Massive Multiplayer Societies)”,
And “Social Medianomics: How Individuals Selling Their Social Lives
Can Overcome the Displacement of Middle and Lower Class Jobs by Robots
and Computers.”

I flip through some of these papers; half the words I’ve never even
seen before and it’s like reading a newspaper from an alien planet,
but I get the overall impression this was a guy on a mission, trying
to effect big
changes, probably just stopped here for a latte on his way to a big
‘conference’ thing, when the shit hit the fan.  I figure
he’s not so different from us, we just stopped in for some rat-skewers
before we’re on to bigger and better things in the new cradle of
hopefully more civil civilization.  I go under dreaming of
re-imagining our future in Ebayzaar, running our restaurant in striped
Armani suits, Cynthia waiting tables, Cyclops doing cost-benefit
analyses of using rat versus mutant rattlesnake in the burgers,
veritable captains of post-Silence commerce.

I’m about to take a bite of a juicy ½ lb rat burger when it vanishes
from under my teeth.  I open my eyes, rub the sleep out of them,
Cyclops is prodding me with the handle of the rifle.  “Your turn.”  I
take the gun, check the chamber.  “Sweet dreams, man.”

It’s colder than a mutant girl’s tit out here, and my breath is blue
opaque clouds in the half-moonlight.  I really need to take a leak for
the first time in two days, perfect timing, so I find the deflated
tire falling off the rotten husk of a car, which strikes me as
ridiculous just as I start pouring steaming golden streams down the
rims.  You can piss literally anywhere: in the street, on the windows,
whizz on the biggest desk in the tallest sky-tower in the world, no
one will give a shit.  Maybe it’s one of those DNA memory things,
pissing on tires.

Just as I’m thinking of more evidence to corroborate my tire-peeing
gene theory, I hear a sound like a rat going through a trash can.  I
turn in the direction it came from, squinting, and I’m thinking about
waking Cyclops to help capture this rat take-out for tomorrow when the
rat explodes with a reverberatingly loud crack, and something whizzes
past my ear.  I splash urine all over myself as my brain puts the
evidence together and realizes I’m being shot at, and I’m still peeing
as I dive back through a spiderweb-fractured window of the Starbeans.
Glass is still trickling down in sporadic cracks as I get behind the
counter, making my adrenaline soaked nerves jump every time.  Caught
with my damn pants down.

“Wake the fuck up, Cy, we’re in some shit.”  I shake him up and he’s
got drool matting his hair, mumbling some dream nonsense, but he knows
the tone in my voice and immediately stumbles over for the knapsack,
pulls out a 45 ACP pistol.  I have him run to the back to make sure
the employee back door is locked and we take cover behind the counter.

“You little fuckwits are so dead, and you so fail at pissing, lol.”  I
can hear their raucous stupid laughter and hi-fiving so they can’t be
very far.  I white-knuckle the SWAT rifle, these Chattering Class
spawn may not be very bright, but they are amazingly aggressive and
ruthless, and we’re outnumbered.  And they’re really out for blood
since I took one of them out when they attacked us a couple days ago
at a fuel cell station.


<p class=drop>The story went that the Ancients, “Homo Twitterus” some
called them,
having outsourced not only their physical labor but their intellectual
labor as well to machines, The Cloud and robots, had atrophied their
minds to the point that they couldn’t even do simple math, couldn’t
read any text longer than a blurb, could not put together a coherent
sentence, couldn’t even cook food or wipe their own asses.  They
became instead experts at expanding their social networking “friend
lists”, winning popularity arms races in reputation systems, “self
marketing”, deciding which arguments to win then instructing
evolutionary algorithm-based “debate software” to do the critical
thinking and composition of message posts, hardened ad-hominem
warriors in the Wars of the Flame on the battlegrounds of comment
sections, anti-PR departments the size of 20th-cen countries dedicated
to giving negative feedback on competitors.   Masters at reality TV
and political Truthiness, but failing at understanding reality and
truth.

When the EMPs struck, self-driving supply trucks to cell phone towers
and water purification systems, robot doctors to robot mechanics to
robot farmers, all those gadgets dutifully keeping the cities running
were fried in the blink of an eye as Homo Twitterus chattered, posted,
and flamed away.  But without their machine workforce to maintain the
ephemeral Cloud, the sum total of their internetworked digital world,
the chattering of Homo Twitterus at last ended in The Great Silence.
Unable to sustain themselves, they died, clawing at their touch
screens till their fingers bled, trying to reach through the glass for
their small vanished worlds, turning on one another.  Starving,
choking on empty feeder-tubes, their final breaths spent in throes of
infantile rage from internet withdrawal.



<p class=drop>“Cy, are you getting anything on the infrared?” I scan
wide eyed, but
it’s so dark everything is just a gradient mush of blue and black, I
can barely see a damned thing.

“Nothing, they must still be out of range.”

A burst of automatic gunfire hails into the Starbeans and we dive for
cover.  Fluff from booth seats explodes like blown dandelions, the
cookie display windows shatter, and I hear the deep crumps of bullets
impacting the front of the counter followed by a rain of coffee
straws.  A broken Frappe blending container falls on my head a second
later.

“Ow, fuck!” Deep breaths.  Remain calm, strategize, take it step by step.

I peek back through the gaping hole, fire off a few rounds on a murky
shadow that appears to be moving, hear a satisfying, “Shit, WTF?”

“Wait, I think I see something.  Over there, by the e-newspaper
stands.  It’s… little, though.  Weird signal frequency.  It’s…
Metallica?” Cy head tilts.

Another peculiar little quirk about Cyclops’ vision system upgrades.
He’d always be bursting out with nonsense from nowhere like, “Who is
Charlie Foxtrot?” and “But I don’t know where Defcon 4 is.”  We
thought it was just another few screws that came loose near the audio
cortex when hey installed his implants.  Till one day, we were
listening to some ancient band our dad liked called “The Velvet
Underground” on an ePod.  When we asked Cyclops what he thought, he
said, “It looks great!”  At that point we discovered he could not only
see infrared and ultraviolet, but he could also ‘see’ radio and cell
phone signals, wi-fi, practically the full range of the
electromagnetic spectrum like some kind of human antenna.

The docs  and neuroengineers were floored, never seen anything like
it.  Their verdict was his cerebrum had re-plasticised in response to
the new influx of signal through his forehead, evolved new structure
to interpret the signals, visualize them,  like some kind of human
transmission decoder.  The brain, finding uses for things.  It was the
first successful mind-computer interface – the holy grail of the
neurosci world – and it was wireless, to boot.   They would’ve gone
for a Nobel if there were still a scientific community.  Cyclops was
‘seeing’ transmissions from radios within the base, and not only that,
since the data was flowing directly into his brain – the ultimate
pattern recognition system -- he could crack patterns in any
encryption system in a few seconds as easily as we recognize faces in
clouds.  He would’ve been the ultimate Nahtzi
code-buster in that
Global War II thing.  He liked The Velvet Underground, said they
looked like red and black paint splattered on walls and volcanoes
erupting.

“Definitely Metallica.  It’s coming in faint in the gigahertz
spectrum, but I’m seeing For Whom The Bell Tolls, unmistakably,”
Cyclops pointed in the direction of the source.

“One of those raiders must have an ePod on him.  Where the hell did he
get a working- nevermind.”  I can’t get a good clean shot from where I
am, and from the way they’re spraying lead like firehoses, they’ve got
a lot more ammo to play with than we do, so we’ve got to make our
shots count.

“Ok, here’s what we’re going to do.  Cy, I need you to grab the CLERC
and shuffle her up towards the condiments area right when I give the
signal OK?  And let me know if those bastards change position.”  He
nods, not entirely sure what my plan is, but he knows I’ve got one.
Another salvo of fire takes out the last remaining Starbeans Window
and paints a little dipper of bullet holes just above my head in the
“Happy Hour! 3-5 PM” sign.

“Shit, give me some cover fire.”  Cyclops plants the .45 on the
counter, firing blind in the general direction of the raiders, but it
keeps them down.  I dive into a tumble, ending up under the table of a
booth on the opposite side of the room.  I concentrate on breathing
and wiggle the NeuroArm fingers to make sure it’s not gimping out on
me at Crunch Time.  I’ve got to nail these shots, the first time,
otherwise- well, I can’t think about otherwise.  I’m just thinking
about all the delicious ratburgers we’re going to make when we get out
of this.

Cyclops signals to me that ePod Guy hasn’t moved, I signal back “Now!”



<p class=drop>When the alert came down from the surface that Elysium
Vault had been
breached, there was mass fingerpointing of the highest caliber between
the surviving marketing and legal department remnants of Guugol,
Norizon, Friendbook and other allied networks.  US politics grade
blame-shifting.  Someone in the compound was turned, defected from
Guugol across the Silicon Curtain to the United Aggregation of Eurasia,
nuking the site safely from the orbit of another system.
 Or someone got too close to
the
surface dwellers, let the wrong one in, someone was followed on a
reconnaissance mission, some fatal breach of protocol.  Impossible to
say.  Like asking what was the specific Ferdinand Assassination event
that led the Superpower Network-Nations to launch the EMPs at each
other in Mutually Assured Disconnection?  We’d never know.  The high
and low pressure systems were there, the specific butterfly wing-flap
that initiated the storm was almost irrelevant.

It was utter confusion, then chaos, a flash flood of anomie, like the
rapid phase transition of some kind of unspoken law of societal
physics; a sudden re-distribution of the unevenly distributed
future-hell, the pain not trickling but pouring down.  Screaming, red
flashing lights, sirens, blood, so much blood.  The Netfreaks smelled
the siliconey ozone of still-functioning computers, the air of the
Cloud, and were drawn to it like vampires to blood.  So many of them,
there wasn’t enough ammo, and the corporate guns were overrun in
minutes.  Like the gameover cutscene to one of those Old World zombie
survival horror games.  They went for the AR headsets and smart phones
first, clawing at each other to get their hands on touchpads and eyes
engrossed in screens, refreshing for emails, text feeds that weren’t
there.

Dad was away at Hoover Vault for research at the time, and one of
Guugol’s black-ops guys I recognized as dad’s personal bodyguard
locked us in our room with Candy, told us to stay put.  Candy’s blouse
was ripped, red scratches up her arms like the first stages of WiFi
blood poisoning.  She was crying, said her mom was outside somewhere,
she tried to open the door to look for her but I held her back.  Told
her her mom would be fine, that we had to stay put.  Lied.   I can’t
remember if she broke free and opened the door or if the Netfreaks
broke it down, but I remember her screaming as their filthy, bloody
nails latched onto her and pulled her through the doorway.  I remember
it all too clearly some nights.  What followed was the first time I
killed another person, if what I killed did still count as a human
being, and not just the empty shell, the specter of one.  Time fell
away, all those deeply-programmed sessions shooting cans coming back
as I raised my pistol, shot gory holes in as many faces as I could.

Seconds later the bodyguard pulled us through an auxiliary ventilation
shaft, fleeing the only home we’d ever known that within moments had
been destroyed.  Just fifty feet or so from the exit, the Netfreaks
found their way into the vent system and we were separated from the
agent, who stayed back to hold them off, I still don’t know if he
managed to escape.  When we made it to the surface, we ran into desert
night, no direction, no feeling, no thinking, just flight.  We ran
till our lungs burned holes in our chests and our legs turned to mush.
 Then we ran some more.


<p class=drop>A second after the robot decoy passes in front of the tip
jar, there’s
an absolute shitstorm of gunfire so loud I can feel my brain rattling
in my skull, but I block it out, focus.   I pop up, there are sure
enough two firing uzis full-auto from behind the e-newspaper stand,
one with a pair of white earbuds on, both with drooling homicidal
grins on their faces illuminated by muzzle-lightning, slightly
caved-in foreheads characteristic of Netfreak descendants.   In my
peripheral I spot one behind the car that is covered in my still-warm
pee, wearing a necklace of human teeth.

I aim, breathe, let off a burst once for each raider behind the
stands, the NeuroArm thankfully eliminating muscle tremor and
providing parasympathetic subroutines that autocompensate for the
rifle’s recoil.  Metallica Guy’s head pops like a cherry bomb in a
ripe melon, blood streaking down the white headphone wires as his body
collapses.  The other raider lets out a choking shriek as he catches
one in the arm, whipping it back in a puff of red mist.  Feels good
doesn’t it, fucker.

<div class=lpullquote>“I kind of want the ePod.  I wonder if it has any
Velvet Underground,”</div>The one behind the car screams something about
ripping my head off and
shitting down my neck and I duck just in time to feel his bullets
parting my hair.  The bullet blizzard abruptly haults, followed by
clicking and smacking, and “WTFBBQ!?” followed by unintelligible
strings of pre-Disconnect curse words .  A beat later, there’s
sprinting and I peek over to see this charging lunatic foaming at the
mouth, waving a tire iron around like a medieval mace, the pure
embodiment of Cloud-withdrawal rage, headed straight for me.  Cyclops
fires first, getting him in the upper thigh and shoulder, at which
point he lets out a non-stop, vocal chord-tearing scream but keeps
coming, from the look in his bloodshot eyes he is jacked up on spaz.
I unload the rest of my clip on him, checkerboarding the chest of his
black trench coat with red, which reduces his momentum, but his body
remains in a drug-induced denial of how fucked it is.  I deflect the
tire iron blow with the NeuroArm, using his momentum to flip him over
my shoulder in a Mountain Bomb throw.  He crashes, back-first, onto a
table strewn with coffee cups and  long-defunct laptops, which
collapses.  The body spasms insect-like.

“Drop the gun!” The hoarse voice makes me jump, but in an instant I
realize I don’t want to turn, knowing I’ve fucked up.

I turn to see the limp-armed raider, a giant rusty kitchen knife in
his good, if twitchy hand pressed hard against Cyclops’ throat.  This
one looks older, wiry grey hair on his head and the tell-tale
raccoon-marks around the eyes where permanent computer interface
goggles once clung, ensconcing rapidly darting, distracted eyes of a
pre-Silence Chattering Class netfreak.

“I said drop it you fucking troll!” I’m perplexed at first, then
assume this insult is some sort of artifact of the Chattering Class.
I’m under no illusion that this shit will slit Cyclops throat as soon
as he sees his chance, possibly sooner.  But he also looks like he’s
about an inch away from cracking and the shaky knife hand pulls
tighter, causing Cyclops to let out a whimper.  I spot blood on
Cyclops’ neck, and I decide to drop the gun, kick it aside.  I’m
sorry, bro.

“Now you’re both fucking dead!” His hand starts moving.

“No!  Wait!  I…”  I’ve got about four seconds to think of something,
and I think like our lives depend on it, which they do.  I look down,
spot the blood-soaked laptops and it clicks.

“I can get you some internet!” It’s so utterly ridiculous I just
barely manage to deliver the line with a straight face.

“What?  Where?” The look on his face is some mixture of junkie glaze
and a child on Christmas morning, and for a moment I feel a twinge of
pity, which quickly passes as I realize he was just about to kill my
brother.  He transfixes on me, and the knife falls away from Cyclops’
neck.  Cyclops makes a break for it, and by the time the raider
realizes what’s happened, he’s too late, completely missing Cyclops
with his wild swing and throwing himself off balance.  I take the
opportunity to rush him, grabbing his knife hand in both of mine and
drive it as hard as I can into the pit of his stomach.  He staggers
back, wobbling on his feet, then reaches his hand out towards
something only he sees.   “Internet…” he mutters, crestfallen, then
falls.

In the morning we pack up the food and weapons, search the bodies.  A
couple Coke bottles filled with water, some bits of mystery meat, pack
of cigarettes, no ammo left.  Guess you have to give them an “A” for
effort.  Cyclops lingers over Metallica Guy.  The white headphone
wires are covered in bits of brain and black coagulated blood like
Pocky sticks.

“I kind of want the ePod.  I wonder if it has any Velvet Underground,”
He finally says.  Hey, that’s totally fine with me, I’m not cleaning
that gore off.

Cynthia is a complete wreck from when we used her as an artificial
human shield last night, uniform torn to shreds, metal showing
everywhere, her one remaining arm hanging by a thread at the elbow.  I
almost feel bad for her.  Her face is still caught in that bright,
old-world service industry smile though her right cheek is falling off
and her left eye is a black socket.  A true professional to the end.

“Really sorry about that, Cynth.  It’d probably never work out between
us anyway, this town isn’t really me.  Maybe you can come visit our
place in Ebayzaar some time?” I duct tape her cheek back on as a token
apology.

We follow the boulevard south through the ruins of windowless,
slouching skyscrapers, picking up the journey to Ebayzaar.  Cyclops
finally manages to scrape most of the gunk off the ePod with the help
of the Coke bottle water, plugs in to watch music.  With the raiders
gone, we’re walking lighter, freer, like a weight lifted off our
backs.  The ghosts of the Cloud City are left to rest in peace.  The
new captains of industry have a future to build.

[*BLURB] Is handwritten evidence reliable?<P>

[*DESCRIPTION] 

<I>May 2373 - Account from Professor Mrs Kerstin Johansson,
(semi-retired) of the University of Uppsala</I>

<p class=drop>In my job, I see a lot of writing, not just on paper, but
carved into stone, metal or wood. As an archaeologist at the 
University of Uppsala, ancient writing is one of the basic data sources
for my science. In particular, handwriting is one  of my specialities,
which, I suppose, is one of the reasons why Olaf Ekman's Book arrived at
my workstation, eleven years ago.

Writing by hand is a rarity these days. We see any amount of printed
paper, and lots of tablet notes in a variety of font 
styles, but beyond that... what? People sometimes sketch preliminary
ideas on paper. Shopping lists, score cards, 
yellow sticky notes. The majority of paper manufactured today is used in
an absorbent form to soak up or wipe up spills 
or bodily exudations. You can't write on a nose tissue. I've tried.

Writing being such a rarity, I was surprised that the book was
accompanied in its mailpouch by a handwritten note on a 
plain sheet of heavy paper, signed by the Dean himself. It said, in essence:

1. Do not disclose anything connected with this book to anyone other
than me. Do not file any data connected with this 
project on any computer database. Use only a secure, non-networked computer for your report.

2. You are required to analyse the attached book for authenticity of
origin and language, both in its basic form and, as 
far as possible, with reference to the handwritten additions. Pay particular attention to dates.

3. Transcribe into English the handwritten additions to the text.

4. Submit a single printed report of your conclusions to me in person. 

I was not permitted to retain a copy of the report I submitted, but the
task was so unusual that I still clearly remember 
almost  everything about it.

Ekman's 'Book' was actually an old bible. We see a lot of bibles,
q'rans, little red books  and other religious and political 
tracts in the archaeology business. During most of the history of
printing, religious books in particular were produced 
in huge quantity, so it is not surprising. Besides, in historical times,
superstition made people reluctant to destroy holy 
books, which often survived for many years after their original publication.

This bible was a dog-eared volume some one hundred and forty millimetres
tall, ninety-five millimetres wide and forty 
millimetres thick, as I remember. It had a soft cover of black imitation
leather, torn and scuffed. It was grubby and it 
smelled strangely musty, as though it had been in close contact with animals.

The paper was extremely thin, presumably to make the volume as
physically small as possible. Each sheet was only 
0.05 millimetres thick, so that 1000 pages (500 sheets) measured only 25 mm. 

Bibles were traditionally divided into major sections called 'books',
subsections called 'chapters', and short passages 
called 'verses'. The print was small, in two columns per page, with each
Book named, and each Chapter and Verse 
numbered.

The publication date of this Holy Bible was 2145, over 200 years old
when I first saw it. It was in English, published in 
London at the Hackney University Press, and must have been one of the
last so-called King James versions published, 
the earliest examples of which date from the 1600s. By 2145, the 17th
century language used was unfamiliar to nearly all 
speakers of English, and the bible in use was commonly rendered in
contemporary language, just as on-line versions 
are today.

I sent samples of the cover, paper and ink of the bible for analysis,
without revealing their source. The plastic cover and 
the paper were the right age, the printing ink correct. I was able to
borrow another copy of exactly the same edition from 
Stockholm University library, and it was identical, other than wear and
tear; the physical appearance, the pagination, 
font, printer's marks, even the few accidental flecks that always used
to appear on a printing plate.  On balance, forgery 
of the book itself was very unlikely.

However, what made this bible interesting was that almost every blank
space - end-papers, margins and chapter breaks 
- was filled with handwriting in ballpoint pen, whose ink was initially
consistent with the age of the entries. Later entries 
were in a more primitive ink which later turned out to be coffee. The
book, or diary, was, in fact, a palimpsest. The 
original meaning of the bible text apparently meant nothing to the writer.

I remember that, at first, I didn't even realise that the handwriting
was in Swedish. Swedish is theoretically my native 
language, but here in the twenty-fourth century, there are few daily
speakers of the language. It was hard to recognise, 
because the handwriting was atrocious. Even after a lifetime of
deciphering ancient documents, I found it extremely 
difficult to read, and the writer, in search of writing space, had
filled all the big areas before resorting to margins and 
column gutters, and the whole narrative was therefore out of sequence,
and the writer clearly lost track of dates very 
early in his account.

In my opinion, the language and handwriting style used were consistent
with a Swedish male educated within rural 
Sweden in the early part of the twenty-second century, about two hundred
years ago. For the language, I based my 
assessment on similar documents of comparable age: the vocabulary
(especially the paucity of imported English and 
other foreign words); punctuation; grammar; and sentence structure used.
For the handwriting, my clues were letter 
shapes and connectors, and, particularly, accents and diacritical marks.

As to content, the writer calls himself Olaf Ekman. There was no
immediate way to verify this. He was unclear where he 
was living, lacked company, was unclear about his situation but
had adjusted to it. The account was 
long, repetitive and tedious. It also lacked biographical detail.

Using parish and census records, I was able to identify more than two
hundred possible Olaf Ekmans living in Sweden at
the approximate period, but there was insufficient supporting historical
data in his written account for a positive 
identification. Certainly, several of these Ekmans lacked information on
date and place of death, but emigration to other 
countries typically interrupts the life records of individuals living at that time.

In conclusion, while I was unable to comment on any possible delusion on
the part of Olaf Ekman, the physical book
appeared entirely authentic, and the style of the palimpsest content was
entirely consistent with Ekman's assertions as 
to year of writing.

<I>Appendix

Some extracts from Olaf Ekman's writings. As I state in the body of this
account, the whole is both
boring and baffling. Part of the confusion results 
from the fact that Ekman does not initially reveal that he is living in
a supermarket delivery van. Late in the account, he 
reveals that the bible, which some other driver had left in the cab, was
not the only paper available to him, but that he 
valued the other paper for lighting fires. He would never burn a bible,
apparently. However, the ball-point pen he had in 
his pocket was the only writing implement available. The pen ran out
before the available paper in the bible and the last 
entries are laboriously scratched with something dipped in a dye made
from coffee. The van load, luckily for Ekman, 
was mostly preserved foodstuffs with a few other everyday items and some women's clothing.</I>

1 June 2151: My name is Olaf Ekman. I have been here for about a month,
but I do not remember how I came. The last 
date I clearly remember is  3 May 2151, so I shall call today 1 June. I
have shelter, there is more than enough to eat and 
drink, but my life is empty. I have not seen another person, bird or
animal since I arrived. The van is completely out of 
fuel and the GPS and radio light up but appear to be broken. The solar
panels collect a little energy, but not enough to 
drive the van any distance. Tomorrow I shall walk to the west (the
position of the setting sun) in the hope of 
encountering a neighbour or a road.

12 June 2151: Ten days and I was lucky to get home. The terrain is flat
and almost treeless in all directions from here. 
After two days pushing through alternate stony desert and ankle-deep,
flat-leaved vegetation, I came to a low hill, but 
the view from the top, in all directions, was exactly the same. I had
taken enough food for seven days, turned back after 
three, and missed the van on the way back. It took three days to find
it. Perhaps this is Canada. Are there volcanoes in 
Canada? 

20 June 2151: I managed to cut down one of the tall plants, about ten
metres high, with a kitchen knife from the van. The 
wood is soft like a cactus, and very light. There was a box of balls of
string in the delivery. I tied a very bright yellow 
frock to the top of the pole, and managed to fix it to the van as a
flagstaff. I will not miss the van next time I explore. I 
have decided to climb the volcano. I will see more from there.

<I>It appeared to take Ekman several months to achieve this objective.
The volcano was so far away that he was forced 
make huge numbers of part trips to set up supply caches en route because
he could not carry enough food and water 
for the complete journey. In turn, this meant that he needed to signpost the route from cache to cache. </I>

20 October 2151: So, in summary, the trip to the volcano was not a total
waste of time. From near the top, it was clear 
that I am on an island, and it appears uninhabited. Although I never see
any aircraft, I am building a sign to attract 
attention and will keep a fire burning day and night in hope of rescue.

25 October 2151: It rains a lot here, with remarkable thunder and
lightning. It is difficult to keep the fire lit. It is good that 
the load includes a whole case of gas lighters.

6 November 2151: The moon looks smaller from here. Maybe it is the flatness of the land. 

<I>There follow twenty-two years' worth of increasingly sporadic
entries, most may be summarised by 'got up, ate 
tinned stew, it rained, collected fuel for the fire, went to sleep', a
pattern which must be a feature of the life of any 
castaway. The constant fire was abandoned when it took nearly a day to
collect a day's fuel. Every so often, when the 
solar panels had accumulated a little energy, he moved the van a few
hundred yards to another area with more fuel. 
Eventually, he was only a day's walk from the sea, but his attempts to
catch fish were unsuccessful. He never saw 
another living creature on land or in the sea. Latterly, entries were
interspersed by occasional complaints of this 
type:</I>

12 September 2166: Becoming worried that the tins of food will only last
a few more years. I have finally tasted the red 
bush fruit that look like little jugs that I always thought would be
poisonous. I was right. They were almost tasteless, but 
caused terrible stomach pain. So far, there is nothing at all on this
island that I can eat except the tomatoes and grapes 
that still sprout on my dungheap, and I think I brought these here
myself! Happily, the rain water, though it tasted 
strange at first, has always been OK.

<I>It should have been a soul-destroying existence, very much like a
life sentence in solitary confinement, yet Ekman 
appears to have accepted it without either complaint or curiosity. There is no self-pity even in the last entry of all:</I>

1 January 2173: Happy New Year. I opened the last tin today - one I have
been keeping for a final treat - peaches. I hate 
to think how much I owe DK-Mart Supermarkets - a whole delivery! I
estimate 20000 kg of tinned and packet food alone, 
not counting the soft drinks, beer and vodka. And all these ladies'
dresses and sandals I used when my overalls and 
boots wore out! There is no more food, so when I get hungry I will eat
as many painkillers as I can and fall asleep. I am 
sorry, DK-Mart, you will never be paid. Let us say that I have taken my salary in kind. Goodbye.

<I>Ekman's death occurred two hundred years ago this year. We still do
not know how he came to be marooned.</I>

<hr>

<p class=drop>Kerstin showed her unexpected visitor into her kitchen.
The man had
arrived unannounced, presented his identity 
badge to her entry scanner, and been admitted without delay and without
requiring Professor  Kerstin Johansson's 
permission. This was the sign of a very important person.

"Coffee?" she offered.

"No, thank you. This is your report, recorded recently, is it, Professor?"

Kerstin Johansson regarded the rather pale young man with rising
suspicion. He had a friendly face, but that meant 
little these days. He had unrolled a flekskreen, and  passed it across
the kitchen table. She recognised the article she 
had posted on the net the previous day. "Who did you say you were?" She
had been so surprised at his arrival that she 
had not read the admission read-out on her entry screen.

"Anders Lid&eacute;n, UN Truth Commission. Your article, is it?"

"Yes, but I fail to see the problem."

"You are aware that your work on this project was highly confidential." It was a statement, not a question. 

She suddenly perceived that Lid&eacute;n's blue eyes were acutely
piercing. Her stomach sank. The UN Truth 
Commission had a reputation for ruthlessness in the pursuit of academics
who crossed the line. "Confidential, yes, but 
eleven years downstream? And it's a sad story, someone marooned for so
long, but it can hardly be important. It 
happened so long ago - two hundred years this year. That's why I wrote the memoir."

"And you were given leave to publish by whom?"

"No-one. But this is not my original report, which I agreed to keep
confidential, just a memoir."

He pursed his lips. "Hmm.. A prevarication. And the quotes from your
transcript of Ekman's journal?"

"They were not quotes! You will probably see differences from the
original transcript... I... er... kept images of a few 
pages and re-translated them."

 Lid&eacute;n rolled up the flekskreen and returned it to his hip bag.
 "A memoir, you say. Could your memory be faulty, 
do you think?" He was watching her carefully.

"I don't believe so. I was careful not to guess anything that I could not clearly remember."

"Such as?"

"Lab results. Number of journal entries. I don't know. How long the investigation took."

"I see."

"Look. If the information is still secret, then I'll withdraw the net release."

"Oh, it was withdrawn this morning, and cleared from all public caches.
There may be a few copies in private hands, but 
without the original, they lack substance. We can handle that sort of thing." 

"So, will I be prosecuted for breach of confidentiality?"

"Oh, I hardly think so. A prosecution would be too noticeable. No, we
want you to publish, but with certain small 
changes."

Kerstin could feel her hackles rising at the prospect of being forced to
publish a lie at the request of the Truth 
Commission. She knew it happened, but not, surely, to archaeologists. "I
don't understand. Was this Ekman 
important?"

"You were never told where the book was found?"  It was clearly
Lid&eacute;n's turn to be surprised. He immediately 
appeared less menacing.

"No. I wondered at the time, but I wasn't asked to speculate. It seemed
shocking that he was never found, but I suppose 
there are still remote places like that, even today."

Lid&eacute;n deployed his flekskreen again and opened a form. "As things
stand, your report is suppressed. If you 
endorse this official security form, I will give you some information.
The form is specific to this information and does not 
constrain you in any general fashion. If we later discover that you have
revealed that information, you will be 
sanctioned. On the basis of the information I give you, you may decide
to publish your report with changes we suggest. 
Otherwise, it remains suppressed."

"In short, I have nothing to lose, but not a lot to gain, either."

"True. But you are now fascinated to discover the secret. That's a gain."

"All right. I am fascinated."

"OK. Look at the screen until the retinal scan clicks, and then say 'I
endorse form number ' and read the number on the 
screen."

The familiar formality complete,  Lid&eacute;n began. "The book and Ekman's remains were found in 2268."

"But that was, what, nearly a hundred years before it came to me. Yet I remember a sense of urgency."

"That is because, even with the fastest transport  available, it took nearly a hundred years to get to you."

"I don't understand."

"Yes you do."

"Of course. A space colony."

"Pacifica, formerly called HD69830-4. The starship UNSS Shardik was
launched in 2080, when it was feared that our 
planet might soon become uninhabitable. Like the other starships
launched in the late 21st, Shardik carried a 
population of 50000 crew, a self-sustained town. Travelling at an
average of approximately one quarter light speed, 
Shardik arrived in orbit around Pacifica a hundred and eighty-eight
years later. A few of the older travellers could 
remember their grandfathers telling them about Earth, but none had known
any environment but Shardik. Most had been Shardik natives for six or
seven
generations. As you know, a number of starships have failed as a result
of accident, breakdown or civil anarchy, but 
Shardik was a great success."

"Yes. I've read about it."

"During computer analysis of the aerial survey on the planet Pacifica,
shape
anomalies were identified. Most anomalies in the 
survey turned out, on closer inspection, to be unusually regular natural
features. However, telescopic images revealed 
that one island had on it," he consulted his screen, "a rectangular
structure some fifteen metres in length and three in 
width, and, nearby, some arrays of rocks, hundreds of metres in extent
and partially obscured by low vegetation, 
reading 'SOS', a traditional distress signal. A landing vehicle was
immediately deployed to the site,
and it was revealed that the rectangular object 
was an antique road vehicle containing the remains of a human being. The
human remains and a few personal effects 
were returned to UNSS Shardik, where they were subject to analysis in their laboratory." He looked up.

Kerstin grimaced. "They couldn't read Ekman's journal."

"They could read the dates, though. The publication date of the bible.
And the expiry dates on Ekman's cans and 
bottles. And they were not pleased."

"I'm beginning to see why."

"You and your family for several generations travel for a hundred and
eighty-eight years, only to discover that
a supermarket delivery vehicle has beaten you to 
your destination by one hundred and seventeen years."

"I see. So Shardik's crew theorised that we, on Earth, had developed a
much faster transport system, making their 
marathon journey and lost generations a bit meaningless."

"Exactly. Radio messages to and from Pacifica take forty-six and a bit
years each way, so a lively exchange of views is 
impossible. But we received images of the bible about sixty years ago.
Travelling by very fast unmanned capsule, the 
bible itself arrived together with soil samples and other physical
artifacts from Pacifica just eleven years ago, when you 
saw it."

"Presumably, then, UNSA have, indeed, developed a much faster space drive, but do not want to talk about it."

"In point of fact, no. UNSA has achieved marginal improvements in ram
ion drives, but nothing that would transport 
Ekman and his truck almost instantaneously.  It was concluded at this
end that since it was impossible, the crew of 
Shardik must have contrived an incomprehensible elaborate  practical
joke, mocking up photographs of the bible, the 
truck, the food cans."

"And then I certified Ekman's book as real."

"Exactly."

"So how did Ekman get to Pacifica?"

"That's just it. It can't possibly have happened. Therefore, it did not
happen. Therefore, the whole tale must be a clever 
fake, and your report must make that clear."

Kerstin stared at, or, rather, through Lid&eacute;n for a few seconds.
"No. I don't believe it. Disregarding the fact that a 
joke like that is highly unlikely, the bible is genuine. I'm sure of it."

"Yes, I'm sure it is." said Lid&eacute;n, "But if the real truth got
out, it would have the most depressing effect on morale. 
Asking you to put a little doubt into the situation is much preferred."

"The real truth? All I can imagine is that it was all faked at this end and Shardik's crew made no such discovery."

"Not at all. As far as the inhabitants of Pacifica are concerned, it's a
historical fact, and the truck is on view there for 
anyone to see, as you can confirm with your own eyes if you have a couple of centuries to spare."

"Are you saying you know how it happened?"

"Not in detail, but it is simply another confirmation of a phenomenon
that has been happening since the mid twentieth 
century. The vast majority of these incidents are virtually dismissed.
Anyone pursuing them is regarded as a crank, 
Ekman's case is embarrassing because he turned up a long way from home with supporting physical evidence." 

 Lid&eacute;n displayed an image of a piece of yellowed paper, printed in Swedish.

"What's this?" asked Kerstin, but went on translating aloud,
" 'Bure&aring; Weekly News 5 May 2151'. It's one of those
local newspapers from country backwaters that survived net news because
local events were never reported on the 
net. The date. It's something to do with Ekman, isn't it?"

"This may explain why we have no wish to provide confirmation of the
likely explanation."  Lid&eacute;n enlarged a 
small paragraph at the foot of the page. 

Kerstin read the brief article quickly. "Ah, small and green, are they?"

"Allegedly. We've never caught them in the act."

"I can see why me making a mistake is preferable to this."

"We hoped you'd see it that way."

CELESTIAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY<br><br>
On Wednesday night several inhabitants of Skellefte&aring; reported
seeing strange lights travelling across the sky from west to  east at
remarkable speed, making sharp changes of direction and changing colour
from white to pink and back again. Some witnesses reported strange
noises. A farmworker, Karin Lindemann (42), alleged that she was
'bombarded with live frogs'. A huge cylindrical depression was found in
an oilseed rape field, surrounded by burn marks.<br><br>
<img src="nyheter.jpg" align=right> The local UN radar base at Pitea
reported that nothing was seen on their screens, and a spokesman
confided that the villagers had most probably observed the aurora
borealis. Electricity worker Frederik Hansen (55) dismissed this
suggestion, as all local people at this latitude are familiar with the
northern lights. He said this was not the first time that unusual lights
had appeared in the night sky (see Bure&aring; Weekly News 14 Mar 2150),
and that a UN soldier from the radar installation had revealed that the
lights did in fact appear on radar, but were denied by the
authorities.<br><br>In a possibly connected incident on the same
evening, a DK-Mart delivery
truck disappeared on the coast road between Yttervik and Skelleftehamn
It is feared that the driver, Olaf Ekman, may have been distracted by
the
strange lights and plunged into the sea. Coastguards and police have so
far failed to establish the truth of this theory.</div>

<i>Tell us something<br>
(Anything)<br>
 (Yes)</i>

I'll tell you about my day. You always know we're coming because we
advertise: our kites go up days in advance, their lasers streaking the
clouds and high rises; adver-screamers roam the streets, hacking phones
and kits, flooding your width with promises. You know what we are - it's
not a secret, it's a selling point - and you dare each other to buy
tickets, to make a night of it. You look ahead and insert yourself into
this scenario. But you're never prepared. 

<i>Yes <br>
 (She's right) <br>
(Tell us why)</i>

You've been spoilt. You're used to 3D Virt, GamingR, ExtraLife and all
the other reality playrooms and you forget this is real, that we are
real, the way a line of code or a pixelated image just isn't. It takes
about twenty minutes to sink in. Then you start to react.

<i>What happens?<br>
(Are we afraid?)<br>
(I wasn't)	<br>
 (You were)</i>

It's never the same. It depends where we are. 

<i>Meaning?<br>
 (I don't understand)</i>

Hang on. It doesn't take me long to make up: I only have to pull on the
dress, throw on some paint, brush and balance this wig -

<i>Pretty<br>
 (Not real?)</i>

- no, not real. I can't even dye my hair. My skin won't take the
chemicals. Because I have free time, I take a few hours to wander each
town. No-one ever realises what I am; I wear a hood and walk the strips,
past the screamers for other shows, sizing up the competition. I'm
looking for a certain type of small shop, somewhere low and grimy. It
will have dirty windows. It will be dark and warm. I'll go inside and
buy a small paper card, running my fingers over the picture, shapes of
cliffs and beaches, and try to learn about my audience.

<i>Tell us how<br>
(Quiet)</i>

It's my own theory: topographical mind mapping. Don't laugh.
Valleys-dwellers widen eyes and apertures but don't move, and they never
ask questions. Mountain-people are sceptics <i>- faked - it's a trick
-</i> and
can't wait to get past the dampers, get outside, plug in and find out
how it's done. Coastals, like here, are different again: silent
watchers, immediate believers. Accepters of myth and the secrets of deep
water. Of creatures left behind.

<i>Yes. <br>(Go on)<br> (Tell us about here)</i>

I found my shop early. As I flicked through the dusty boxes the staff
watched me; they were hosting my advert for the show, but they had no
way of knowing, not without this wig, this paint. All they saw was a
girl. They were sitting on high chairs, leaning back
against the wall, icams
whirring as they focused on my face. <i>Are you going? We're selling
tickets.</i> Each had one eye milked as they paralleled, maybe watching
the
news, a movie, porn-porn of me perhaps; their cams might have been
chipped. Maybe, tucked inside their visual field, I was fucking a vid
creation, a beast, a bird, a monster. Maybe they were hurting me,
watching tears cut new patterns into my blood-stained face. Or maybe
they were just Booking.  

They had enough attention left over to complain
about accepting my coins after I exposed my wrist and told my usual lie.
<i>Chip magged, pain in the arse, I know...</i> At least they didn't
charge me
extra for having to use a card. <i>Where's it going, girly?</i> The
question
came out of nowhere, and for a second I thought I'd been recognised. I
stared. 

<i>Postcard.</i> A real finger pointed to the image in my hand.
<i>Who're
you sending it to?</i> In situations like that I have learnt to smile,
shake
my head and leave.

<i>(What happened)</i>

When I stepped out of the shop there were more bods on the strip, all
looking for a good time. It was getting late, the overheads brightening
the clouds, and there were clubbers outside Pleasure Plaza, calling,
dancing, happy that the working week was over. One skipped over, waving,
and I knew I must have been Booked, but again I could only shrug and
walk away.

In the distance the kites swooped and sang, advertising the show,
sending down words and pics to curve on the pavement. They go so high,
anchored by unbreakable steel strings, and the vibration hums upwards,
all the way up to the bright dancing body. I stood and watched. When
it's busy Davvers lets me launch them, unwinding the long loops, sending
them further up to beam back their message, FREEKSHOW 2NITE. Calling to
the crowds. Calling to you.
	
I took my picture back to the tent and propped it against my tray of
paints, so I could study it as I whitened my face, darkened my eyes; one
paper rectangle, framing a point of transition; sea and slate, blues and
greys, one into the other beneath mirroring skies. The natural state of
things. I knew you wouldn't be afraid.

<i>Tell us more<br>
 (About the show)<br>
(Your words)</i>

Bunny always opens the act, voice as deep as your shock. Although only
one of the heads is actually alive, the other never lolls or dribbles.
It always blinks, and seems to look around. It wiggles its nose.
Sometimes, one of the eyes will droop in a wink. Bunny will see it, and
turn to the nearest member of the audience.  <i>Likes you,</i> Bunny
will say, practised leer on the living mouth. <i>Kiss?</i>  Then drop
forward and bring their mouthparts level. No one has ever kissed that
second mouth, which is strange, because Bunny gets a lot of action after
the curtain drops.
	
After the tumbling acts have been on, armPlants whizzing around the
arena, it's the animals. You always love the monkey wedding. I don't
know why.

<i>Real animals?<br>
(I thought they were fake)<br>
(They look almost human!)</i>

As you saw, my act closes. It goes like this. The damping field cuts
in - no-one is allowed to vid me; it would ruin us if pics leaked - and
Bunny leads me out, our three heads bobbing to the sub-enhanced beat. I
sit, smooth my hands over this pink and yellow-striped dress, the whole
look designed to keep me on the right side of cartoon. I am not here to
frighten.

<i>Why are you here?<br>
(Don't ask that)</i>

Well, I'm unemployable.  At first, it was this or nothing, and I
wouldn't smile, which made the audience fear me even more. But I came to
feel differently about it after the third show.  Someone put out their
hand and touched my face as I was doing my act, gently stroking me from
my hairline to my jaw, and thanked me. I asked what for. <i>Because we
forget,</i> they said, golden lip slot gleaming, <i>and we
shouldn't.</i> It made me feel important. When everyone had gone I
climbed up the tent, high up into the roof, and sat on the scaffolding.
I thought about what it means for people like you to see someone like
me.

<i>Funny!<br>
(Educational)<br>
(An advert?)</i>

Perhaps. I think it's more a memory. 

<i>Go on</i>

Lifting the cover is always a tense moment. Sometimes I can't identify
the contents, not at first, and I used to worry about a mistake being
made, something damaging or deadly or just not <i>right</i> - but I've
learnt to trust the team here. They've never let me down. Davvers'
ringruler routine is always perfect, carefully pitched to the crowd's
needs. I know I'm cared for. Davvers will even end the show early if I'm
getting too much of the wrong sort of attention -

<i>Like what?<br>
(Are we hurting you?)<br>
(Shall we move back?)</i>

No, no, you're wonderful. Perfect, in fact. But I sometimes get the
after-effects of fear: pinching, scratching, offers of sex, of love, of
death. I never cry, that would be unprofessional, but Davvers is always
watching, always knows. Then long fingers reach though the crush of
flesh and fakes and draw me out, hiding me under that red tailcoat,
toplight flashing, volume up, roaring me to safety.

But not today. Today, everything went well. When I lifted the cover I
was overjoyed. Long green stems, heated with water vapour to soften
them; a small grey fish, also warmed in water, its bulging eye cast up
at me with a wink of seasoning. I was surprised for a moment, and then I
remembered where we are. They're still caught for sport round here, yes?
Someone knows someone who can keep a secret. I picked up the utensils
that none of you can name, and cut. Pushed. Lifted.

When the first piece of green went into my mouth I heard a voice.
<i>No.</i> I
chewed slowly, letting you watch the movement of my jaw muscles, knowing
you were picturing my teeth, my wet mouth. I swallowed, smiled, looked
down. Cut into the fish.

Davvers started up the low patter that's designed to cover stunned
silences. You were addressed as <i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>, part of the
ambience of the piece, and invited closer. You paused, and then surged,
a wave of bodies, leaning so far over that you knocked me with your
icams. <i>Excuse,</i> I heard, <i>Please,</i> and I smiled again, and
opened my mouth,
displaying the mashed and sticky pile.

<i>And how do we make you feel?</i>

Although many of you came down to be with me, I know that others have
left in disgust. They are outside, Booking each other, chipped in to
whatever gives them comfort, on their way home. Some feel sorry for me,
that I have been neglected somehow. Some always contact authorities,
charities, to get me rescued, to get me healed. Kindly Plant surgeons
offer to work for free. Kindly businesses offer to pay.

<i>But still you choose to remain you<br>
(Pure)</i>

No. Listen. This is important. Each time, afterwards, I explain how this
isn't a choice; my body rejected the Plants as fast as they're
implanted. I'm still just a girl, sat alone on the edges of
communication, of information, of life. There is no higher moral purpose
to this; just a blind person allergic to sticks.

<i>But you are pure -</i>

What value is purity? If you can't change, you can't grow. I'm purest
stagnation. I'm the dullest grey.

<i>Do you have time for more questions?</i>

No. Wait - yes, I do, but they are for you. I have a thousand. Can tell
me
what it means to see the sun sing? How does it feel to be inside the
mind of your lovers? To remember every day of your life? What is it like
to never be alone?

<i>We cannot (Excuse) (Cannot) (You wouldn't under-)</i>

I know. This is why I ask you here. You mustn't falter now. Get out, go
as far as you can, and send back pictures.

<i>And you?</i>

I'll always be here, looking up. I'll be your kite string.

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] A delightful little vignette which actually contains more truth
than fiction.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>We had to endure the usual oblique glances
from Altdorfer’s aunt as we passed through the sitting-room.  Each time
I visited the house, she had been sitting in the same armchair, knitting
the same quilt.  Altdorfer says it was originally intended as a scarf,
but the old gentleman for whom it was generously being created had
inconveniently died at quite an early stage of its colourful growth.
Thereafter the scarf increased in dimensions and complexity,
prospectively becoming first a rug and then a quilt.  By now it could
easily be used to camouflage a tank, and is well on its way to providing
cover for, say, a football field.  Given time and a sufficient supply of
wool, it may ultimately replace Wales as a popular measure of disaster
areas.</P> <P>I followed Altdorfer through to the study.  If ever a room
deserved the name, this was no longer it.  I knew it to harbour a desk
and chairs, but these could now be seen only in tantalising glimpses,
like the ankles of a demure Victorian maiden. They were concealed by a
seemingly random overspill from the well-stocked bookshelves which
obscured the walls.  Somewhere there was even a computer.  Among the few
items of furniture which remained relatively uncluttered was the old
floral-patterned sofa, threadbare but still reasonably comfortable, and
it was to this familiar relic that we gravitated.</P>

<P>The box-files stacked on an adjoining coffee-table allowed just
enough room for a bottle of Altdorfer’s favoured Kirsch and two
surprisingly clean squat glasses.  He filled these, and handed one to
me.  &quot;Up theirs!&quot; we chorused ritually, before resuming the
serious business of studying the startling batch of documents I had been
left by Ryan Trench.</P>

<P class=drop>We had known Trench when he was a young classics student
with an interest in Sanskrit and Monopoly.  The Monopoly should have
given us a clue to his secret acquisitiveness.  He was a gawky, awkward
youth, socially inept, but evidently a good scholar, with a conviction
that one day he would make his mark on the world.  To that end he
cultivated an accent one might associate with an effete aristocracy, yet
exhibited a kind of fawning gratitude towards those who were indulgent
towards him despite his gauche behaviour.</P>

<P>I was working at the time for a long-established antiquarian
bookseller; an old family firm, learning the intricacies of cataloguing,
and it was there that Ryan Trench found a vacation job in the downstairs
packing department.  Below this were ‘The Vaults’ – the sub-basement
storage area containing thousands of dusty volumes waiting to be sorted
and priced.  This led out through the tradesman’s entrance, where Ryan
parked his bike, to the cobbled streets of old Edinburgh.</P>

<P>I had a flat nearby, and at some point Ryan began dropping in at
week-ends, quite possibly uninvited, and irrespective of whether I might
already have company.  On one such visit he arrived just as a casual
game of Monopoly was about to begin, and it would have been churlish not
to invite him to join in.  I forget now which assembly of my friends was
present.  Altdorfer, certainly, probably Marcus and Stella, maybe
Anitra, or Piers.  In contrast to our laid-back, convivial approach to
the game, Ryan’s was compulsive, intense.  To him it was not a game to
be enjoyed, but an opportunity to exercise control.  And when he failed
to accumulate sufficient property or wealth, the fault had to lie in the
inadequacy of the rules, or the design of the board.  After several
sessions Ryan excused himself, and spent the next few weeks
constructing, in his spare time, a larger board with additional squares
and their related property cards, and extra model buildings to represent
a level of possession beyond hotels; historic houses, perhaps, or
palaces.  Much to his chagrin, by the time he brought this superior
version to our attention, we had thankfully outgrown Monopoly in any
form.</P>

<P>Not long after his graduation, Trench’s mother, his remaining parent,
had died, bequeathing him their house in a leafy Edinburgh suburb.  On
one occasion he unexpectedly invited me round to sample his vintage
Tokay.  I had not been there long before he revealed his ulterior
motive.  &quot;Come and see the attic,&quot; he said.  There I was
amazed to see, neatly cleaned and shelved, a large number of mostly
vellum-bound Latin texts – antiquarian treasures – which he had secretly
been liberating from their centuries of captivity in ‘The Vaults’.  He
seemed inordinately proud of this ‘cultural rescue’, as he called it,
and quite oblivious to the possibility that he might be charged with a
criminal offence.  As it happened, he was soon to lose his job when the
owner of the premises interrupted a further ‘rescue’ mission, by
enquiring exactly what it was that Ryan was strapping to the back of his
bike.</P>

<P>Fortunately for Trench, the disappearance of earlier volumes had not
been noticed, and since he had not previously drawn attention to his
rescue service, he thereby avoided prosecution.  What became of all
those confiscated books we never discovered, but from the sporadic cards
I received over the next few years we do know that Trench eventually
sold the house, moved to London, and became a professional
archaeologist.  None of us saw him again.</P>

<P>Almost a quarter of a century later I was contacted by a very
respectable Scottish lady, a former fellow-student of Ryan’s, who
informed me of his recent death, and explained that she was now his
executrix.  Despite those long years of silence, the news of his death
genuinely saddened me, and I was surprised and curiously flattered to
learn that he had valued our brief crossing of paths enough to leave me
a few illustrated books and a collection of papers.  The books were
early twentieth century, and attractively decorated by an artist he knew
I liked.  The papers were quite another matter, and as soon as I saw
their contents I realised that I needed to consult Altdorfer.</P>

<P class=drop>You probably know of the so-called ‘Antikythera device’;
the fused clump of corroded bronze recovered by a diver from the sea bed
near Crete in 1900.  Seven or eight decades later, after much expert
examination, and the application of x-ray tomography, it was deduced to
be a precision-made astronomical calendar with over thirty differential
gears, designed to demonstrate lunar and planetary cycles with a high
degree of accuracy.  Working models have since been reconstructed as
proof of this complex example of technology from more than two millenia
ago.  This mechanism is generally regarded as the oldest such device
known, but there is no reason to believe it was unique.  In historical
perspective it was predated by air-guns, alarm clocks, convex lenses,
chain-drives, lathes, the magnetic compass, and of course the
steam-powered toy pigeon with which Archytas of Tarentum amused himself
and possibly the younger members of his family.</P>

<P>But even that takes us only to about 420 BC. Two or three thousand
years further back we are still in familiar territory: beer and
dentists, glassmaking and weighing machines, maps, contraceptives and
gold mines, not necessarily in order of priority.  Another ten or twenty
thousand years into the past we have figurines, weaponry, evidence of
needlework, painting, musical instruments.  Stone lamps have been found
from sixty thousand years before that, while the earliest known
decorative amulets date from more than 100,000 years ago – a small
fraction – a mere 5% - of the traceable existence of tool-making
hominids on this planet.</P>

<P>Civilisations rise and fall, succumb at length to inescapable natural
processes – erosion, earthquake, eruption, landslide, tsunami, flood,
fire, drought, and consequential biological scourges such as starvation
and disease.  Perhaps one should include climate-change and asteroid
impact as lurking triggers.  The odd gamma-ray burst from a distant
pulsar cannot be discounted.    It’s also salutory to remember that the
Easter Islanders ran out of trees, and that in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century we have an enormously improved capacity for
self-extermination.</P>

<P>As Altdorfer says, somewhat pompously, we exist at the interface
between history and geology.  Inevitably, things get buried,
intentionally or otherwise, become trapped in gradual or sudden tectonic
shifts, carried by water, overlaid, subducted.  In the course of
humanity’s short career entire cultures repeatedly blossom and vanish.
Archaeologists and palaeontologists, assiduously recording their
fragmentary finds, can merely scratch the surface, and the contents of
museums will always be exceeded by what remains undiscovered and for the
most part irretrievable. </P>

<P>The papers of Ryan Trench hint at a lost body of knowledge from a
time when our protohistorical record is virtually blank. Frustratingly,
we have not yet been able to establish the current whereabouts of the
artifacts he refers to in his sketches and photographs, but his notes
indicate that they were found some metres below the sea-bed off the
coast of Gujarat, not far from the Mul Dwarka excavations.  One of the
photographs shows a partially cleaned, flat circular metal plate above a
plastic scale indicating it to be about 20 centimetres in diameter.  He
does not identify the metal, but the cleaned area (the lower half) seems
to have a brassy sheen, and is inscribed with rows of regular
markings.</P>

<P>Another image shows the obverse of the same plate, where incised
lines form what I thought at first looked like a na&iuml;ve drawing of a
small train meeting a large hedgehog.  Each carriage has horizontal
bars, and the hedgehog is curled into a protective ball.  Altdorfer
suggested a rather interesting interpretation.</P>

<P>A third photograph shows an irregular encrustation of marine
organisms on what seems to be a cluster of eggs.  On the back, in Ryan’s
neat hand, he had written &quot;Vitreous!&quot;.  A detailed sketch of
one of the ‘eggs’ notes the thickness of the shell to be 2.3mm.  There
are also enlarged sketches of both sides of the metal plate, with a few
attempts at translation of some of the incised characters, mostly
crossed out.  Two words, however, have been emphatically encircled:
‘day’ and ‘enable’.  Even if only approximately correct, we suspect
these may help to explain the train and the hedgehog, and quite possibly
the eggs.</P>

<P>Among those unremembered creators of metal and glass another
forgotten genius had discovered a way to utilise electricity. Altdorfer
believes the train represents battery cells of some kind, and that the
hedgehog is a symbol either of the sun, or of a manufactured source of
heat and light.</P>

<P class=drop>Of Ryan Trench’s papers we have properly examined only the
first few in the topmost of the eleven box files.  In due course this
private archive will appear online, but for now we are still relishing
the luxury of our sneak preview.  So far, we have not encountered any
improved versions of board games, but who knows what else we will find
before Altdorfer’s aunt finishes her quilt?</P>
