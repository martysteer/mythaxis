<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mythaxis operates with a rolling submission window, only closing when a new issue is in production. <strong>Unless this page says otherwise, we are open for submissions!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We aim to acknowledge submissions the same day they are received. I<strong>f you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We aim to respond to submissions with a decision to accept or reject within 14 days of that date, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. <strong>If you do not hear from us after 30 days, please get in touch</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We are a paying market, but by necessity on a very modest scale. See below for current compensation details regarding short fiction and flash fiction pieces. When we are able to increase compensation for authors, you can rest assured we’ll be letting everyone know it.</p></li>
<li><p>For original fiction, we typically require <strong>First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity</strong> from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies, in event of which an additional full payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the authors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We do not currently invite reprint submissions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged</strong>. Put your work out there, as many places as you can! We merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible, to avoid our disappointment if someone else beats us to the punch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>COMPENSATION:</p>
<p><strong>Short Fiction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Length</strong>: 2,500-5,000 words. This is a firm limit. Generally speaking, the further a story goes beyond 5,000 words the more it will need to impress, but the door is not shut in advance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $10 on acceptance and return of contract.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flash Fiction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Length</strong>: 500-1,000 words. Tweener stories (1,000-2,500 words) will be considered, but we prefer flash to be short and sharp, so you best get whittling!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $5 on acceptance and return of contract.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>CONTENT GUIDELINES:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All submissions must be the original work of the author. We will not accept any work which incorporates copyrighted characters or material, fan fiction, tabletop-game adaptations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor is a lover of good storytelling. Whether you subscribe to “Hollywood” structuring, the beginning-middle-end philosophy, or some other narrative trend, all are welcome. By contrast, the less identifiable as “a story” your story is, the harder it will be to find a home here.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor is an appreciator of effective prose. This is something that changes from one story to the next, and what works for one won’t for another. However, what works for <em>all</em> is a minimum of clumsy typos, “creative” application of vocabulary, punctuation, and grammatical norms, and other annoyances. <em>Proofread before you submit</em>, or better still, <em>get someone else to</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mythaxis anticipates an adult readership in the sense of maturity, but this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content. “Artistic justification” is a good (if subjective) argument, and we shall (subjectively) assess each story according to its (subjective) merits.</p></li>
<li><p>We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds, be they cultural or personal, and submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences, provided they do not seek only to attack or demean those of others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>FORMATTING GUIDELINES:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceptable document types are RTF, DOC, or DOCX.</p></li>
<li><p>Straightforward manuscript formatting is preferred for editorial convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please use an easy-reading font (Times New Roman 12pt, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Do not manually insert empty lines between paragraphs, or use tabs for first-line indents. <strong>Use paragraph formatting</strong> to set automatic indents or paragraph breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a single centred # to represent essential section breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <em>italics</em> for italics, don’t underline instead. Smart (“curly”) punctuation is fine.</p></li>
<li><p>If your manuscript includes any unusual formatting, please alert the editors when submitting and have a really good, story-related reason.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Submissions should be anonymous</strong>, and do not require a cover page. Only include the story title, the word count, and the story text. Do not include the author’s name in or on the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Headers should contain the story title only. Footers should contain a page number only.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>HOW TO SUBMIT:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Email files as an attachment to <strong>andrew</strong>(dot)<strong>leon</strong>(dot)<strong>hudson</strong>(at)<strong>gmail</strong>(dot)<strong>com</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Use the email subject line: “<span id="__DdeLink__5_1519943571" class="anchor"></span>MYTHAXIS SUBMISSION – [STORY TITLE]”.</p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to include a short cover letter, though this is not mandatory. Any description of the story must be limited to 25 words for the editor’s amusement (impressive pitch descriptions will be appreciated, even though the story itself will sink or swim on its own merits).</p></li>
<li><p>A concise author biography is welcomed but not mandatory. If desired, introduce yourself and list your most recent (or proudest) publications, if any. Lacking a publication history is no impediment here. Mythaxis has embraced new authors and old, and will continue this tradition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We repeat: Please ensure your attachment is anonymous</strong>. Do not include the author’s name on the front page, headers or footers, or in the filename of the document.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the editor at the above address. We look forward to reading your work!</p>
