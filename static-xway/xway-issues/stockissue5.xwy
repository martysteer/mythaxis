[*BLURB] Sometimes, a Wall is Necessary

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Sunni Kiesha watched the night that monsters destroyed Tokyo, just
like the rest of the world had watched. Visions of a 1000 monster
movies come to life. She was shocked and appalled, and Sunni had to
admit somewhat fascinated, as millions had died in the short-lived
attack which had become known as The Incursion. Sunni 
was surprised by
how fast the Japanese authorities had reacted, and perhaps a little
shocked, given how little effort they made in saving lives in the
zone. Some even suggested they had acted too quickly as though they
could possibly have been complicit in events. Soldiers had gone in,
while at the same time a frantic wall had been thrown up
around the disaster zone. Sunni had read how a decision was made as to
how things might progress and where a line could be drawn most
productively. She had watched footage of army helicopters dropping
prefabricated partitions into place, the components of a wall, a
proposed last line of defence. Though, in the end, they had never had
to find out whether it would have held.

<div class=lpullquote>A
grey-skinned shambling form, limping and broken.</div>
Nevertheless, with the incursion ended, they had added to the wall - for
security and containment reasons. Always with the reasoning that they
were never sure what had brought the attack to an end, or what might
trigger a second such event. While in some ways it was justified as a
memorial, the names of the dead who had been identified carved in its
surface, a sight that Sunni longed to see for herself. One successful
shot had been fired; the smallest of monsters had made the furthest
advance, the greater beasts gorging on the population in her wake. A
grey-skinned shambling form, limping and broken. Before any order
could be given a soldier had fired, instinct and training kicking in
during the face of disaster. Her head snapped back, a red circle
formed like some holy mark on her forehead, before her skull
shattered and she died, an aura of blood splashed outward. She had
turned out to be human - Lei Bliley - subject of an experimental
program. A regrettable mistake, the authorities explained, though Sunni
had her doubts. Whether this program Lei had been part of, whatever it
was, was connected to the appearance of the beasts and the death of
the multitude had never been confirmed. But, Sunni had her thoughts,
and there were plenty of theories; people always had theories, and the
TV, the newspapers and the internet had been full of them, even
now, two years later. The correspondence between Lei's death and the ending
of The Incursion was just too great a coincidence.

A lucky photographer had caught the image, which had become iconic. He
had been arrested at the time; in the next few days exclusive
interviews were published detailing how badly treated he had been and
Sunni had read them all. But he had sent the image on instantly, and
it was out there, and no amount of
beatings would bring it back. So that moment where the red flower blossomed on Lei's head,
those intense alien red eyes were caught, a snapshot, before there was
nothing left to recognise. That image had spread round the world; it
had been in all the papers. Then it had become a poster, a t-shirt, a stencil for the spray artists on urban streets. Sunni 
was one of so many of her
generation obsessed by Lei, obsessed with The Incursion. The poster of
that shot had been hanging on her wall for so long, that face looking
down on her every night. The Incursion had happened on Sunni's
birthday. She had turned 21 that day, a birthday she would never
forget, as the ripple of news spread and she had taken it all on board.

The Japanese government had been desperate to crush all information.
They had even gone so far as to shoot down a press helicopter that had
flown over the zone. Soldiers had stormed the agencies of the major
media corporations. But that was an old fashioned and naïve response.
The flow of news was instantaneous. A shot taken was a shot
distributed. After the material had been transmitted from the
unfortunate helicopter crew there had  been limited official footage.
But the blogosphere had erupted - instant messaging systems, social
networking, photo hosting - distributed from mobile phones and pocket
computers, sent through a network that had stayed remarkably resilient
even as those on the ground met their demise so soon after contributing to
the documentation that survived them.

After Lei had been shot, the event ended and the wall thrown up,
no-one ever went looking for survivors and no emergency aid was ever
delivered. If there was anyone left alive in central Tokyo they were
on their own, this was one of the things which always amazed Sunni,
how could they do nothing? Under a state of emergency, with a
population too shocked to argue, this was just accepted. The
government made it clear in the first, limited, official statement - it
would be impossible to ever count how many people had died, though there 
was no doubt it was in the millions, just as - the spokesperson said - there
were no survivors. There could be no survivors.

At last it was clear, mankind was not alone. Quite what the creatures
had been was uncertain - aliens who had stepped through a portal from
some abysmal planet to ours, or Lovecraftian demons who had torn
through the fabric of the dimensions or something else entirely - the
result was the same. We are not alone. Sunni was fired up by this
thought, and she was not alone. Joining message boards which studied
The Incursion, she found plenty of like-minded people. Footage was
posted and collected, everything that they could get from that night.
Then they went further - Lei Bliley became their figurehead - while her
true story remained shrouded by secrets, hackers had penetrated any
information system they could, which primarily lead to a collection of
clips of this strange and lonely woman shambling through the streets
of Tokyo. With time they could even identify those suited men who had
followed her everywhere that she went, keeping at a distance but
always there. As with Lei, information about these men was scarce,
even though names had been found for some of them.

<p class=drop>Sunni had been saving her money for months now. She was determined to
visit Tokyo. To see the sites of the Incursion for herself. A notion
that wasn't as isolated as one might have suspected in the first days
after the event. The Great Wall of Tokyo had become a major tourist
attraction. Coming up for the second anniversary, coming up
for Sunni's 23rd birthday, she finally had enough money. A lot of people from the board 
were going to be there; at last she was going
to meet her friends.

Tonight was the second annual World's End Party Night. Sunni had
obtained a ticket, they all had, and they were all here after months of
planning and organisation. Though Sunni was shy, she was doing her
best to mix, to talk to those people she knew so well from the screen
- but the screen and flesh are such different endeavours. Many of them
were wearing various t-shirts with Lei's face, some were wearing
t-shirts with pictures of the various monsters (they all had their
favourite beasts). Sunni was wearing the souvenir t-shirt that she had
bought from a stall by the Great Wall, where she had gone on the day
that she had arrived in the city. It said in bold letters, and in
different languages:

<h3>CAUTION: YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE HUMAN ZONE.</h3>

Despite the fact that the zone was shut off from the public, the
authorities still accessed it. Studying the zone, trying to learn as
much as they could from what was left, in case there was ever another
attack. But they had also found fragments of alien materials, strange
new metals which had been recreated in small amounts. Somehow brave
souls entered the zone under cover of night, looking for artefacts of
their own that they could sell on the black market. These explorers
were called Stalkers, it was a reference that came from the Russian
novel "A Roadside Picnic", which all the board members had read, and
had later been made into a film named after the explorers, and which the board
members had all seen. They speculated whether the Incursion zone
actually bore any resemblance to what was seen in the film in the same
way in which they speculated about everything else. But they knew it didn't.
The hotels and tourist locations round the wall had viewing platforms
- everyone could see the horrid and brutalised structures that
remained standing. Columns of steel, the shattered remains of
skyscrapers, stumps left standing amongst the ashes.

In fact, the club they are in now is one of those that has been built
specially with a view of the zone, one of a number of buildings built
or adapted to take advantage of their location. Some are luxury
hotels, where the suites with a view of the zone demand the highest
price. There is also a rotating tower where, at the top, diners in the
exclusive restaurant spin slowly, each with their own momentary view
of the zone - the late night sittings being most particularly in
demand. This club is a rougher establishment with its electro angst
music playing, pounding dirge music that had become popular in the
wake of The Incursion - electro dance music, stripped and sparse with
an end of the world sentiment, which some described as somewhat
Gothic. Though certainly tickets for entry had not been cheap either,
for all the contrived image of the establishment. Sunni knows all the
tracks, and sings the words to herself, her attention torn between the
sight of everyone dancing and the view of the zone that one can see
through the great windows on that side of the building. At the moment
blasting strobes play across the room and big screens show cut up
mixes of monster footage. Pieces from the real event, mixed with
artistic representations and reinterpretations. Though Sunni knows
that these will shut off when the real show starts. The nightly
spectacle that provides a constant reminder of events past.


Sunni doesn't feel entirely well, if truth be told. For a moment the
lights make her feel dizzy, she blinks and clutches at her necklace.
The alien artefact seems to offer her some kind of reassurance. 

<p class=drop>The first thing she did when she arrived in the city was to visit the
wall. To see the commemorative plaque, the list of names that had been
accounted for, and the bustle of stalls and stands catering to
tourists. From postcards and t-shirts, to various fast-food stalls
selling noodles to all those who visited. Sunni picked out her
favourite images of post-incursion Tokyo and bought them as postcards to
send to friends back home. She wrote while drinking green tea in the
memorial garden tea rooms. She bought a carton of steaming hot
noodles, ate them with disposable chopsticks while wandering through
the bustle. Here Sunni found a stall claiming to sell genuine alien
artefacts, she didn't believe they were real Stalkers, but the thrill
of possibly being able to buy a genuine alien article was too much for
her to resist. The makeshift stall didn't particularly reassure her,
but she picked a green rock on a string and gave the man her money. No
sooner had she done so than a second man appeared to tell the first
that a police patrol was on its way, and Sunni watched with surprise as
the stall was quickly packed away and the two men retreated in the other
direction. She stuffed her purchase in her pocket and tried to look as
innocent as possible as a group of militaristic officers worked past
her, scanning the market with every step. The illegal nature of the
wares now seemed to be verified, though perhaps that just added to the
theory that she had been ripped off?

Visiting Tokyo is a much more intense experience than Sunni had
expected. While the locals seem to go about their lives as normally as
possible, it is hard to deny the psychic imprint that lies on the
city. Sunni feels that she can sense the catastrophic death everywhere
she goes, as if it were a palpable sensation. Being in the city she feels
that she can hear the voices of the dead in her head, a constant and
unsettling presence. She can't sleep properly, fevered dreams wake her
every night; it seems as though her head is full of the words of alien
languages. As she goes round the city the sensation of unease only
increases. Some of them discussed this earlier on in the evening, she is
not the only one to feel this way. But then, as someone says, they have
all done their tours - The Great Wall and associated market, the
memorial gardens, the grave of Lei Bliley and the Museum of Incursion.
The museum documents events - photos of that night, statistics and
displays detailing how many people had died, before and after models
of the city, documentation of the cancer spikes and sicknesses that
affected those in the proximity of the zone on the night of The
Incursion. With such a dreadful history, and with such a sensitivity
to events, how could Sunni not feel an impact?

<p class=drop>Sunni swears she can hear voices now. A real sensation, clearer than
the spectral impressions she has experienced so far. The screaming of
the dead. The words of that unsettling language that cause such
discomfort. She shivers, reaches out to the glass of the window for
support, its surface cold against the palm of her hands. Music
thunders and pumps, and she feels like her head does as well. Through
it all there is one clear voice, a woman's voice, speaking those
dreadful words. Sunni has this impression, the voice, it belongs to
Lei, it makes no sense, but right now its the only thing that seems to
be logical in any way. Then the music stops. The strobe lights stop.
The screens switch to a live view of the zone. It is time. There is a
buzz of anticipation. This is what people come to Tokyo to see more
than anything. This inexplicable sight. This constant reminder that
has occurred every night since The Incursion. Looking down on the zone
they can see the neon coils of alien tentacles, wraith-like things.
Then the shambling shapes of horrors that tower over the city that
was. Spectres endlessly re-enacting the night the monsters destroyed
Tokyo. Events with a sufficient impact leave their mark on reality,
some say, this is one explanation for ghosts. It is one of the most
prevalent theories as to what happens here every night. The
insubstantial shapes that light up the sky, a show more spectacular
and mind-bending than any special effects studio ever cooked up.
Watching such a spectacle, many are left feeling that it is hard to
believe that the end days are not in fact imminent and that humanity's
days in the cold void of space are not numbered.

Sunni, and so many around her, watch this event, startled by the
actuality, even though this is why they are here, now, on the second
anniversary of The Incursion. This is what they have talked about for
so long. This is what they have watched online videos of, now they are
here to see it for themselves. Sunni stands with her mouth open.
People press around her, and she is conscious of them taking pictures,
she is conscious that some of them are talking to her. But dealing
with her own emotions is enough to take up her entire attention. She
is amazed. She is appalled. She is nauseous. There is only one voice
in her head now.

Lei blinks again, confused, looking down on the wretched ruin of her
city. Sunni shakes, a cold spasm through her body, feeling disembodied
momentarily, disconnected from herself and detached from the horror.
She touches the necklace round her neck. The strange green rock. <i>What
is this?</i> Lei wonders. Warm in her hand, its surface seemingly
unstable. Sunni turns her back to the outside view, leans back against
the glass, closes her eyes. Sunni is feeling weak, as though her legs
could fail her at any moment. She feels the object at her throat, and
tugs it, breaking the cord. At this moment she is convinced - this is
absolutely an alien artefact she has been sold, that she has been
carrying with her for the last few days. She is too weak to throw it
away, sliding to the floor, wondering how many others in this room
also bought artefacts as souvenirs from unscrupulous stalls by the
wall?

Lei looks around the room. The view is confusing. She can see herself.
Lei is standing by the bar. Lei is standing on the dance floor. Lei is
holding Lei's hand. Sunni shudders, <i>what is going on?</i> Lei tells her
not to worry. Lei tells her it will be ok. Lei says that the Chairman
is back, the Chairman has returned to harvest his seed. There are
people in the club screaming. Sunni listens to the voices and tries to
make sense of what is happening, listens to the voice and fails to
comprehend. There are people in the club running for the exits. Sunni
watches those who move, and those like her who are caught up in this
internal dialogue. This time, she tells Sunni, this time there will be
no survivors. And Sunni hears the sound of glass breaking all around
her, as Lei stands and a grotesque tentacle cleaves through the room.

[*ITEM] His Fly Undid Him

[*AUTHOR] Matthew Kirshenblatt

[*BLURB] Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting 
convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day. - <b>Bertrand Russell.</b>

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>It's a short story. As short as the lives
of the flies that my friend liked to kill, but not too short to
demonstrate the consequences thereof.

So, yes, my friend liked to kill flies.

Dan lived in a broken down old apartment building where the walls were
peeling, the carpet managed to smell like dog without even the presence
of a canine, and the plates and utensils in his rusting kitchen and
bathroom sinks were classified under the term "scrubbing optional."

As for Dan, he was a dumpy guy that managed to remain greasy a lot of
the time, when he was incredibly scruffy and wearing the stereotypical
grunge to go along with it all. Don't get me wrong. Appearances aside,
he was an otherwise good man who liked to play World of Warcraft, could
tell the most entertaining stories of how he was fictitiously laid after
a few beers, and had a genocidal compulsion against flies.

I'm still puzzled about it to this very day. I mean, you would think
with all the filth he accumulated, Dan would have been more tolerant of
his nonhuman neighbors in the inevitable ecosystem he created for
himself. And indeed, he had no problem with the earwigs, and even the
spiders. No, he had no problem with the spiders at all.

You see, Dan liked to kill flies in a variety of ways. Sometimes, he
would just use a basic Swiss-hole flyswatter. Other times, he would just
spray them. This was just a matter of course really. Then, he just got
nasty. Dan owned a BB gun. I would be hard-pressed to tell you now what
model it was, considering I never really had one, but it was one that
shot out hard, multicolored pellets. Sometimes, as we were gaming on our
laptops, he would reach over and, before anything, he would shoot a fly
in midair. Sometimes, he would even get a few shots off, which annoyed
me because sometimes the pellets just whizzed over my head or brushed my
cheek.

<div class=pullquote>I was really philosophical at that point. Well, as philosophical as any drunk
gets at two in the morning.</div>But no matter how many times I swore at him, he would just not stop. And
you can say a lot about my friend, but he was an excellent shot. There
were pieces of fly limbs scattered everywhere under the bright paint of
those pellets. Those, and the others, however, were the lucky ones. I
won't even go into the ones that were not always killed instantly. The
ones that had their wings shattered, or their legs ripped off.

Sometimes, I suspect that he honestly trapped some of them in the window
screen and literally watched their strength slowly ebb away. That was, of
course, when he didn't feed them, or remnants of them, to the spiders that
he kept in the corners. One time, I asked him why he did it. I'm not
sure I remember, but I do think it was something to do with the noise
that they made. The buzzing sound. Something in the vibrational tone of
these insects bothered Dan so much that it moved him to specific acts of
cruelty towards them. Now, I don't like the sound of flies either. Their
droning reminds me too much of wasps and hornets - insects I don't know
if I'm allergic to and otherwise do not want to find out.

But even I started to feel really sorry for them, and found this
compulsion almost weirder than Renfield's eating habits from Dracula. I
even told him that maybe if he cleaned his place up more, there would be
less of them. But according to Dan, it was clean enough. The waxy
pale flypaper on the walls, with its macabre trophies, was supposed to be
a testament to this. And besides, he claimed that he should be able to
keep his place any damn way he wanted and that he was the one who
suffered everything else in it to live. He would just not, as he put it,
suffer flies.

Now, I didn't go there often and only when I was stranded at night when
the buses stopped, or we came back from a particularly strenuous game of
D&D. To be honest, I couldn't stand the place. There was something
really bad aside from the smell of ass and antiseptics. I couldn't
really express it then.

Then, there was the night.

We'd been gaming and drinking a lot. I crashed on the couch while Dan
went into his room. As tired as I was, I couldn't get to sleep. I was
really philosophical at that point. Well, as philosophical as any drunk
gets at two in the morning. There actually was a full moon shining from
one of the windows. The white light from the view was probably one of
the few beautiful things about that place. It was actually really
bright. We'd turned the other lights off, and I just lay there thinking
about stuff.

My thoughts were not very original, as semi-inebriated musings go. I
wondered about souls. About death. I thought about how we knew that we
had souls. Or was it that we were just machines that would blink off the
moment our hearts -- our sources of power faded and turned off and parts
fell apart? Much like the flies that Dan killed. Descartes, a
philosopher almost always quoted when someone is at least somewhat
wasted, said that animals were just machines that acted on
pre-programmed impulses and could not feel pain or anything. He said
they were soulless things.

I was as skeptical about that pyjama-wearing Frenchman's delusions as I
was about that soulless vampire bullshit in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Then I started thinking about ghosts and other stuff we touched on at
our friend's when were role-playing. My last thought was something along
the lines of just how much flypaper was on the walls, and how many small
bodies were stuck onto the pale white substance forever.

I'm not sure if I woke before, or after I heard the sound. It was a low,
but reverberating sound. My teeth were vibrating from it. The windows
from the outside were still white with the moon, but the light seemed to
be swirling around on the walls.

Or so I thought.

I was very disoriented from waking up so soon and I was sure as hell
that I was somewhat under the influence. To this day, I hope that it was
the alcohol whose influence I found myself under.

The walls were squirming. Pulsing really. Maybe it was a trick of the
light or very bad vision on my part. But what was really disturbing was
the black bits on the fly paper walls. I could have sworn they were
twitching. Underneath dust, paint and stickiness they moved like one
great organism. In the moonlight, they were all pale and slowly, they
began to extract themselves from the wall. I wish this delusion rivaling
an LSD trip ended there.

But it got worse.

Accompanied by a white powdery mist, mangled fly parts joined the mass
from the wall. The moon robbed them of any colour other than the one it
gave them. They crawled from under the screen, and the corners, and the
garbage, and even the sink and the bathroom -- where I strongly suspect
Dan drowned them. They all molded together like never-born maggots, or a
cocoon of death until this malformed shape of multiple broken wings, and
twisted limbs, and dead insect eyes, and powder, and hurt buzzed
ominously and slowly away from me.

Like an undead Zerg Overlord, it hovered like an ivory pustule of small
horror and pain and floated across the room.

To Dan's room.

I was on the couch when I woke up the next day. My head was aching and
it took a while for my eyes to focus in the really bright sunlight. And
then I screamed.

You would have too. The place was almost entirely clean. Too damn clean.
The fly bodies were all gone. All of them. The wax paper wasn't even on
the walls anymore.

But that wasn't what really scared me. What really scared me was the
white powder coating everything, with greater parts of it in the centre
of the room ... and in the line trailing to Dan's doorway.

They never found Dan. And I got as far away from that apartment building
as I could. I'd heard all about things like ectoplasm as psychic
residue, and poltergeists and places as things being charged with the
collective energies of people who died especially violent deaths. These
things could pool together and sometimes, apparently, gain something not
unlike sentience or intent. What I didn't know was that the same
principles could also be applied to nonhuman lives. To animals. To
insects.

To this very day, whenever I get a fly in my room, I put it on a Kleenex
and throw it out of my door to go elsewhere. I literally will not, and
cannot hurt a fly again. I won't hurt a fly because they know us. They
know our homes, our food, our garbage, and our shit.

Beelzebub. The Lord of the Flies.

I could go on, but I won't.

[*ITEM] The Extrusion Project

[*AUTHOR] Grant McDonald Walker

[*BLURB] Who knows what problems the Large Hadron Collider will cause?

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Faithful-2 Astrophysicist Bracle awoke in a
foul mood. With a slap of his fourth tentacle, he expelled from his
sleeping nook the young female with whom he had spent an energetic
night. She fled gratefully to her own mate's quarters, nursing bruises
and contusions. Bracle had scientific matters to consider, and reports
to edit. Although it was not true, he really felt that the extrusion was
his own discovery. He was a senior astrophysicist in the exploration
vessel Pilgrim-4545676, which carried some 200 scientists and 500
clergy. It was not Bracle, but a junior astronomer, who had first
spotted the extrusion amid a strong source of dark matter. Bracle had,
by the strength of his authority and certain threats, seized a prior
claim. 

Most scientists now believed that the vast majority of dark matter was a
leakage from another dimension. Dark matter was one of the great
mysteries, accounting for much of the mass of the universe, but spread
thinly over all of space, rather than concentrated in stars and planets
where it could easily be seen and measured. The majority of the matter
discovered tended to be individual atoms of hydrogen 2.5, which quickly
decomposed into ordinary hydrogen with a brief spray of fundamental
particles and a little energy. Very occasionally, concentrations of
simple compounds of hydrogen 2.5 such as "heavy ammonia" or "heavy
methane" appeared in deep space, and remained stable. These
concentrations tended to be a few thousand molecules, almost invisible,
resembling frost crystals.

The extrusion, by contrast, was in a totally different order of
magnitude, an ordered cluster of long-chain polymers, millions of
molecules bonded together in curves, clearly visible to the naked eye,
and it was growing in intersecting layers. There was still some dispute
as to whether it was debris from an unknown spaceship, it was so regular
in shape, but the way in which it seemingly appeared from nowhere, and
the fact that every hydrogen atom in it seemed to be Hydrogen 2.5,
confirmed that it was dark matter in a hitherto unknown form.

<div class=pullquote>His third tentacle ached from the blow he had delivered to his
adversary's beak yesterday</div>However, all the scientists on the ship were here under the auspices of
the Church of Continuous Creation, a wealthy religious sect who believed
that God (the twelve-tentacled creator of the universe) could be
discovered performing His creation if you searched hard enough, and they
had financed and equipped this and many other scientific expeditions to
investigate hotspots of creation, of which the current locus was one.
The priests had taken intellectual ownership of The Dark Extrusion, as
they called it, and forbidden further scientific tests on it, arguing
that its closeness to God's creation rendered it a holy object for
veneration only. Their belief was that as the universe expanded, God
created an atom of Hydrogen 2.5 every so often in order to retain the
overall density of matter. So far as provable fact went, to tell the
truth, it was as valid a theory as any, but Bracle was keen to discover
a more scientific basis for matter creation. He was also keen to
establish a reputation for himself.	At all costs. Especially if the
costs were being paid by others.

Despite his eminence as a scientist, Bracle was ranked a mere
Faithful-2, and that rank was conferred only as a result of his fudging
his answers to the Church's faith test. In this, he was not alone among
the scientists aboard. No-one below Faithful-2 level was permitted on
these holy expeditions, so one had to pretend belief to participate in
them. In fact, his personal beliefs were close to atheism. As far as
Bracle and most of his scientific colleagues were concerned, there was a
scientific reason for everything, including dark matter. 

Bracle had expressed his views rather forcefully at the supper trough,
striking a junior colleague in his fury, and he had to hurry from his
bunk this morning to appear before a six-person Church Committee. An
attendant in the corridor had informed him that The Committee had
already issued a death sentence and a maiming this morning. Bracle's own
minor crimes, last night's assault and a possible, but unsubstantiated,
allegation of rape from the reluctant mate of his chief assistant,
Adafle, would be unlikely to attract any penalty of that severity, but
an accusation of heresy might conceivably be more forcefully punished.
His third tentacle ached from the blow he had delivered to his
adversary's beak yesterday, another limb was bleeding slightly as a
result of a fresh bite from last night's bed companion, and he was seeing
triple and quadruple because his eye-stalks were weary after the long
night of intoxicating vapours and sexual activities. As a result of
these discomforts , Bracle's rashness level was at a high today, and it
was only the risk of heresy that dissuaded him from displaying a more
arrogant attitude to the Church Committee.

"What impels you to deny the divine nature of the Dark Extrusion?" asked
Chairman Rawale, a wrinkled oldster with a twitch in his eighth
tentacle, who sat at the centre of the nest array.

A sudden flush of exasperation impelled Bracle to reply, "It seems to me
that God may be behind this at some remove, but I find it difficult to
believe that He would manifest His power by producing an artifact made
of plastic. I would expect God's creations to be more elegant and
complete in form, like a flower or a conscious being, and to be constructed of a
variety of materials, rather than translucent polyethylene."

There was a brief silence as The Committee absorbed this idea, followed
by the predictable priestly response: "Who are you to judge His
ineffable wisdom?" from the sycophantic Dandle, an effluent-licking
younger priest whose utterances seldom strayed from accepted dogma.
Grunts of approval from the other inquisitors greeted this banal
rhetorical query.

Bracle didn't attempt to answer the question directly. "I accept that
this is an unusual source of matter. Unique, in fact. Most strong
sources of dark matter are rather randomly distributed and sporadic in
output. With this one, as well as a high concentration of conventional
dark matter atoms and simple compounds, there is the so-called extrusion
orbiting a minor black hole at a distance of 800 light-heartbeats, which
is interestingly unusual. But we have to recognise that this source is
located in what has to be described as a rather out-of-the-way corner of
a conventional spiral galaxy, hardly the location in which the Deity
would choose to reveal the Majesty of His creation. I feel sure that
while God may well have set up the conditions for this phenomenon to
occur, we would honour Him greatly by <I>studying</I> the extrusion in
addition to, obviously, venerating it."

Some of the committee members shifted uncomfortably; eye-stalks turned
towards Chairman Rawale. And Bracle delivered his master stroke: "And
if, indeed, the Dark Extrusion does come directly from God, then surely
he will have written a message for us upon it with his own tentacle. But
it may not be easy to read. We must inspect it very closely, visually,
chemically and topologically." 

Further unrest and some whispering ensued within the six-person
committee. Dandle was heard to say something about trickery, and was
hushed by the rather formal Gossle, whom Bracle rather liked.
Eventually, with a clearing of beaks, they appeared to reach a
conclusion. Chairman Rawale stated the ruling: "You may study the
artifact as closely as you wish; photograph it with reflected, not
artificial, light; you may not touch it or permit it to be touched; you
may not bombard it with electromagnetic rays. Is that clear?" 

"Certainly, Chairman." Bracle did not feel it politic to report that the
extrusion had already been photographed and X-rayed by a robot drone,
which had also chopped off a small nodule and brought it back for
analysis. Its identification as simple polythene had been made from that
sample, though other organic compounds were also present, lying on the
surface of the plastic.

But Committee Member Jowle had obviously been thinking about that. "What
makes you so sure that the extrusion is made of polythene?" he asked.

"Spectral analysis," replied Bracle, hoping that no-one in the nest had
the experience to ask supplementary questions. To complicate the issue,
he hastily added, "To call the substance of the extrusion 'polythene' is
an over-simplification. Various organic compounds have been observed in
its composition, but most are describable as ethylene chains or rings,
such as are found in plastics."

"Further," continued Chairman Rawale, "The Committee is assigning
Moderaror Dandle to your team to ensure that appropriate respect is paid
to the manifestation."

Bracle groaned inwardly whilst making a polite salute to Dandle.
"Welcome, Moderator Dandle." he managed to say. Life was about to become
more frustrating if that sanctimonious nit-picker was on his team. But
overall it could have been worse. As well as the power of death, maiming
and life, Chairman Rawale had the power to forbid any scientific
activity at all. At least it hadn't come to that. And no-one had
mentioned his recent violent conduct.


<p class=drop>In a scrupulously clean but cluttered laboratory, a couple
of kilometres below the Swiss countryside, Eric Peterson prepared
another run of his experiment at twenty past two in the morning, one of
the few timeslots available on the vast particle accelerator. It seemed
that the smaller the commodity being studied, the larger the equipment
required to study it, and the more people interested in doing so. 

<div class=lpullquote>When
atomic nuclei collide at high speed, showers of sub-particles are
briefly detectable, some of which are suspected of having a component in
another dimension.</div>In this case, various sub-atomic particles were being fired twenty-six
kilometres down a tunnel, accelerating all the way, and arriving at the
tiny target area travelling at nearly three hundred thousand kilometres
a second. At that speed, the impacts of these particles on any atoms
that got in the way was considerable. Eric was causing these particles
to zap into a plastic beaker full of a sort of chemical soup of Eric's
own devising. In this way, Eric hoped to prove that actual biological life could be initiated
by the bombardment of inorganic solutions with high speed elementary
particles. In this attempt, he was mirroring similar experiments
performed by Miller et al using electricity and ultraviolet as the
trigger. The partial success of these previous experiments in creating
amino acids and proteins had given scientists the confidence that, in
due course, some form of life might be created artificially. However,
without some kind of boost, it might take time. Years, millennia, eons
even. In point of fact, Creationists and other Bible-thumpers could point to the fact that
after nearly a hundred years of trying, not even a smart bacterium had 
been created by artificial means. 

Of course, the vast accelerator wasn't built for Eric's project. Hence,
all Eric's time slots were in the early hours of the morning, and his
slots were often cancelled because of maintenance or because a more
important user had overrun. Really Important Research into elementary
particle theory was the main thrust of the accelerator's purpose. When
atomic nuclei collide at high speed, showers of sub-particles are
briefly detectable, some of which are suspected of having a component in
another dimension. Apparently, some particles which theory argued
<b>should</b> be present had continued to evade detection and everyone
was becoming a little worried about the millions spent on the
accelerator's construction and maintenance.

So far, Eric's results had been disappointing, too. Amino acids and proteins
were appearing in unprecedented quantities under the beam of very fast
particles, but he had been hoping for something more interesting than
the simple organic compounds he was seeing, which were similar to those
which previous experiments seemed to have produced. He had expected that
by increasing the intensity of bombardment well beyond natural levels,
he might produce primitive life somewhat more quickly than God, or even Mother Nature,
had done. 

While nuclei collided in his beaker under the particle beam, Eric was
analysing a sample of a previous batch of Life Soup at a nearby bench.
Even a total failure can win you a PhD as long as you get enough details
into the thesis. He was interrupted when Bruno, lab assistant and
general fusspot, walked into the lab and immediately yelled at him,
"Hey, Mr. Peterson, your container is leaking all over my target
platform!" 

This was a gross exaggeration, but some of the precious liquid was,
indeed, dribbling from the bottom of the beaker. Eric reached for the
vessel as Bruno had the presence of mind to switch off the beam.
"Idiot!," Bruno shouted, "You nearly cooked your stupid hand in the beam
just now! And get that slime bucket into the sink before we are all
having to swim for it!" 

Since the contents of the beaker represented some weeks of work, Eric
quickly transferred the soup to one of the sterile bottles in which batches
of Life Soup were stored when not actually being irradiated. 

"Thanks, Bruno. Hey, look at how thin the bottom of this beaker is,"
Eric said, feeling he should make some excuse for the leak.

"It was your responsibility to obtain and check the container," replied
Bruno, taking it from Eric and poking at the thin polythene, "But it is
certainly defective. You must obtain another one."

"Yes, of course."

"Now you must, please, go away while I clean up your mess."

"I'll do it. It was my..."

"This is my responsibility, Mr. Peterson. My laboratory is more than surgically
clean. The air is filtered. There is not so much as a fly in here, and
it is because I am extremely thorough in a way that a scientist like you
can never be. Do you want the place overrun with vermin? No, you do not.
You might think you had created them yourself. Ha?" Bruno was still
laughing at his own joke after Eric had left with his defective
container.

<p class=drop>Bracle's principal problem was not the complex space-borne scientific
endeavour on which he was engaged, nor the increasing resentment he was
causing by his continual exercise of <I>droit de seigneur</I> over
colleagues' mates, but the interference from the irritating priest,
Dandle, whose eyes were everywhere and whose tentacles were into
everything. Had Dandle been a mere service person, or even a fellow
scientist of inferior rank, Bracle could have had him removed from the
project, or even from the land of the living, if necessary. Such was not
the case with the ubiquitous Dandle, whose membership of the priesthood
rendered him immune to deliberate harm of any kind, on pain of the
assailant's death. Observation of The Dark Extrusion was constantly hampered
by prolonged debates with Dandle as to whether even seeing the
phenomenon by natural starlight constituted a violation of The
Committee's restrictions. Whether, specifically, impact by stellar
photons violated the stricture against bombardment by electromagnetic
waves. Quantum dynamics, for example, a discipline with which Dandle had
scant familiarity, and Bracle could claim little more facility, was
called into play, necessitating much delay, during which time no
investigation could take place. Further disputes arose over the
placement of radiation detectors and positional radio beacons, which
Bracle considered to be basic requirements. Did the radiation detectors
in any way affect the extrusion? No. On the contrary, it was eventually
agreed that the extrusion potentially affected the detectors. Did the
radio beacons in any way affect the extrusion? Yes, but in an allowable
manner under the terms of The Committee's embargo. This and other
pettifogging disagreements required The Committee to reconvene, each
event costing precious days.

Dandle was aware of, even gleeful at, Bracle's frustration, and familiar
with his reputation for violence. He was, therefore, careful never to be
alone with Bracle. When the scientific team made a spacewalk to inspect
the extrusion at close range, Dandle's space suit developed a mysterious
slow leak near one of the tentacle joints, but Dandle quickly repaired
the puncture using a self-adhesive patch with which he had thoughtfully
provided himself for the trip. A suit safety officer was condemned to
death for endangering the valuable cleric. On another occasion, a
mis-labelled airlock control unexpectedly expelled the intrepid Dandle into space,
where he might have orbited the centre of the universe for ever, had he
not been secured to the hull with a safety line. An airlock safety
officer suffered amputation of a tentacle and an eyestalk for
carelessness on that occasion.

Dandle's oppressive presence was removed in quite an unexpected and
helpful manner. On the thirty-fourth cycle of investigation, a new layer
of matter started to appear, a layer that was red in colour. Shortly
thereafter, strange markings were observed on the otherwise smoothly
curved section of the extrusion. The Reverend Dandle forthwith banished
the excited scientists from the area, and proudly led a group of
incongruously space-suited priests to the location.It had, for some time, 
been observed that changes in the extrusion took
place in regular bursts about 140,000 heartbeats apart, and that they
were accompanied by an increase in radiation, a fact confirmed by the
recently installed radiation detectors. Dandle chose a time of maximum
activity for his party, and strayed into a volume of space which was
apparently filled with very fast particles and very hard radiation.
Dandle was simultaneously freeze-dried and microwaved to a crisp inside
a space suit that had suddenly become porous.

At Dandle's funeral feast, some diners remarked that he was far too well
done and dry for their taste, and that they much preferred a freshly
executed heretic to a spoiled priest. Chairman Rawale found it necessary
to rebuke the complainers, remarking that the quality of the deceased's
life was more to be celebrated than the quality of his meat. It was
observed, however, that even Rawale found it difficult to eat more than
a few scraps of tentacle.

The rather humourless Moderator Gossle was assigned to the team in
Dandle's place, but he turned out to be more pragmatic and much easier to work with than
his predecessor. The investigation proceeded with more despatch than
before. It seemed very likely that the raised markings on the extrusion
were writing in some form or another, but they remained
incomprehensible, despite long and careful study. 

It was during an attempt to make a cast of the writing that a remarkable
discovery was made. The cast was successfully applied to a portion of
the extrusion, but, when it set, it proved difficult to remove.
Eventually, grapples were attached to the cast, and considerable force
applied by towing it with a rocket-powered service vehicle. The whole
red part of the extrusion twisted and suddenly almost doubled in size.
The effect was as though it had been inflated, but study of a video
later demonstrated that the additional volume had been pulled out of
nowhere, as though it had been concealed in some invisible, intangible
pocket in space. Bracle was the first to correctly conclude that the
extrusion lay mostly in another dimension, and he proposed that there
might be very much more substance available if a really good pull were
organised.

The suggestion was vetoed by Chairman Rawale, who was already in a state
of reverential shock and awe at what had happened. The Chairman declared
that he required some days to meditate upon its significance.

<p class=drop>"It is now apparent," said Bruno, "That the particle beam
is destroying your containers. There is daily leakage of fluid  from
your messy experiment."

"Not today, Bruno. I bought a very substantial red plastic bucket from
the Co-op supermarket."

"I see that, Mr Peterson, but it is already becoming porous, you see!
There is a wetness on the outside of the bucket."

As they contemplated the experiment, the bucket suddenly lurched, a
split appeared in it, and its contents spilled out. Eric gave a groan of
horror which was drowned by Bruno's howl of rage. On inspection, the
bottom of the bucket had been eroded to a wafer-thin shell and part of
it had disappeared altogether. Bruno cleaned up the mess with many complaints, insisting that, in
future, Eric should use glass or metal vessels, but Eric wasn't
listening. It had dawned upon Eric that he had here a very interesting
phenomenon indeed. 

Over the next few sessions, Eric abandoned his Life Soup, placing only
various solid substances in the beam. One, a celluloid ping-pong ball,
vanished completely in four seconds; assorted other plastic substances
were eroded to an extent; metal, glass, stone, paper, flesh (a pork
chop), rubber, wood and ivory (a key from a scrapped pianoforte) were
either unaffected or were physically damaged by the high energy beam,
melting or burning as the case may be.

Only plastics, especially polythene, exhibited the disappearing
behaviour. To confirm actual disappearance, Eric placed a plastic toy in
a hermetically sealed glass container, and weighed it before and after
irradiation. Afterwards, the container appeared empty, and was lighter
by the weight of the toy, a plastic jeep.

Using a supply of thick plastic rods from Bruno's supply cupboard, Eric
also discovered that if he switched off the beam before the rod had
completely disappeared, and he then pulled it in the direction the beam
came from, then some or all of the rod would often reappear. Setting up
a careful bracket and stand apparatus, he further found that if the
retrieval took place exactly along the beam line, then the rod was
invariably returned undamaged.

Eric realised that this breakthrough was exactly the sort of thing that
became the stuff of learned papers, PhDs and Professorships. He repeated
all his experiments again, this time filming each stage with a fixed
video camera.

<p class=drop>Chairman Rawale's days of meditation initially
coincided with a lull in activity at the extrusion site. Bracle began to
worry that pulling the red extrusion had, in some way, damaged the
production mechanism, whatever it was. Then came a cluster of small
extrusions, apparently composed of a variety of substances, but The
Committee forebade any tampering with them. Finally, coloured cylinders
began to appear, one by one. Some stayed, some became twisted, others
retracted. And still Bracle was forbidden to investigate more closely.

Such was Bracle's frustration that he continually provoked fights with
junior male colleagues, all of whom he easily defeated. In accordance
with ancient custom, he usually clipped off and ate an eyestalk from the
opponent. The department began to fill with limping scientists, many of
whom were regrowing eyestalks or nursing wounded tentacles. Between
these bouts, Bracle repeatedly forced himself on any subordinate female
too fearful  to resist his advances and angrily coupled with them, often
two or three at a time. 

It came as a relief to all concerned when Chairman Rawale re-convened
The Committee and summoned Bracle to hear their judgement. In short,
study of the phenomenon was to continue but there was to be no more
tugging or pushing. Further, Bracle was admonished for fighting with
colleagues, but was congratulated on his endeavour to multiply the race.
The priesthood frowned upon the recent popular enthusiasm for monogamy,
promoted by secular movements on the home planet.

But Bracle was determined to circumvent Rawale's rulings. It seemed to
him that great fame would accompany the person most closely associated
with the extrusion, and he was determined to be that person.
Within a short time of test resumption, Bracle was to be found crammed
into a tiny converted escape pod, which was tethered by a steel wire
rope to the latest extrusion, a red cylinder. In lip-service to The
Committee, he was neither pulling nor pushing the extrusion. He was
hoping to stay with it if it retracted and therefore to find out where
the extrusions were coming from. He was armed with a projectile weapon
and a laser side arm. He had never lacked courage, and had ignored the
cautiously expressed misgivings of the technicians who had helped him
organise the attempt. Bracle knew that, whether he returned or not, his
name would be honoured in perpetuity.

In the event, he was forced to repeat his experiment three more times
before the watching technicians saw his craft jerk and disappear as the
cylinder to which it was attached smoothly slid into nothingness. As
time went on, and he didn't return, some were enraged, others relieved.
Work continued, however, on study of the mysterious writings.

<p class=drop>Bruno was dismayed to spot what looked like a huge spider
or other bug lurking in a corner of the lab, nearly four centimetres in
diameter. Theoretically, this was impossible because of the
de-contamination entry process, but careless researchers like Eric were
capable of any outrage. Bruno bent to inspect the intruder, observing
that it appeared to have even more legs than was customary for a spider
- twelve or so - and that they were not jointed, but flexible. Judging
it to be too large safely to pick up, but wanting to show Eric the
evidence of a contaminated workplace, Bruno approached the creature with
a specimen jar and a handbrush, surprisingly receiving several painful
stings even before he touched it. He concluded that it must be spitting
venom at him. Irritated, he flicked it out of the corner with his brush
and stamped on it. A squashed exhibit would serve Bruno's purpose just
as well as a live one. Later, he found a strange silver sphere attached
by a wire to one of the plastic rods Eric had borrowed. Bruno had been
saving these rods for an atomic model, but Eric's new enthusiasm for
irradiated plastic was much preferred to the leakages of previous weeks.
With a grimace, he tore the sphere off and tossed it in the bin. The
sooner he was rid of Eric, he muttered to himself, the better.

[*BLURB] I had no intention of publishing a one-act play when I started this magazine,
but The Enormous Gun is sf, and amusing, so why not?

[*DESCRIPTION]  <P><I>Scene: A huge room painted in battleship grey, very
naval in appearance. The breech of a very large gun projects into the
room. A control desk is centre left. There are various warning signs,
covering matters as diverse as cautions against firing the gun by
mistake, and penalties for using the toilet during action stations.</I>
<p> <I>Enter Commander Elaine Fisher. She is an impressive early
middle-aged woman, dressed in a Naval uniform with medal ribbons, a
peaked cap and lots of gold braid. She steps up to the control console
and presses her forefinger to the screen.</I><p> 

Computer <i>(a mellifluous female voice, that speaks in a totally
unruffled and deliberate manner throughout)</i>: Arsole.

<br>
Elaine: What? Did you say 'arsehole'?

<br>
Computer: Groblag funt. Arsole.

<br>
Elaine: Oh, dear. Wrong language... Um... Menu!

<br>
Computer: Groblag funt.

<br>
Elaine: Same to you. 

<br>
Computer: Groblag funt.

<br> Elaine: <I>(pressing a button on the console (every time she speaks
to the Lieutenant, she presses the button))</I> Lieutenant White, are you
there?

<br>
Lieutenant George White (a tinny voice over an intercom): Yes, Commander.

<br>
Computer: Groblag funt.

<br>
Lt. White: What did you say, Commander?

<br> Elaine: That was the gun control, Lieutenant. It keeps talking in a
foreign language and I can't get the menu up to change it to standard
Anglic.

<br>
Lt. White: What is it saying?

<br>
Elaine: Sounds like 'groblag funt'.

<br>
Computer: Arsole.

<br>
Elaine: And 'arsehole'.

<br> Lt. White: Oh, yes. The Centaurians were on shift just before you.
Our chaps have been having a good laugh at that. 'Arsole' is Centauri for
'Ready', and that 'funt' thing means 'Please repeat'. 

<br> Elaine: Very funny, I'm sure, Lieutenant, but I am currently
responsible for one of the largest artillery pieces in the galaxy, and I
cannot control it in Centauri. How do I get the menu up and set it for
Anglic?

<br>
Computer: Arsole.

<br> Lt. White: Sorry, Commander. Just a minute... Sergeant Black thinks
he knows the Centauri for 'Menu'.

<br>
Elaine: Good.

<br>
Computer: Arsole.

<br>
Elaine: Shut up.

<br>
Computer: Groblag funt.

<br> Elaine: Hurry up, Lieutenant. This artillery battery is key to our
defence against the aliens. We are stuck out here on this disgusting
asteroid to defend the inner planets of the Solar System against
invasion, and the controller doesn't even understand Anglic.

<br> Lt. White: The thing is, this is a new version of the control
software. Previously, it only worked in Anglic, but the ExtremelyTinySoft
Corporation sent an update with all the Centauri vocabulary in it. The
Centaurians were quite thrilled. So were the Altairians.

<br>
Elaine: Stop gabbling, Lieutenant, what's the Centauri for Menu?

<br> Lt. White: Got it, Commander. Jim says it sounds like 'Peepee
shitbag'. Try that.

<br>
Elaine: (quietly) 'Peepee shitbag'? Are these Centaurians winding us up?

<br>
Lt. White: Very possibly. They have a strange sense of humour.

<br> 
Lt. White: No, sorry, Commander, Jim isn't exactly fluent in
Centauri. His vocabulary is limited to ordering food, drink and uh... certain
other services. And a few endearments, apparently.

<br>
Elaine: Well, isn't there a Centaurian there?

<br> Lt. White: No, Commander. The Centaurian tour of duty ended an hour
ago, and they have all left the fort in an ion frigate. We are trying to
contact them, but radio communications are flaky during the ion drive
phase of acceleration, so it may be an hour or two.

<br> Elaine: This is intolerable. There's an alert here and even that's
in Centauri. Can I reboot this thing and start again?

If you study the frame
of the screen, you'll see a tiny hole at the bottom right. Just poke
something in there and hold it for a second or two. Then you'll hear a
bleep. That puts it in language detect mode. Just say something in
Anglic and it'll start up, in Anglic this time.

<br> 
Elaine: <I>(peers at the screen, then pats her pockets, and looks
around the room desperately. Takes out a pen and pokes at the framework,
mutters.)</I> Lieutenant! I haven't got anything small enough to go in
the hole. Can you send someone down with a paper clip.

<br> Lt. White: Ahhh... no can do, I'm afraid. During an alert, the door to the control
chamber is time-locked to prevent desertion, remember. It opens if you
happen to die, of course, but I don't suppose...

<br> Elaine: Not yet. Oh, wait. There's a pin on my medal ribbons.

[*ITEM]	The Curse of Yig 

[*AUTHOR] H.P.Lovecraft and Zealia Bishop

[*BLURB] Story by Zealia Bishop, ghostwritten by Lovecraft. Originally published in the late 1920s
in Weird Tales.


[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>In 1925 I went into Oklahoma looking for snake lore, and I came out 
with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life. I admit it is foolish, 
since there are natural explanations for everything I saw and heard, 
but it masters me none the less. If the old story had been all there was to 
it, I would not have been so badly shaken. My work as an American Indian 
ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of extravagant legendry, 
and I know that simple white people can beat the redskins at their own 
game when it comes to fanciful inventions. But I can't forget what I saw 
with my own eyes at the insane asylum in Guthrie. 

I called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me I 
would find something important there. Neither Indians nor white men 
would discuss the snake-god legends I had come to trace. The oil-boom 
newcomers, of course, knew nothing of such matters, and the red men 
and old pioneers were plainly frightened when I spoke of them. Not 
more than six or seven people mentioned the asylum, and those who did 
were careful to talk in whispers. But the whisperers said that Dr. McNeill 
could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all I wanted to know. He 
could explain why Yig, the half-human father of serpents, is a shunned 
and feared object in central Oklahoma, and why old settlers shiver at the 
secret Indian orgies which make the autumn days and nights hideous 
with the ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely places. 

It was with the scent of a hound on the trail that I went to Guthrie, for 
I had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of serpent-worship 
among the Indians. I had always felt, from well-defined undertones 
of legend and archaeology, that great Quetzalcoatl - benign snake-god of 
the Mexicans - had had an older and darker prototype; and during recent 
months I had well-nigh proved it in a series of researches stretching 
from Guatemala to the Oklahoma plains. But everything was tantalising 
and incomplete, for above the border the cult of the snake was hedged 
about by fear and furtiveness. 

<div class=pullquote>I had to look into the malodorous den for several 
seconds before I could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the straw-covered floor</div>
Now it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to 
dawn, and I sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness I did not 
try to cloak. Dr. McNeill was a small, clean-shaven man of somewhat advanced 
years, and I saw at once from his speech and manner that he was 
a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his profession. 
Grave and doubtful when I first made known my errand, his face 
grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the letter of 
introduction which a kindly old ex-Indian agent had given me. 

"So you've been studying the Yig legend, eh?" he reflected sententiously. 
"I know that many of our Oklahoma ethnologists have tried to 
connect it with Quetzalcoatl, but I don't think any of them have traced 
the intermediate steps so well. You've done remarkable work for a man 
as young as you seem to be, and you certainly deserve all the data we 
can give. 

"I don't suppose old Major Moore or any of the others told you what it 
is I have here. They don't like to talk about it, and neither do I. It is very 
tragic and very horrible, but that is all. I refuse to consider it anything supernatural. 
There's a story about it that I'll tell you after you see it - a 
devilish sad story, but one that I won't call magic. It merely shews the 
potency that belief has over some people. I'll admit there are times when 
I feel a shiver that's more than physical, but in daylight I set all that 
down to nerves. I'm not a young fellow any more, alas! 

"To come to the point, the thing I have is what you might call a victim 
of Yig's curse - a physically living victim. We don't let the bulk of the 
nurses see it, although most of them know it's here. There are just two 
steady old chaps whom I let feed it and clean out its quarters - used to 
be three, but good old Stevens passed on a few years ago. I suppose I'll 
have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the thing doesn't seem to 
age or change much, and we old boys can't last forever. Maybe the ethics 
of the near future will let us give it a merciful release, but it's hard to tell. 

"Did you see that single ground-glass basement window over in the 
east wing when you came up the drive? That's where it is. I'll take you 
there myself now. You needn't make any comment. Just look through the 
moveable panel in the door and thank God the light isn't any stronger. 
Then I'll tell you the story - or as much as I've been able to piece 
together." 

We walked downstairs very quietly, and did not talk as we threaded 
the corridors of the seemingly deserted basement. Dr. McNeill unlocked 
a grey-painted steel door, but it was only a bulkhead leading to a further 
stretch of hallway. At length he paused before a door marked B 116, 
opened a small observation panel which he could use only by standing 
on tiptoe, and pounded several times upon the painted metal, as if to 
arouse the occupant, whatever it might be. 

A faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it, and I 
fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low, hissing response. Finally he 
motioned me to replace him at the peep-hole, and I did so with a causeless 
and increasing tremor. The barred, ground-glass window, close to 
the earth outside, admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor; and I had 
to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before I could see 
what was crawling and wriggling about on the straw-covered floor, 
emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss. Then the shadowed 
outlines began to take shape, and I perceived that the squirming 
entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat on its 
belly. I clutched at the door-handle for support as I tried to keep from 
fainting. 

The moving object was almost of human size, and entirely devoid of 
clothing. It was absolutely hairless, and its tawny-looking back seemed 
subtly squamous in the dim, ghoulish light. Around the shoulders it was 
rather speckled and brownish, and the head was very curiously flat. As it 
looked up to hiss at me I saw that the beady little black eyes were damnably 
anthropoid, but I could not bear to study them long. They fastened 
themselves on me with a horrible persistence, so that I closed the panel 
gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in its matted 
straw and spectral twilight. I must have reeled a bit, for I saw that the 
doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away. I was stuttering 
over and over again: "B-but for God's sake, what is it?" 

<p class=drop>Dr. McNeill told me the story in his private office as I sprawled opposite 
him in an easy-chair. The gold and crimson of late afternoon changed 
to the violet of early dusk, but still I sat awed and motionless. I resented 
every ring of the telephone and every whir of the buzzer, and I could 
have cursed the nurses and internes whose knocks now and then 
summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office. Night came, and I was 
glad my host switched on all the lights. Scientist though I was, my zeal 
for research was half forgotten amidst such breathless ecstasies of fright 
as a small boy might feel when whispered witch-tales go the rounds of 
the chimney-corner. 

It seems that Yig, the snake-god of the central plains 
tribes - presumably the primal source of the more southerly Quetzalcoatl 
or Kukulcan - was an odd, half-anthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary 
and capricious nature. He was not wholly evil, and was usually 
quite well-disposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and 
his children, the serpents; but in the autumn he became abnormally 
ravenous, and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites. That 
was why the tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo country 
pounded ceaselessly week in and week out in August, September, and 
October; and why the medicine-men made strange noises with rattles 
and whistles curiously like those of the Aztecs and Mayas. 

Yig's chief trait was a relentless devotion to his children - a devotion 
so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the 
venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region. Frightful clandestine 
tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked 
harm upon his wriggling progeny; his chosen method being to turn his 
victim, after suitable tortures, to a spotted snake. 

In the old days of the Indian Territory, the doctor went on, there was 
not quite so much secrecy about Yig. The plains tribes, less cautious than 
the desert nomads and Pueblos, talked quite freely of their legends and 
autumn ceremonies with the first Indian agents, and let considerable of 
the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of white settlement. 
The great fear came in the land-rush days of '89, when some extraordinary 
incidents had been rumoured, and the rumours sustained, 
by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs. Indians said that the 
new white men did not know how to get on with Yig, and afterward the 
settlers came to take that theory at face value. Now no old-timer in 
middle Oklahoma, white or red, could be induced to breathe a word 
about the snake-god except in vague hints. Yet after all, the doctor added 
with almost needless emphasis, the only truly authenticated horror had 
been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of bewitchment. It was all very 
material and cruel - even that last phase which ha caused so much 
dispute. 

Dr. McNeill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his 
special story, and I felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre curtain 
rises. The thing had begun when Walker Davis and his wife Audrey left 
Arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the spring of 1889, 
and the end had come in the country of the Wichitas - north of the 
Wichita River, in what is at present Caddo County. There is a small village 
called Binger there now, and the railway goes through; but otherwise 
the place is less changed than other parts of Oklahoma. It is still a 
section of farms and ranches - quite productive in these days - since the 
great oil-fields do not come very close. 

Walker and Audrey had come from Franklin County in the Ozarks 
with a canvas-topped wagon, two mules, an ancient and useless dog 
called "Wolf", and all their household goods. They were typical hill-folk, 
youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most, and looked forward 
to a life of better returns for their a hard work than they had had in 
Arkansas. Both were lean, raw-boned specimens; the man tall, sandy, 
and grey-eyed, and the woman short and rather dark, with a black 
straightness of hair suggesting a slight Indian admixture. 

In general, there was very little of distinction about them, and but for 
one thing their annals might not have differed from those of thousands 
of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that time. That 
thing was Walker's almost epileptic fear of snakes, which some laid to 
prenatal causes, and some said came from a dark prophecy about his end 
with which an old Indian squaw had tried to scare him when he was 
small. Whatever the cause, the effect was marked indeed; for despite his 
strong general courage the very mention of a snake would cause him to 
grow faint and pale, while the sight of even a tiny specimen would produce 
a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion seizure. 

The Davises started out early in the year, in the hope of being on their 
new land for the spring ploughing. Travel was slow; for the roads were 
bad in Arkansas, while in the Territory there were great stretches of 
rolling hills and red, sandy barrens without any roads whatever. As the 
terrain grew flatter, the change from their native mountains depressed 
them more, perhaps, than they realised; but they found the people at the 
Indian agencies very affable, while most of the settled Indians seemed 
friendly and civil. Now and then they encountered a fellow-pioneer, 
with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable rivalry were 
generally exchanged. 

Owing to the season, there were not many snakes in evidence, so 
Walker did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness. In the 
earlier stages of the journey, too, there were no Indian snake-legends to 
trouble him; for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not share 
the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours. As fate would have it, it 
was a white man at Okmulgee in the Creek country who gave the Davises 
the first hint of Yig beliefs; a hint which had a curiously fascinating 
effect on Walker, and caused him to ask questions very freely after that. 

Before long Walker's fascination had developed into a bad case of 
fright. He took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the nightly 
camps, always clearing away whatever vegetation he found, and avoiding 
stony places whenever he could. Every clump of stunted bushes and 
every cleft in the great, slab-like rocks seemed to him now to hide 
malevolent serpents, while every human figure not obviously part of a 
settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snake-god till 
nearness had proved the contrary. Fortunately no troublesome encounters 
came at this stage to shake his nerves still further. 

As they approached the Kickapoo country they found it harder and 
harder to avoid camping near rocks. Finally it was no longer possible, 
and poor Walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some 
of the rustic anti-snake charms he had learned in his boyhood. Two or 
three times a snake was really glimpsed, and these sights did not help 
the sufferer in his efforts to preserve composure. 

On the twenty-second evening of the journey a savage wind made it 
imperative, for the sake of the mules, to camp in as sheltered a spot as 
possible; and Audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a cliff 
which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former tributary 
of the Canadian River. He did not like the rocky cast of the place, but allowed 
himself to be overruled this once; leading the animals sullenly toward 
the protecting slope, which the nature of the ground would not allow 
the wagon to approach. 

Audrey, examining the rocks near the wagon, meanwhile noticed a 
singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog. Seizing a rifle, she followed 
his lead, and presently thanked her stars that she had forestalled 
Walker in her discovery. For there, snugly nested in the gap between two 
boulders, was a sight it would have done him no good to see. Visible 
only as one convoluted expanse, but perhaps comprising as many as 
three or four separate units, was a mass of lazy wriggling which could 
not be other than a brood of new-born rattlesnakes. 

Anxious to save Walker from a trying shock, Audrey did not hesitate 
to act, but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down 
again and again upon the writhing objects. Her own sense of loathing 
was great, but it did not amount to a real fear. Finally she saw that her 
task was done, and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the red 
sand and dry, dead grass near by. She must, she reflected, cover the nest 
up before Walker got back from tethering the mules. Old Wolf, tottering 
relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was, had vanished, 
and she feared he had gone to fetch his master. 

Footsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded. A second more, 
and Walker had seen everything. Audrey made a move to catch him if he 
should faint, but he did no more than sway. Then the look of pure fright 
on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled awe and 
anger, and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tones. 

"Gawd's sake, Aud, but why'd ye go for to do that? Hain't ye heerd all 
the things they've been tellin' about this snake-devil Yig? Ye'd ought to a 
told me, and we'd a moved on. Don't ye know they's a devil-god what 
gets even if ye hurts his children? What for d'ye think the Injuns all 
dances and beats their drums in the fall about? This land's under a curse, 

I tell ye - nigh every soul we've a-talked to sence we come in's said the 
same. Yig rules here, an' he comes out every fall for to git his victims and 
turn 'em into snakes. Why, Aud, they won't none of them Injuns acrost 
the Canayjin kill a snake for love nor money! 

"Gawd knows what ye done to yourself, gal, a-stompin' out a hull 
brood o' Yig's chillen. He'll git ye, sure, sooner or later, unlessen I kin 
buy a charm offen some o' the Injun medicine-men. He'll git ye, Aud, as 
sure's they's a Gawd in heaven - he'll come outa the night and turn ye into 
a crawlin' spotted snake!" 

All the rest of the journey Walker kept up the frightened reproofs and 
prophecies. They crossed the Canadian near Newcastle, and soon afterward 
met with the first of the real plains Indians they had seen - a party 
of blanketed Wichitas, whose leader talked freely under the spell of the 
whiskey offered him, and taught poor Walker a long-winded protective 
charm against Yig in exchange for a quart bottle of the same inspiring 
fluid. By the end of the week the chosen site in the Wichita country was 
reached, and the Davises made haste to trace their boundaries and perform 
the spring ploughing before even beginning the construction of a 
cabin. 

The region was flat, drearily windy, and sparse of natural vegetation, 
but promised great fertility under cultivation. Occasional outcroppings 
of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone, and here and 
there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground like 
a man-made floor. There seemed to be a very few snakes, or possible 
dens for them; so Audrey at last persuaded Walker to build the one-
room cabin over a vast, smooth slab of exposed stone. With such a flooring 
and with a good-sized fireplace the wettest weather might be defied - 
though it soon became evident that dampness was no salient quality 
of the district. Logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest belt of 
woods, many miles toward the Wichita Mountains. 

Walker built his wide-chimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of 
some of the other settlers, though the nearest one was over a mile away. 
In turn, he helped his helpers at similar house-raisings, so that many ties 
of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours. There was no 
town worthy the name nearer than El Reno, on the railway thirty miles 
or more to the northeast; and before many weeks had passed, the people 
of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of their 
scattering. The Indians, a few of whom had begun to settle down on 
ranches, were for the most part harmless, though somewhat quarrelsome 
when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to them despite 
all government bans. 

Of all the neighbours the Davises found Joe and Sally Compton, who 
likewise hailed from Arkansas, the most helpful and congenial. Sally is 
still alive, known now as Grandma Compton; and her son Clyde, then an 
infant in arms, has become one of the leading men of the state. Sally and 
Audrey used to visit each other often, for their cabins were only two 
miles apart; and in the long spring and summer afternoons they exchanged 
many a tale of old Arkansas and many a rumour about the new 
country. 

Sally was very sympathetic about Walker's weakness regarding 
snakes, but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel 
nervousness which Audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying 
and prophesying about the curse of Yig. She was uncommonly full of 
gruesome snake stories, and produced a direfully strong impression 
with her acknowledged masterpiece - the tale of a man in Scott County 
who had been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once, and had 
swelled so monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with 
a pop. Needless to say, Audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband, 
and she implored the Comptons to beware of starting it on the 
rounds of the countryside. It is to Joe's and Sally's credit that they heeded 
this plea with the utmost fidelity. 

Walker did his corn-planting early, and in midsummer improved his 
time by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region. With the 
help of Joe Compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of 
very good water, though he planned to sink an artesian later on. He did 
not run into many serious snake scares, and made his land as inhospitable 
as possible for wriggling visitors. Every now and then he rode over 
to the cluster of thatched, conical huts which formed the main village of 
the Wichitas, and talked long with the old men and shamans about the 
snake-god and how to nullify his wrath. Charms were always ready in 
exchange for whiskey, but much of the information he got was far from 
reassuring. 

Yig was a great god. He was bad medicine. He did not forget things. In 
the autumn his children were hungry and wild, and Yig was hungry and 
wild, too. All the tribes made medicine against Yig when the corn harvest 
came. They gave him some corn, and danced in proper regalia to the 
sound of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept the drums pounding to 
drive Yig away, and called down the aid of Tir?, whose children men are, 
even as the snakes are Yig's children. It was bad that the squaw of Davis 
killed the children of Yig. Let Davis say the charms many times when the 
corn harvest comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god. 

By the time the corn harvest did come, Walker had succeeded in getting 
his wife into a deplorably jumpy state. His prayers and borrowed incantations 
came to be a nuisance; and when the autumn rites of the Indians 
began, there was always a distant wind-borne pounding of tom-toms 
to lend an added background of the sinister. It was maddening to have 
the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains. Why would 
it never stop? Day and night, week on week, it was always going in exhaustless 
relays, as persistently as the red dusty winds that carried it. 
Audrey loathed it more than her husband did, for he saw in it a compensating 
element of protection. It was with this sense of a mighty, intangible 
bulwark against evil that he got in his corn crop and prepared 
cabin and stable for the coming winter. 

The autumn was abnormally warm, and except for their primitive 
cookery the Davises found scant use for the stone fireplace Walker had 
built with such care. Something in the unnaturalness of the hot dust-
clouds preyed on the nerves of all the settlers, but most of all on 
Audrey's and Walker's. The notions of a hovering snake-curse and the 
weird, endless rhythm of the distant Indian drums formed a bad combination 
which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly 
unendurable. 

Notwithstanding this strain, several festive gatherings were held at 
one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped; keeping naively 
alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvest-home which are as 
old as human agriculture itself. Lafayette Smith, who came from southern 
Missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of Walker's, was a 
very passable fiddler; and his tunes did much to make the celebrants forget 
the monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms. Then Hallowe'en 
drew near, and the settlers planned another frolic - this time, had they 
but known it, of a lineage older than even agriculture; the dread Witch-
Sabbath of the primal pre-Aryans, kept alive through ages in the midnight 
blackness of secret woods, and still hinting at vague terrors under 
its latter-day mask of comedy and lightness. Hallowe'en was to fall on a 
Thursday, and the neighbours agreed to gather for their first revel at the 
Davis cabin. 

It was on that thirty-first of October that the warm spell broke. The 
morning was grey and leaden, and by noon the incessant winds had 
changed from searingness to rawness. People shivered all the more because 
they were not prepared for the chill, and Walker Davis' old dog 
Wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth. But 
the distant drums still thumped on, nor were the white citizenry less inclined 
to pursue their chosen rites. As early as four in the afternoon the 
wagons began to arrive at Walker's cabin; and in the evening, after a 
memorable barbecue, Lafayette Smith's fiddle inspired a very fair-sized 
company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in the one good-sized 
but crowded room. The younger folk indulged in the amiable inanities 
proper to the season, and now and then old Wolf would howl with doleful 
and spine-tickling ominousness at some especially spectral strain 
from Lafayette's squeaky violin - a device he had never heard before. 
Mostly, though, this battered veteran slept through the merriment; for he 
was past the age of active interests and lived largely in his dreams. Tom 
and Jennie Rigby had brought their collie Zeke along, but the canines did 
not fraternise. Zeke seemed strangely uneasy over something, and nosed 
around curiously all the evening. 

Audrey and Walker made a fine couple on the floor, and Grandma 
Compton still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night. 
Their worries seemed forgotten for the nonce, and Walker was shaved 
and trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness. By ten o'clock all 
hands were healthily tired, and the guests began to depart family by 
family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time 
everybody had had. Tom ands Jennie thought Zeke's eerie howls as he 
followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go 
home; though Audrey said it must be the far-away tom-toms which annoyed 
him, for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the 
merriment within. 

The night was bitterly cold, and for the first time Walker put a great 
log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering till 
morning. Old Wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed 
into his customary coma. Audrey and Walker, too tired to think of 
charms or curses, tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep before 
the cheap alarm-clock on the mantel had ticked out three minutes. 
And from far away, the rhythmic pounding of those hellish tom-toms 
still pulsed on the chill night-wind. 

Dr. McNeill paused here and removed his glasses, as if a blurring of 
the objective world might make the reminiscent vision clearer. 
"You'll soon appreciate," he said, "that I had a great deal of difficulty in 
piecing out all that happened after the guests left. There were times, 
though - at first - when I was able to make a try at it." After a moment of 
silence he went on with the tale. 

Audrey had terrible dreams of Yig, who appeared to her in the guise 
of Satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen. It was, indeed, 
from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake 
to find Walker already conscious and sitting up in bed. He seemed to be 
listening intently to something, and silenced her with a whisper when 
she began to ask what had roused him. 

"Hark, Aud!" he breathed. "Don't ye hear somethin' a-singin' and 
buzzin' and rustlin'? D'ye reckon it's the fall crickets?" 

Certainly, there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound 
as he had described. Audrey tried to analyse it, and was impressed with 
some element at once horrible and familiar, which hovered just outside 
the rim of her memory. And beyond it all, waking a hideous thought, the 
monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms came incessantly across the 
black plains on which a cloudy half-moon had set. 

"Walker - s'pose it's - the - the - curse o' Yig?" 

She could feel him tremble. 

"No, gal, I don't reckon he comes that away. He's shapen like a man, 
except ye look at him clost. That's what Chief Grey Eagle says. This 
here's some varmints come in outen the cold - not crickets, I calc'late, but 
summat like 'em. I'd orter git up and stomp 'em out afore they make 
much headway or git at the cupboard." 

He rose, felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach, and rattled 
the tin match-box nailed to the wall beside it. Audrey sat up in bed and 
watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the lantern. 
Then, as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room, the crude 
rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek. For the flat, 
rocky floor, revealed in the new-born illumination, was one seething, 
brown-speckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes, slithering toward the 
fire, and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace the fright-
blasted lantern-bearer. 

It was only for an instant that Audrey saw the things. The reptiles 
were of every size, of uncountable numbers, and apparently of several 
varieties; and even as she looked, two or three of them reared their heads 
as if to strike at Walker. She did not faint - it was Walker's crash to the 
floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into blackness. He 
had not screamed a second time - fright had paralysed him, and he fell 
as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortal's bow. To Audrey the entire 
world seemed to whirl about fantastically, mingling with the nightmare 
from which she had started. 

Voluntary motion of any sort was impossible, for will and the sense of 
reality had left her. She fell back inertly on her pillow, hoping that she 
would wake soon. No actual sense of what had happened penetrated her 
mind for some time. Then, little by little, the suspicion that she was 
really awake began to dawn on her; and she was convulsed with a 
mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out 
despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mute. 

Walker was gone, and she had not been able to help him. He had died 
of snakes, just as the old witch-woman had predicted when he was a 
little boy. Poor Wolf had not been able to help, either - probably he had 
not even awaked from his senile stupor. And now the crawling things 
must be coming for her, writhing closer and closer every moment in the 
dark, perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing 
up over the coarse woollen blankets. Unconsciously she crept under 
the clothes and trembled. 

It must be the curse of Yig. He had sent his monstrous children on All-
Hallows' Night, and they had taken Walker first. Why was that - wasn't 
he innocent enough? Why not come straight for her - hadn't she killed 
those little rattlers alone? Then she thought of the curse's form as told by 
the Indians. She wouldn't be killed - just turned to a spotted snake. Ugh! 
So she would be like those things she had glimpsed on the floor - those 
things which Yig had sent to get her and enroll her among their number! 
She tried to mumble a charm that Walker had taught her, but found she 
could not utter a single sound. 

The noisy ticking of the alarm-clock sounded above the maddening 
beat of the distant tom-toms. The snakes were taking a long time - did 
they mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves? Every now and 
then she thought she felt a steady, insidious pressure on the bedclothes, 
but each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her 
overwrought nerves. The clock ticked on in the dark, and a change came 
slowly over her thoughts. 

Those snakes couldn't have taken so long! They couldn't be Yig's messengers 
after all, but just natural rattlers that were nested below the rock 
and had been drawn there by the fire. They weren't coming for her, 
perhaps - perhaps they had sated themselves on poor Walker. Where 
were they now? Gone? Coiled by the fire? Still crawling over the prone 
corpse of their victim? The clock ticked, and the distant drums throbbed 
on. 

At the thought of her husband's body lying there in the pitch blackness 
a thrill of purely physical horror passed over Audrey. That story of Sally 
Compton's about the man back in Scott County! He, too, had been bitten 
by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes, and what had happened to him? The 
poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse, and in the end 
the bloated thing had burst horribly - burst horribly with a detestable 
popping noise. Was that what was happening to Walker down there on 
the rock floor? Instinctively she felt she had begun to listen for 
something too terrible even to name to herself. 

The clock ticked on, keeping a kind of mocking, sardonic time with the 
far-off drumming that the night-wind brought. She wished it were a 
striking clock, so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil must 
last. She cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her from fainting, and 
wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring, after all. Probably 
neighbours would pass - no doubt somebody would call - would they 
find her still sane? Was she still sane now? 

Morbidly listening, Audrey all at once became aware of something 
which she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could believe 
it; and which, once verified, she did not know whether to welcome 
or dread. The distant beating of the Indian tom-toms had ceased. They 
had always maddened her - but had not Walker regarded them as a bulwark 
against nameless evil from outside the universe? What were some 
of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking with 
Grey Eagle and the Wichita medicine-men? 

She did not relish this new and sudden silence, after all! There was 
something sinister about it. The loud-ticking clock seemed abnormal in 
its new loneliness. Capable at last of conscious motion, she shook the 
covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window. It 
must have cleared after the moon set, for she saw the square aperture 
distinctly against the background of stars. 

Then without warning came that shocking, unutterable 
sound - ugh! - that dull, putrid pop of cleft skin and escaping poison in 
the dark. God! - Sally's story - that obscene stench, and this gnawing, 
clawing silence! It was too much. The bonds of muteness snapped, and 
the black night waxed reverberant with Audrey's screams of stark, unbridled 
frenzy. 

Consciousness did not pass away with the shock. How merciful if only 
it had! Amidst the echoes of her shrieking Audrey still saw the star-
sprinkled square of window ahead, and heard the doom-boding ticking 
of that frightful clock. Did she hear another sound? Was that square window 
still a perfect square? She was in no condition to weigh the evidence 
of her senses or distinguish between fact and hallucination. 

No - that window was not a perfect square. Something had encroached 
on the lower edge. Nor was the ticking of the clock the only 
sound in the room. There was, beyond dispute, a heavy breathing 
neither her own nor poor Wolf's. Wolf slept very silently, and his wakeful 
wheezing was unmistakable. Then Audrey saw against the stars the 
black, daemoniac silhouette of something anthropoid - the undulant 
bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders fumbling slowly toward her. 

"Y'aaaah! Y'aaaah! Go away! Go away! Go away, snake-devil! Go 'way, 
Yig! I didn't mean to kill 'em - I was feared he'd be scairt of 'em. Don't, 
Yig, don't! I didn't go for to hurt yore chillen - don't come nigh 
me - don't change me into no spotted snake!" 

But the half-formless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward 
the bed, very silently. 

Everything snapped at once inside Audrey's head, and in a second she 
had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman. She knew 
where the axe was - hung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern. 
It was within easy reach, and she could find it in the dark. Before 
she was conscious of anything further it was in her hands, and she was 
creeping toward the foot of the bed - toward the monstrous head and 
shoulders that every moment groped their way nearer. Had there been 
any light, the look on her face would not have been pleasant to see. 

"Take that, you! And that, and that, and that!" 

She was laughing shrilly now, and her cackles mounted higher as she 
saw that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim 
prophetic pallor of coming dawn. 

<p class=drop>Dr. McNeill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his 
glasses again. I waited for him to resume, and as he kept silent I spoke softly. 

"She lived? She was found? Was it ever explained?" 

The doctor cleared his throat. 

"Yes - she lived, in a way. And it was explained. I told you there was 
no bewitchment - only cruel, pitiful, material horror." 

It was Sally Compton who had made the discovery. She had ridden 
over to the Davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with 
Audrey, and had seen no smoke from the chimney. That was queer. It 
had turned very warm again, yet Audrey was usually cooking 
something at that hour. The mules were making hungry-sounding noises 
in the barn, and there was no sign of old Wolf sunning himself in the accustomed 
spot by the door. 

Altogether, Sally did not like the look of the place, so was very timid 
and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked. She got no answer but 
waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs. The lock, it 
appeared, was unfastened; and she slowly pushed her way in. Then, perceiving 
what was there, she reeled back, gasped, and clung to the jamb to 
preserve her balance. 

A terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door, but that was 
not what had stunned her. It was what she had seen. For within that 
shadowy cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects 
remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholder. 

Near the burned-out fireplace was the great dog - purple decay on the 
skin left bare by mange and old age, and the whole carcass burst by the 
puffing effect of rattlesnake poison. It must have been bitten by a veritable 
legion of the reptiles. 

To the right of the door was the axe-hacked remnant of what had been 
a man - clad in a nightshirt, and with the shattered bulk of a lantern 
clenched in one hand. He was totally free from any sign of snake-bite. 
Near him lay the ensanguined axe, carelessly discarded. 

And wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome, vacant-eyed thing 
that had been a woman, but was now only a mute mad caricature. All 
that this thing could do was to hiss, and hiss, and hiss. 

Both the doctor and I were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by 
this time. He poured something from a flask on his desk, took a nip, and 
handed another glass to me. I could only suggest tremulously and 
stupidly: 

"So Walker had only fainted that first time - the screams roused him, 
and the axe did the rest?" 

"Yes." Dr. McNeill's voice was low. "But he met his death from snakes 
just the same. It was his fear working in two ways - it made him faint, 
and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to 
strike out when she thought she saw the snake-devil." 

I thought for a moment. 

"And Audrey - wasn't it queer how the curse of Yig seemed to work itself 
out on her? I suppose the impression of hissing snakes had been 
fairly ground into her." 

"Yes. There were lucid spells at first, but they got to be fewer and fewer. 
Her hair came white at the roots as it grew, and later began to fall out. 
The skin grew blotchy, and when she died - " 

I interrupted with a start. 

"Died? Then what was that - that thing downstairs?" 

McNeill spoke gravely. 

"That is what was born to her three-quarters of a year afterward. There 
were three more of them - two were even worse - but this is the only one 
that lived."
