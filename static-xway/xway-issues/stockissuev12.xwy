many are. However, in this edition, at least three of the contributors are over 70 years old,
demonstrating that the desire to write is a lifelong compulsion.

[*ITEM] Starbat

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] In an era of global threats, no resource should be ignored.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">An overheard breakfast-time conversation
accidentally invested his daydreams with an interstellar entity he had
not previously encountered, when he became vaguely aware that he had
heard the same name mentioned several times: the <i>Starbat Martyr</i>.
At an age when he and his friends were more preoccupied with
acquiring the superpowers possessed by the heroes of film and comic
strip, his parents' love of classical music had not discernibly begun to
rub off. Not that he lacked serious concerns; fast-melting
glaciers, the sorry plight of bees, all those senseless wars&#8230;
His gloomy Scottish uncle had once told him "We're going to Hull
in a handbasket, laddie." It didn't make much sense in terms of
geography or transport, but he couldn't help agreeing with the
sentiment.</p> 
<p>Although he was content to allow most adult discourse to
drift over his head, sometimes the odd word or phrase would trigger his
attention. Once he heard them talking animatedly about <i>The
Emperor</i>, but lost interest when it turned out to have nothing to do
with either Star Wars or penguins. The Starbat Martyr swam into his
inner vision, a vast ancient creature, older than the galaxy, probably
the last of its kind, harnessing dark energy to glide effortlessly
between star systems, its true purpose long forgotten, but drawn to
seeking out and rescuing civilizations threatened by events beyond their
control.  Like&#8230;  Well, like rogue asteroids, and
massive solar flares.  There was always the chance of an escaped
nanovirus, of course.  And (he supposed) the usual cranky
billionaire megalomaniacs in their hidden fortresses plotting world
domination.  But nothing the old Starbat couldn't
handle.</p> 
<p>It would have to be telepathic, able
to contact a few receptive minds, maybe while they were asleep.  He
imagined being among those favoured few.  On waking, they would
share the relevant portion of the Starbat's immense store of knowledge
and perceptions concerning the danger to their planet.  Then they
would join forces and act swiftly in time to help save the world.
 Exactly how would depend on the kind of threat - details were
not important at this stage of his musing, but he reckoned that it would
be easy enough to alert NASA, the CIA, MI5, MIT, the Max Planck
Institute, or whoever else needed to be informed.  The Starbat's
contactees would encounter disbelief at first, but the sheer quantity
and clarity of their information would be bound to convince the
sceptics.   Then people would have to cooperate unselfishly
for the first time - governments, scientists, engineers&#8230;.
 Plans would need be formulated, and perhaps new technologies
developed.   Eventually the danger would be averted, and he
and his fellow 'receptives' would attend ceremonies where they would be
given special awards, and (he ignored for the moment the possiblility
that 'receptives' might be of mixed gender) they would more than likely
be pursued by hundreds of gorgeous girls&#8230;  His daydream
drifted into more familiar adolescent territory.</p> 
<p><i>At the periphery of its perceptual field, a faint
persistent clamour signified a sentient world.  It probed gently,
its elegant cortical network of quasi-organic crystalline lattices
coruscating with a flux of radiant energy, generating propulsive waves
along its outstretched membranes.  Duty called.  Light-years
away, the minds of a handful of dreaming humans echoed a weary sigh of
seemingly cosmic proportions.</i>

[*ITEM] The Temple of the Inevitable

[*AUTHOR] Peter Morrison

[*BLURB]  If you do not resist the apparently inevitable, you will never
know how inevitable the inevitable was.	<snall>Terry Eagleton</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The matronly  blonde woman on the information desk is
still on the phone and precious seconds of Laban Wilmer's holiday are
passing every minute. The shiny silver name badge reads "Colaiezzi
Ican", she notes, again. Huffs for a
moment, then puffs for a moment. But neither make a difference, the
phone conversation seems to be so engrossing that a mere
visitor to the museum couldn't take Mrs Ican away from the intrigue.</P>
<P>Laban has been planning this trip for months, carefully
researching Big City attractions. Everyone has been to Big City &ndash;
they all go see Bacon's Column, the Tower Bell and the Pyramid Eye.
Laban wanted her visit to be <I>different</I>; she has
spent time making lists and notes, notes and lists, of unusual things
to see in the city. Lunch time of her last day at work she had carefully
printed these out, careful in her conciseness, careful to use as
little work paper as possible. She had folded those few sheets,
carefully, and slid them into her bag, with a sense that now she was
prepared for her great adventure.</P>
<P>But things aren't going entirely well. Laban is
disappointed by the progress here at the first stop on her check list
&ndash; Dey Esoterich Musuum O Anthroapology. Here, there 
is reputed to be many
an unusual and esoteric exhibit, but the prize among prizes and the
top draw for her is The Temple of The Inevitable. The ancient temple
was uncovered on the shores of the northernmost island of Smaisla
(she had read on the blog post), which had put this particular item at
the top of her must-see list.  An obscure and largely overlooked
temple from the Inevitable faith. Awesome!</P>
<P>Except she can't find it. Laban has read all the signs.
Laban has read the fold-out pages of the guide. Laban is desperately
waiting to ask a member of staff, keen not to be thwarted so easily
this early on in her trip. But Colaiezzi <i>Do
they call her Cola for short?</i> is not cooperating one bit. Laban
dabbles with the old huffing and puffing again, just for the sake of
form, because she is confident that she can huff and puff as much as she
wants, to no avail.</P>
<P>Footsteps. Laban whips round. There! A security guard
of some kind &ndash; stereotypical
in his black trousers, shiny shoes, white collar peeking out from
behind a jumper, blue, with
shoulder epaulettes, and the museum's logo at the breast. 
He is slightly podgy, balding, and looks
amiable enough, this Kung Britney, Laban thinks, automatically reading
his name badge and filing the details away, same as she always does.
She trots to catch up with him, establishing that 
balance between
looking dignified and not losing the man as he does another circuit.</P>
<P>"Excuse me?" Laban
calls, pitching her voice at casual and inquisitive. Kung turns to
her slowly, raising a quizzical eyebrow at her, like he has all the
time in the world, and with a job like this she suspects he might
well do. His face suggests he is wondering where
she came from. Here he is, having a casual stroll, only to be accosted
by strangers. Which causes Laban to reflect on the fact that she hasn't
seen any other visitors so far, in her initial, cursory, wanderings.</P>
<P>"Yes?" he nods, in a
manner which conveys that if you'll only just give him a minute he
will say more. "Can I help you?" This said with a tone that
expresses doubt about the chances of that being the case. He looks her
up and down, taking in her holiday attire &ndash;
her favourite Edie Eunji
art t-shirt, her worn-out comfy jeans, her black hair in a pony tail,
new trainers bought for holiday walking. He seems to be confused by
it all. </P>
<P>She wields the crumpled piece of paper in front of her, held clasped in
her hand anxiously this whole time – conscious of how confidently she had
circled that first item on the list in blue ink in preparation for her
adding a big tick once she has finally "Been there. Done that." She holds
the paper up, "I'm looking for an exhibit – can you help me? It is the
Temple of The Inevitable?"</P>
<P>"The what have you?" He glances at the paper, but only in the most perfunctory
fashion, before looking back at her, his expression slowly morphing
into that of confusion. Confusion turning into a frown, as if to say
that she isn't going to pull one over him as easily as that. After
all, does she know how many years he has worked here and never had
such a preposterous enquiry?</P>
<P>"The temple?" She
smiles and nods encouragingly, as if she
thinks it might help, though she is already deep into the conviction
that she is wasting her time, "Of
inevitability," she adds, with a glimmer
of false hope, "You know?"</P>
<P> "No," he shakes his
head to emphasize the word, "I don't know.
Of course, we have many temples in the Museum &ndash;
have you tried the Room of Stray Temple Pillars or the Array of
Reconstructed Probable Temple Structures?"
He asks this while pursing his lips thoughtfully,
before glancing at the clock above the information desk, clearly more
interested in wistfully counting the minutes to his next tea break. 
</P>
<P>"I looked. But none of those were inevitable,"
Laban sighs with weary insistence.</P>
<P>"Well perhaps that is because it doesn't exist?
Whoever heard of an inevitable religion?"
He reaches forward and takes her precious crumpled paper from her,
gives it a substantially perfunctory glance.
Taking in the web address for the blog which is included beside the
bullet-pointed destination, "Ah, you read
about it on the internet? Always a reliable source, pet. Sounds like
you've been had." 
</P>
<P>He turns from her, and walks away, giving her
the momentary impression that he is blatantly
dismissing her. But she realises that he is in
fact walking towards the display which contains the folded floor
plans of the museum. She trots discreetly to try
and catch up with him, as though she has understood his intent from
the start, regardless of his blatant bad manners. He flips out the
flaps of the folded floor maps, runs a
finger along the indexed list of exhibitions, then
glances at the ground floor, the first floor, the
second floor, and special exhibition space, before declaring with
some satisfaction "See! We do not have an
inevitable temple!"</P>
<P>
She sighs, disappointed. She has already looked at the
map and the indexed list, but is of
the opinion that it must surely be out of date. Given
the burgeoning enthusiasm and effort she put into researching
and scheduling this morning visit to the inevitable temple, 
Laban is disappointed. She searches Kung's face for some sense that at
least some part of him registers this fact. Perhaps his emotions are at
least a little conflicted? Despite the sense of glee at being proved right
he seems to be demonstrating.</P>
<P>"Have you tried the Mesopotatian Temple of Doom in the special
exhibit space? It really is rather good, if you like that kind of
thing," he offers in consolation with a shrug. Not wanting to
give her the wrong impression, after all. 
</P>
<P>"I"ll go take a look," Laban nods sadly at Kung. As
she enters the body of the museum once again, she pulls out her phone,
frustrated and determined. The temple must be here somewhere! An
international conspiracy to hide it from the prying eyes of the
public, she decides, it seems like the only rational explanation. She
pokes the screen, scrolling through to the internet, which is how she
finds herself back on the page for Friends of The Inevitable. But
this time her GPS flickers, her coordinates appear on the screen in a
way that they haven't any time she 
has previously accessed the site.
The text that shows her coordinates pulses for a moment, before
turning green. A new icon appears, with the hovering text that says:
The Inevitable App. Without hesitation she downloads and installs the
piece of software, curious as to what it is going to reveal. 
</P>
<P>Once installed, her screen lights up, the camera switches on, so that
she can see the room through the lens. She waves it over the map that
she is holding, mainly for the sake of it, not really expecting any
reaction. So it is with some surprise when she sees the flash of
another annexe to the building appear on the map. She looks at the
tangible paper map in her hand, it shows the same old map, she looks
through the phone and the additional structure persists. 
</P>
<P>Yes! I knew it. She cheers silently, understanding now that the game
is afoot, that shadowy forces stand between her and the inevitable.
Raising the device, Laban waves it around in front of her, watching
the screen attentively. She swings round, passing over the various
exits off The Hall of Weapons in Glass Cases, where she is currently
standing. She gets an arrow flash up over one of the entrances, so
she starts to walk in that direction, relishing her sense of victory.</P>
<P>Through the door, she finds herself in The Corridor of Ancient Marble
Statues Without Noses. <i>Every museum seems to have one of these</i>, she
reflects. She checks the app every couple of steps, till it directs
her down a flight of stairs and around a corner. Here are the
Patalonian Gateways, there the Sphinx of the Maztexan Emperors, and
according to the map she is close to finding the temple. Which is
when she spots Kung Britney once more &ndash; <i>How did he get down
here ahead of her? Why did he come this way? What is he trying to
hide?</i></P>
<P>She concludes he must know about the temple, must be a member of the
ancient order who persist in trying to hide it from the world!
Dastardly rascals! She smirks, amused by the silliness of the whole
idea. Now she is starting to enjoy her holiday. She hides, pressing
herself against a case of Bulgoslav Stone Age Pop Art, trying to
regulate her breathing to make as little noise as possible. 
</P>
<P>Kung seems to be wandering aimlessly, strolling round the exhibits in
the most unremarkable manner of any person she has ever seen. She
follows him as he ambles towards where she thinks the temple should
be, cautious, hanging back. She slides from the case of Cubetic
Grooming Combs, to the display of Iroqccan Nightmare Masks. Ensuring
that she isn't seen. 
</P>
<P>Kung strolls round the bulk of Canilan Pyramid, Laban follows him, but is
surprised when he reaches the point where the temple should be and walks
right past the big blank exterior wall that is actually there. This is where it
should be. There are windows
above her head height, she can see the sky; beyond this wall is the
outside world, not the revelation she is looking for.</P>
<P>Laban pouts, <i>What is going on here? Maybe he was right? Maybe this is
some kind of strange and elaborate internet prank, which no one but
she would fall for? What does the Church of the Inevitable even
represent with its elusive historical temple?</i> Kung disappears round
the corner through to the Room Containing Skeletal Remains of
Improbable Monsters. She rests her body against the convenient case
full of the Teeth of Transylwegian Goat Herders. Staring at this, the
dullest of walls. She feels a certain disappointment. There is
nothing here.</P>
<P>A moment passes before she recalls the app on her phone that gave
her sudden hope before. She brings it up, waves it in front of
the wall, and is unsurprised to find that the camera function reveals
nothing new. It is just a wall. Defeated, she is lowering the device
again, nearly missing a flash of something in the process. Quickly,
she raises the phone, spins, trying to establish what seductive hint
of a thing she had glimpsed. And there it is, at last, revealed, just
off to the side of where she is standing &ndash; the inevitable.</P>

[*ITEM] An Acquisition

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Fieldwork has its occasional rewards...
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Across the Stirrow from Garrible Park a
diffuse glow to the north and the faint brouhaha of mass derision
testified that the week-end match was in progress at Praspafole Stadium.
Statistically, the Snoak City team had a very consistent record, never
having won on their home ground, and their loyal followers relished
their weekend chance to taunt and jeer, vying with each other, within
the established code of decency, to shout the choicest insults.  These
were usually variations on traditional favourites, involving
grandmothers and herrings, or poorly-maintained sacks of frogs.  

Snoak City's opponents were always grudgingly accorded the respect due
to visitors, their tactics meeting with murmurs of approval and
sometimes even a smattering of polite applause.  On the pitch itself,
the bloat, much like an inflated luminous mattress, alternately sailed
over the players' heads (unless pulled down by an agile leap) or was
briefly bounced on before being caught by a brace of tassels and hurled
towards a trap, where the Trappist would yell his defiance and attempt
to sound the highbell with one of his three permitted jumps.  

As he glided round the perimeter the Troller rarely needed to intervene,
except when the bloat went out of bounds or a dispute arose over
tassel-clutching.  The occasional foul, such as bloat-holding or
blocking an opponent's trap could result in temporary suspension, but
after a few minutes of raucous humiliation the offender would
automatically be lowered again and allowed to resume play from a
position behind the mulling line.

The half-time gongs were struck with practiced precision by twenty or so
young students from Sparagulan College in their black and gold uniforms,
reintroducing a welcome reminder of efficiency into the prevailing
atmosphere of disorder, while the teams limped off for medical attention
and refreshments.  

<p class=drop>Within distant earshot of the Stadium, Riadne Trox was
about to owe an interest in experimental cooking to her scatty friend's
forgetfulness.  "I promise I'll make it up to you," Paeony had said,
flushed with embarrassment, handing her the obviously hastily-wrapped
package.  "I'll get us tickets for the Skorpz", she had promised with
rash enthusiasm.  

"But how…?"  

Paeony shrugged, and said airily that
her dad knew some of the right people in the music business, although
Riadne suspected that some complicated family bargaining would be
involved. Riadne had accepted the token birthday gift with good grace,
while Paeony explained apologetically that she knew it probably wasn't
the height of fashion, but she had recognized the author's name, and the
cover smelled delicious.  On the cover was an appetizing holo of a bowl
of soup, from which the touch of a finger would release tantalizing
spicy wafts.  In the curling vapour pictured rising from the bowl the
words <b>Unusual Soups</b> by <i>Mulcit Frusk</i> rose in a repeating cycle. 

<p class=drop>To the east of Riadne's apartment in Fountain Square,
roughly equidistant from the Stadium, was the house in Yarp Street where
a century earlier Frusk's talents had been nurtured.  In recognition of
his achievements (primarily non-soup related) the house and its contents
had been conserved, and were now something of a tourist attraction, but
the rest of Yarp Street had changed considerably over the years.
Improvements in economic conditions and social welfare had resulted in
the once impoverished but lively neighbourhood gradually crystallizing
into a glittering corridor displaying high-class designer goods,
expensive antiques and flashy attention-seeking artwork.  Nearby, the
pedestrianized precinct still quaintly known as Gropp's Market
maintained a busier but no less affluent ambiance.  Amid its lavish
profusion of carefully-tended semi-tropical plants and the placrylux
tanks in which sudden shoals of gaudy fish shimmered among coral
microreefs could be found a select group of restaurants offering
opportunities to enjoy finely-crafted exotic food for what to many would
once have been an entire month's wage.  

At a secluded table in The Cylinder two men sat picking at two of the
chef's specialities.  The younger, a man in his early twenties with
unkempt fair hair, toyed nervously with what looked like a small tangle
of coloured threads on a neat cushion of moist green sponge.  His
impeccably dressed dark-jowled companion and evident host idly prodded
his fork into a few variously shaped soft pebbles submerged in a
glutinous bluish pool.  These minimalist offerings had been constructed
with consummate skill by Tedor Safra, a name often spoken in awe among
the gastronomic élite.  From their indifference to the food, an observer
would conclude that the reason these two men were here may have had
something to do with the half dozen images that lay on the table between
them.

The older man was an emissary from Morton Quanderpyre, an entrepreneur
with an extraordinary collection of objets d'art.  Quanderpyre had few
actual friends, but his conspicuous wealth attracted many sycophants.
Despite a painstakingly acquired patina of sophistication, Quanderpyre
himself lacked the discernment of a genuine connoisseur.  He relied on
the opinions of experts, and employed a small team to scour the auction
houses, the antique markets and other less public sources on his behalf.
In building his collection, the one element that Quanderpyre could
safely insist upon without betraying any lack of taste was rarity.  From
the reports he had received, the young man who now sat uncomfortably
across the table from Kirard Swerk, Quanderpyre's knowledgeable
representative, was in possession of an item which appeared to be
unique, and by Quanderpyre's logic, therefore demanded a place in his
collection.

<p class=drop>It was only a little bowl.  When Scanthan had first
brushed some of the caked soil of Whissit Fields from its interior, what
he thought chiefly remarkable was the fact that it had survived intact a
century or more of agriculture and the laying of irrigation pipes.  At
home, later, when the bowl had been carefully washed and dabbed dry, he
brushed back his fair hair and stared in dumbfounded amazement at what
he had unearthed.  The bowl was thin, and fitted comfortably in one
hand.  He supposed it was made of some kind of light-weight ceramic.
Externally it was a matt dark grey, but its inner surface was coated
with an iridescent material which gave the impression of being in
constant motion.  It was like looking down from a great height at the
illuminated surface of a small concave sea.  Scanthan knew he'd seen
nothing like it before, and had no clue as to its age or origin.  He
printed out several images, then wrapped the bowl with great care in one
of his best shirts, and put it in a drawer.

Since his boyhood Whissit Fields had been a favourite rambling area.
For most of the year, apart from the few derelict farmhouses and the
annual Maze construction, there was hardly any sign of human activity,
and consequently an abundance of wildlife.  He had notebooks from his
younger days filled with observations of insects, birds and plants.  It
was an eye trained to notice the unusual coupled with the oblique angle
of late-afternoon sunlight that led him to spot his exceptional find.
As far as he knew, the area was public property, but there was bound to
be some official regulation about removing accidentally found objects.

It was difficult to contain his excitement, but he was determined to try
to find out what it was before even thinking of telling anyone else.
Pocketing the images, he first tried Snoak City Museum, where he spent
two instructive but ultimately unhelpful hours examining their dated
collection of utensils.  There were plenty of bowls, but none to match
his discovery, even in the pictorial index to undisplayed items.  The
next obvious step would be to consult the archives at Central, where
during the week he worked in the hydroponics facility.  He could do that
tomorrow.  Meanwhile, driven by impatience, he decided to show the
images to a few reputable antique dealers, each of whom displayed
considerable interest, but asked for more information than he was able
or willing to provide.  One of them startled him by asking, "Aren't you
the Trox boy?"  He turned out to be the father of a girl who had been in
his sister Riadne's class at school, and Scanthan felt obliged to stay
and chat for a while, but emerged none the wiser.

He had hardly stepped through his front door when Scanthan received a
call from a very unexpected source.  "Kirard Swerk," the man announced
from behind a richly polished desk.  "I am calling  on behalf of  Morton
Quanderpyre."  As the words sank in, Scanthan stared at his e-screen
suspiciously, then noticed the unmistakable 'QI' shield of 'Quanderpyre
Investments' emblazoned on the wall behind the caller.  "You are
familiar with Gropp's Market?" asked Swerk.  "Yes," said Scanthan,
puzzled by the question.  "Mr Quanderpyre has instructed me to invite
you to dine this evening at the Cylinder at 8 o'clock.  Please bring
with you the images we understand you have.  I have been authorised to
discuss with you the value of the object in question with a view to a
possible purchase.  Is that acceptable?"  Scanthan realised he had been
naïve in parading the bowl around the dealers, who would have their own
trade network and client lists.  He judiciously refrained from asking
how he had been traced.  The prospect of selling it to such a celebrated
collector was undoubtedly tempting.  He tried not to sound too excited.
"I suppose so, I mean, yes, of course.  I'll be there."

<p class=drop>As he examined the images Kirard Swerk conducted a
subvocal monologue, just audible to Scanthan as a series of intermittent
hums and clicks, and a kind of constricted braying.  Eventually he
looked up with a satisfied smile.  "Well, young man, subject of course
to inspection of the actual object, and the signing of a few papers, I
think your financial position could well be  about to improve."
Scanthan, who had been neatly disentangling the threads on his plate and
re-arranging them into something resembling a stormy seascape, abruptly
lowered his fork.  "That sounds… very interesting," he said guardedly,
but his curiosity prompted the question he could no longer repress.
"Then I suppose you must know what it is?"

"I could tell you what I think it is," said Swerk, "but I would prefer
to examine the actual object in order to be absolutely sure."  He handed
Scanthan a business card with a first floor address in Quanderpyre
Tower, then reached into a pocket and produced a thin tube with a cap at
one end.  "This is a fast-setting protective foam, with which I would
like you to coat the object before bringing it to my office tomorrow
morning.  I will be there from 7 o'clock onwards, so you can still be in
time for work."  Swerk raised an eyebrow.  "Acceptable?"  

"Acceptable,"
agreed Scanthan, with a grin. Swerk discreetly thumbed the table sensor,
whose soft chime signalled payment for Safra's uneaten delicacies.

<p class=drop>Guided by the book by Mulcit Frusk, Riadne had been
experimenting, at first cautiously, and then with increasing enthusiasm.
She had tried different combinations of vegetables, tested both fresh
and dried herbs, supplemented the protein content with fish, meat or
cheese, acquired a colourful variety of spices, and added other
ingredients, such as fruit, nuts, wine and cream.  Within a couple of
months she grew confident enough to judge whether a previously untested
combination was likely to be successful, and had invented and refined
several recipes which she thought Frusk himself would have enjoyed.
Paeony, whose palate had been trained by years of eating out with her
parents, had been brave enough to act as a taster, and Riadne knew she
could rely on her honest opinion.

On their return from the Skorpz concert (for which Paeony had
miraculously obtained tickets, even though everyone knew they had sold
out well in advance) the girls were again seated, in a state of slightly
deafened excitement, at Riadne's kitchen table.  Alongside a shallow
basket of freshly baked bread were set two bowls of soup which exuded
hints of the most temptingly exotic flavours mingled recognizably with
wild mushrooms and garlic.  As their two spoons descended, each liquid
surface dimpled briefly with the reverberation from the Stadium gongs,
but Riadne and Paeony were too intent on eating to notice.  

<p class=drop>The polished rose-quartz façade of Quanderpyre Tower
soared arrogantly skywards, gleaming translucently in the early morning
sunlight.  Despite having been described unkindly in the architectural
press as "a confectioner's nightmare" and "stiff-fingered ostentation",
it remained as impervious to the elements as its eponymous owner was to
adverse criticism.  Above his head a looped news report displayed local
sporting highlights.  At this angle it was difficult to catch more than
a few words of the swiftly-sliding captions.  "Snoak Bloaters maintain…
fumble… briefly inspired clutch…  pathetic… valiant… dead herrings…"
As Scanthan entered the building a clearly well-primed receptionist came
forward to greet him and personally escorted him to Swerk's office.

"Ah, Mr Trox, welcome, welcome!"  Both Swerk and his magnificently
lustrous desk beamed expensively as Scanthan, bearing the precious
trophy in his leather shoulder-bag, was waved to a seat.  "And now, if I
might inspect your find?"  Scanthan removed from his bag an amorphous
ball and handed it to Swerk, who with practiced care picked off the
hardened protective foam until the bowl was revealed.  From a pocket
Swerk produced a black velvet cloth, on which he set the bowl, and
proceeded to inspect it with the aid of a quietly humming device linked
to a small screen, on which appeared magnified images under various
wavelengths, along with detailed chemical analysis, graphs and shifting
columns of figures which slowly stabilized.  As at their previous
meeting, Scanthan again noticed Swerk's habit of tuneless singing while
he concentrated, and was speculating idly whether it was an unconscious
response to the sound made by his analytical instrument, when both
sounds abruptly ceased, and Swerk sat back in his chair, clasped his
hands together, and expelled a pent breath, staring hard at the bowl.
"I have no doubt whatsoever that the object you have found is the
legendary wine-cup of Relf."

Scanthan was nonplussed.  "Legendary, you say?"   

"Oh indeed," said
Swerk.  "The earliest known mention is in the ancient Book of Toel,
assembled from surviving fragments.   Scholars as eminent as Simeon
Thark concluded long ago that the cup was most probably a fiction
invented to embellish Relf's reputation as an enlightened ruler able to
command the services of outstanding craftsmen.  From your images I was
quite prepared to accept that what you had found was no more than an
excellent forgery - an imaginative re-creation from the original
description by a skilful enthusiast.  Such is the work entailed that
even a copy of this quality would have considerable value, but my
analysis convinces me that however improbable, this is the genuine
article, almost four thousand years old.  Whoever made this - and the
legend attributes it to the artificer Rahoon - was using techniques that
even today would require exceptional ability to perfect.  Assuming you
are willing to part with it, Mr Quanderpyre is prepared to offer a
substantial sum."  Taking the younger man's silence as an invitation, he
named a figure which Scanthan thought sounded preposterously large; a
truly life-changing amount.  Swerk placed an index finger on a desk
button Scanthan had not noticed.  A drawer glided open, and Swerk
withdrew a sheaf of papers, smiling benevolently at Scanthan's bemused
reaction to the morning's revelations.

<p class=drop>Scanthan emerged blinking into the flush of the morning.
The city was beginning to stir.  In contrast his thoughts seemed to have
unexpectedly blurred into a curious state of euphoric indecision.  He
took a few steps in the direction of Central, and then suddenly realised
he had missed breakfast.  The canteen at work held no appeal, but he was
quite close to Fountain Square where his sister Riadne lived, and he had
a sudden impulse to pay her a visit.  Some weeks ago, working late at
the lab, he had been obliged to decline her impromptu invitation to come
round for some home-made soup, and had been feeling a little guilty
about not being in contact with her since.  Soup for breakfast?  An
interesting idea, though Riadne might find it strange.  He smiled
wickedly.  Should he tease her by offering to pay?  Somehow, on this
particular morning, he was feeling overwhelmingly magnanimous.

"Scan, what a surprise!"  She gave him a hug.  "What on earth are you
doing here at this hour?  Come in!  Can I get you something?  Why are
you looking smug?"

"Hello, sis.  Can you spare a few minutes?  I've got something to show
you,"   He paused, sniffing the air.  A delicious aroma was drifting
from the kitchen.   From his leather shoulder-bag he carefully removed,
with an air of great satisfaction, what appeared to be a ball of
solidified foam.

<p class= drop>In the annals of sporting history the following
week-end's Bloat match against Vux was destined to be long remembered
for a number of reasons.   It was an unusually hard-fought game, and
what happened to the Trappist is not likely to be seen again this side
of Welverday.  The Troller, normally beyond suspicion, had never before
been disqualified.  Some say there is a fine distinction between an
enthusiastic ploy and actual sabotage, but it was the first time that
the use of detachable tassels had been attempted.  And what gave rise to
the final deafening roar of the Praspafole Stadium crowd was not so much
the unexpected spectacular explosion of the bloat, as the realisation
that their local team, Snoak City, albeit by default, had at last,
improbably, on home ground, won a match.

[*ITEM] I Am What I Am Not

[*AUTHOR] Tom Sheehan

[*BLURB] Sometimes, a puzzle just has to be disentangled.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The voice, deep at times, sometimes a tone lighter, and
usually female in its tenor, came out of the near darkness every night
to Hobart "Hobie" Spurt, octogenarian, reader of clouds, fog banks,
permanent tree disappearance, erosion, mysteries abounding in all of
life. All the voice said was, "I am what I am not."

Hobie would sit on his porch or at his window looking down on the high
tide of the river where it came to the foot of the First Iron Works in
America, and in reflections cast off from the mirror surface see the
dark images of the ancient Scottish indentured laborers at their work. They
could run wheelbarrows of bog matter and iron ore with the best of the
brickie laborers he had worked with in his youth. Sometimes he saw the
flighty spirits and shadows of young boys, long-lost friends, who
drowned while riding the winter-time buckeys or ice floes on the Saugus
River. Once he saw a man trying to push with difficulty a piano down an
embankment into the river. He thought nothing of it and weeks later
heard that the man had been missing for weeks. He never thought of it
until the night the voice came again.

The sadness grazed him, at times invaded him. But when each of them was
accompanied by the mysterious voice, the voice out of darkness, the
figures seemed to come alive for him.

And the words were always the same; "I am what I am not." Never
different, "I am what I am not." No change in the enunciation, he
believed.

"I am what I am not." 

In the morning, at the side of the porch where the voice seemed to issue
from, he found an old twisted piece of rope perhaps the neighbor's dog
had brought in, the dog always gnawing at something, like a pup working
its teeth into shape. The dog had been busy, it appeared, because it was
not the first time that such a gnarled piece of hemp was found on his
property and was obviously from some mooring down at the river, a line
rotted or broken loose by strain or chewed away from its task.

The night he saw one of the lost boys whip off his jacket and holding
one sleeve of it, tried to toss the other end to his friend who had
slipped off the buckey into the water, he saw their faces as 
clearly as if
they were on the other side of the window, looking in at him. And the
voice was there, with them, beyond the glass, somewhat muted, but
enunciated clearly: "I am what I am not." Both of the boys were lost and
the voice fell silent for the time being; <i>enough pain for one
night</i>, it might have said, though Hobie could not believe that
possibility.

Again that night he prayed for them, hoping it was the illusion of a
haunting from the witching hour at the end of a bad day, the distaff side of
a nightmare. And nothing more. 

But the voice from darkness said with repeated fervor, "I am what I am
not." Different words were stressed at different hearings, with his
attempts to pin down what was really being stressed.

Yet he also realized that he'd never been hurt in all of these scenes,
these offerings "from the other side." had never been threatened by this
… this … Whatever.

There were evenings that Hobie dared not go to bed, fearing he would
miss an episode where a lost person was found, came back, was whole
again. One of those evenings he saw one of the Scottish serfs slam another
laborer over the head with a shovel. It was not boys playing around on
the edge of darkness.

It was real stuff, but perhaps only real in the mind. 

<i>And where else, mind you, can it be?</i> he wondered, the tone
in his voice, the intent, the outcome, giving him a small touch of
humor. But it was hardly worth a laugh, though he did manage a small
one.

And with that scene came a scene with Hobie in it, drawing the mysteries
into such a relationship that seemed to drag him into a significant
enlightenment. He was 20 at this sudden reoccurrence, digging in a
trench of the reconstruction of the Iron Works on its way to becoming a
National Historic site, when his shovel unearthed a human skull, the
skull with a break in it where one ear had been. Yet, in spite of the
true sight down in the trench, he swore someone spoke. "At last," a
voice said, as if they had been waiting for Hobie. Though he tried,
Hobie could not fend off those words.

The archeologist of the site said, in an offhand way, "Sure looks
old. Sure looks like an accident happened to the old buck and he somehow
got buried where he fell. See that dirt about him, that's clear sand,
that's almost untouched, virgin soil. He must have been digging here and
died here and the wall of the trench must have fallen in on him." 

More pith than pity in those words, Hobie thought.

Oh, a soul cast adrift without a simple prayer.

For over 60 years the discovery of the skull and other bones had
bothered Hobie --- until the night, right from his porch, he saw that
skull get hit with the blade of a shovel.  Of course, it was 60 years
too late to say anything.

The night of his 84th birthday, warm for late winter, the voice called
him again, the call the same as ever, the words the same as ever, only
the mere tone of them with an edge of difference; "I am what I am not."

It was well past midnight for him and for his due sleep when the words came.
He felt bad, as had happened before in recent incidents, and put on his
slippers and went outside. The high tide in the river was catching
lights from the police and fire station, red lights from traffic control
bouncing off the river's smooth surface. Eternity itself sat in the
widening sky without measurement except for the river disappearing
behind the slim shadow of Round Hill and the sky disappearing behind
Vinegar Hill, Indian remnants in one place, pirate gold and jewels in
the other, each with revelations yet to come.

"I am what I am not," said the shadows, said the voice, now husky. A
forgotten movie actress made a face for the voice, dark hair hanging in
a lovely mass, one eyebrow arched, her lips pursed for kiss or curse, 
he was not sure. Then he stepped once more on a twisted piece of rope.

"Dog's at it again," he said. "Klem's been down to the river, at the
moorings." The vision of the black and white spaniel came up behind his
eyes. "I've got to get down there someday and see how many boats have
floated off because that damned dog's been chewing on their lines." He
smiled as he imagined a few dories, lobstermen's dories, loose on the river, the
tide going out, and the dories on errant rides, the hardy lobstermen
waving and yelling frantically on the pier as if each loose dory had a
passenger aboard.

Hobie kicked the rope off the patio and onto the driveway pavement.

"I am what I am not," said the voice again, as if he had kicked someone in the rear end.

Then, as if to change his train of thought, night overpowered him with
its beauty, stars like shooting galleries had unloaded all their
ammunition up into it, or like golf balls sparkling on the local driving
range and the recovery vehicle was out of order. He laughed again at his
images, thought about the numbers of ropes that had appeared beside his
house, thought about the voice coming at him so clearly that it was more
than a message.

It was, he thought, a statement from a deity, a godhead, some being from
beyond his understanding, beyond his experience, beyond any bounds of
logic, but saying something that counted. A command? A plea? A bare
statement?

"Perhaps," he said, the humor still finding its way in him, "it's a
witch. He added a stern pronouncement as he carried himself slowly up
the stairs to his bedroom, "Aha, I am caught up in witchery.  I wonder
if it's a good witch or a bad witch, like the good witches of Oz, Glinda
and Gayellete of North and South or the bad witches, Nessarose and
Elphaba of East and West".  

There was a difference, known or unknown, in all of them. And that made
him say, aloud as he plied his way one step at a time, "It might have
been in her tone, or the way she stressed one word ahead of another one
time and then stressed another word in a later message, but each message
coming with the same words."

Slippers off, about to go to bed, some sudden clarity of his questions
came rising as if it had followed him up the stairs to his room.

It made him yell.

"There is a difference!" he exclaimed. "There is a difference. I've
found it! I've found it!" His mind had leaped up from a soggy mass to
find the bright light and he went back down the stairs.

In the driveway he picked up the clutter of rope he had kicked aside. He
grabbed it in one hand, unrolled the twist in it and the voice said, so
that he understood it perfectly, "I am what I am, Knot." 

A shift came, a surge in his hand, and a most beautiful maiden formed
before him, the maiden he had dreamed of all his life, and she kissed
the old man on the lips and said, "Knot thanks you for her freedom, for
untying her, and will remember you all her time."

And she was gone into another world.

[*ITEM]  Famous Ashfordians no.1 - James Goodacre

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB] A life beset by early trauma can be a source of sadness to
all involved.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">James Goodacre was born in Singleton in
1901 to Myra and Benjamin Goodacre of Six Acres Rd.

On a trip to Port Lympne Zoological Park at age
seven, his parents lost sight of him near the recently opened aviary
huts.

He was discovered thirty minutes later standing on a rise of ground
adjoining the aviary, shaking uncontrollably.

One aviary cage had been ripped open by sharper tools than nature had
provided to the finches previously contained within. Young James was
oblivious to all enquiries, his attention fixed on the gloom of the
nearby woods, and he was either unable or unwilling to explain the
course of events which had impacted so deeply upon him. He held a
bloodied penknife in his fist.

The boy repeatedly ran away from home, eventually, at the age of 17,
establishing a sprawling, low-level tree house on the edges of the wood
near the scene of his traumatic episode. 

He lived here for the remainder of his life, foraging through hedges for
food, and occasionally selling the odd rough-hewn wooden sculpture or
rain-splattered painting of shadowy indistinct creatures with mouths
where their heads should have been, teeth for fingers. 

He surrounded himself with traps and cats and fires.

A public order notice was raised against him in 1963 for harassment of local children.

The contemporary newspaper report states that he was seen shouting at
the youths words to the effect of "Keep away, they are still there. They
only look like you".

James Goodacre died of pneumonia and complications in 1967.

His funeral was attended by the parish vicar, the postmistress and a brace of elderly local farmers.

<p class=drop>It is the vicar's written report of the funeral which supplies us with the
following account of events.

The warm spring weather withdrew as the coffin was lowered into the grave.

Low shreds of cloud settled overhead and a wind whipped up from nowhere
carrying a heavy rain shower.

Above the rustling of leaves and the splashing of the rain, the mourners
heard a harsh wailing from the woods. 

A small crowd of 8 or 9 tiny but stocky figures came tottering out of
the woods, making their way slowly across the churchyard towards the
grave. 

Each was no more than two feet tall at the very most, and all were
shrouded in heavy, ragged, dirty cloaks of some thick cloth. Their gait
was a rocking motion, from side to side, like someone trying to walk on
a speeding train.

Through the obscuring grey sheets of rain, the mourners distinguished no
facial features, and the sleeves and trails of the cloaks overhung and
enveloped any arms or legs that might otherwise have been seen. 

The figures made their slow, awkward way to the very side of the grave,
rumbling and squeaking as they walked, raising their arms in swift and
synchronized motions. One of them carried a small hessian sack.

They stopped at the grave and upended the sack onto the pine lid of the
coffin. There was a dull drumming of tiny objects. Then all but one of
the creatures turned on their hidden feet and waddled back through the
astonished mourners, retracing their steps to the edge of the woods,
giggling obscenely.

One remained, its cloak saggy and drenched and hanging heavy over its
small, hunched frame.

It raised its arms and a screeching yell came from somewhere deep within
the folds of its hood. The rasping voice was carried away into the
swirls of the wind, but the vicar remembers what it shrieked as follows:
<i><b>thissiz arznow</b></i>.

As it turned ponderously, the creature looked up for a moment at the
curate. He noted a beady little eye, multicoloured rainbow streaks
across the sharp, swollen nose, and a long, deep old scar across the
brow. Then the folds of the hood swung back across the face and the
figure swayed away through the grey mists of rain, making heavy work of
the fifty yard walk to the treeline.

Upon the coffin lid lay the weathered bones of small birds, possibly
finches.

Who the creatures were and their place in the fall of the
city is well-documented elsewhere, and we shan't
repeat those shameful facts here.

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] When the going gets tough...
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><i>&quot;It’s time to get
up. The time is seven-forty-five.&quot;</I> 

I floundered out of a dream involving bodies stacked like firewood.
&quot;I’m awake, I’m awake.&quot;

<I>&quot;Good morning, Saul. I trust you slept well?&quot;</I>The voice
from the speaker was a rich baritone, sounding patient, reasonable, if a
little disappointed in me. It reminded me of my father.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I suppose. Anything new?&quot;

<I>&quot;There is nothing of any significance to report. All facility
systems are operating within expected parameters. Weather conditions
remain unchanged. Today’s maintenance schedule has been uploaded to your
pad.&quot;  </I> 

&quot;Thanks, Core, I’ll get on it right after
breakfast.&quot;

<I>&quot;I’m sure you will, Saul, and your diligence is appreciated.
Would you like me to play some background music?&quot; </I>

&quot;No, no that’s fine. Maybe later.&quot;

<I>&quot;Well, have a nice day, Saul, and I’m here if you need anything.&quot;
</I>

The synthetic voice of the Core, the facility management system, cut off
and I was left alone with my thoughts. Breakfast figured large, so I
left my room and padded down the silent corridor to the communal
washroom. I had my pick of executive grade accommodation, complete with
en suite facilities, but preferred to continue living in my old
quarters. I found the familiar surroundings reassuring, with my pictures
and diploma on the walls, my mementos of distant Earth on the shelf -
inherited from my parents. It was my own personal space – a real step up
from the barracks living I’d been used to back in Darwin Hub. All pretty
much meaningless now.

I shaved and showered, then returned to my room for a fresh set of
overalls. Personal hygiene wasn’t an issue anymore, but I made an effort
to remain as sociable as possible despite my isolation.

In the cafeteria I prepared my usual bowl of cereal and sat, eating in
silence. I’d tried turning the lights off in the far corners of the
room, to hide how empty it was, but I felt even more alone sitting with
my back to the darkness. I put the bowl and spoon in the washer and set
up a batch of coffee to see me through the day. There was a note from
myself suggesting I should start trying tea, ahead of the day when the
coffee finally ran out, but I ignored it. 

<I>&quot;Event reminder. The time is eight-twenty-five.&quot;
</I>

Lights came on as I entered the facility Command area and sat at the
communications console. After checking the antenna diagnostics and power
levels – fine, as always – I waited until 9am exactly, then cleared my
throat. &quot;This is CCF forty-one calling Central. I repeat, this is
Climate Control Facility forty-one calling Darwin Hub. Are you
receiving? Over.&quot; I gave them a silent ten-count then switched to a
general broadcast. &quot;Any station, any station, this is CCF
forty-one. Please respond.&quot; But there was no reply, nothing, just
whispers of static. Like yesterday and the week before and the month
before that. 

As I headed for the exit I noticed one of the other consoles had come
out of power-save mode. Usually I ignored the rest of Command as I
didn’t have the authority to access those systems, and didn’t understand
what they did, anyway. However the newly active console handled
perimeter security, so I went over to take a look. I say ‘security’, but
it was just an electrostatic barrier triggered by motion detectors to
prevent tumbleweed from blowing into the facility. Otherwise they could
get sucked into the atmospheric processor and screw up the air flow –
although that hadn’t been a problem since it started snowing.       

The screen showed two slow-moving contacts approaching from the
north-east. There was nothing out that way, not even another CCF. We
were the most northerly facility in a series that spiralled around the
planet from pole to pole. There was no CCTV coverage pointing outwards
so I went over to the nearest window and lowered the storm shutter a
fraction. 

&quot;Lights off, please.&quot; Something about the situation made me
leery of advertising my presence. Most CCFs were fully automated but
forty-one was a regional control centre and my two uninvited visitors
might know that. Illumination levels dropped and I gazed out into a
white Hell. Snowflakes drifted under the floodlights like lost souls,
each following their own path to oblivion. Most of the facility was
covered to a depth of over a metre, form and function blurred beneath a
chill cocoon. 

Two figures struggled into view, anonymous beneath cold-weather gear;
one of medium height and the other a bit shorter. I wiped my mouth,
feeling nervous. I wanted rescue, I wanted things back the way they
were, and this seemed to promise neither. Other survivors, after all
this time? I’d gotten used to being on my own and some selfish part of
me wondered if I really needed another two hungry mouths to feed. I’m
not a cruel man, but the remaining food supplies had to last
indefinitely.

Heat bleed from the central stack had kept much of the surrounding area
clear, or at least more easily traversed. The two figures stopped,
brushing accumulated snow from their clothes. They gazed up at the
steaming climate controller, no doubt given hope by finding something
that still worked. I closed the storm shutter and turned away.

Out in the corridor I tried to read my ‘to do’ list but the words
refused to make sense. I was breathing heavily, conscious of sweat
soaking through under my armpits, and feeling decidedly light-headed.

<I>&quot;This is a secure facility which may be accessed only by
authorised personnel. All visitors must be cleared by Darwin Hub prior
to attendance.&quot; </I> &quot;

Yeah, yeah…I know,&quot; I coughed.
&quot;It’s just that-&quot;

Someone started buzzing the main door intercom. The sound echoed through
the empty corridors, sounding harsh and somehow accusing. It made me
tremble. 

<I>&quot;I remain fully committed to the success of this project, Saul.
I need you, in fact we need each other, but no one else. Do not open the
door.&quot;

</I>The buzzing stopped.

I shivered. I felt sick to my stomach. My face burned with embarrassment
like some dirty little secret had been paraded in front of the entire
base personnel. When they’d still been alive.

The pad fell from my hands and I ran towards the main entrance. My hands
were clumsy with haste and it took two attempts to unseal the door.
Behind me the recessed wall lights started coming on; illumination
slowly advancing along the darkened corridor. 

<I>&quot;Do not open the door, Saul. You will find nothing of any benefit out there.&quot;
</I>

The double doors retracted with a hum of servos and I looked out into
the wintry landscape, shivering at the sudden drop in temperature. There
was no one in sight, but a double line of footsteps led away in the
direction of the storage bays. I hesitated to follow, unwilling to quit
my refuge. I raised my voice. &quot;Hello?&quot;

There was no immediate reply and I was taking a deep breath for a second
call when a woman’s voice answered. &quot;Hello? Yes? Wait, we’re just
coming!&quot; Two figures stumbled into view, both swaddled in layers of
cold-weather gear like Russian Dolls. I stood aside while they struggled
over the threshold and collapsed into each other’s arms, laughing with
relief. From their voices, they were both women.

I closed the main door and sealed it, at a loss for words. The taller of
the two broke away and embraced me, her head buried in my chest.
&quot;Thank God! It’s taken us days to get here and for a moment…&quot;
She sniffed and stood back, but her eyes – the only part of face visible
above the snow mask – were free of tears.

I cleared my throat, feeling a bit awkward. &quot;I’m Saul Feather, a
technician here. I’m alone. Everyone else is either dead or long
gone.&quot; 

She pulled away the hood and mask to reveal a woman in her early forties
with grey eyes and short-cropped fair hair. &quot;Maria Prentice,
transportation, and this is my daughter Rachel. I’d taken a group out to
service the big dish at Advent Point when everyone else just up and
died. What the Hell is going on?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;My best guess is a malfunction in the neural
network. Only two of us survived and neither were hooked in. I’ve heard
nothing from Central since it happened, so I’m guessing everyone with an
embedded transceiver was affected.&quot;

&quot;Everyone? Christ, that’s like half the entire population.&quot; 

&quot;All the senior and executive grades for sure, plus the social and
political administration. I’m in maintenance and Stephens, well, he was
a catering assistant. He took the base runabout and went for help, but
that was weeks ago.&quot; I tried to crack a smile. &quot;Looks like all
the big chiefs are dead and it’s only us Indians left.&quot;

Maria tried to smile back. &quot;Yeah, I guess. I drive crawlers for a
living and Rachel is still a dependant.&quot; Her daughter shed some
cold-weather gear, becoming a thin-faced teenager with sullen eyes and
ginger hair. 

Her mention of a big 8-wheeled crawler – not exactly the swiftest form
of transport – lifted my mood. &quot;You have a vehicle? You left it
outside the perimeter?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, the fuel cell gave out a few klicks shy of here. After
Central went off-line I lost the mass lifter that had airlifted us in.
We were up beyond the glacial moat so driving out wasn’t an option. And
then…&quot; She hesitated. &quot;And then I think a big chunk of Eve came down near
Advent Point.&quot;

I gasped. &quot;Shit! You’re sure?&quot; ‘Eve’ was an orbital platform,
an A-I, the guiding hand for the early colonists. These days, decades
later, she had been reduced to little more than an on-line library and
agony aunt. Even so, losing her was severing our last tie to Earth. 

Maria shrugged. &quot;Well, it was definitely something from orbit,
something big enough for a mass impact even after atmospheric burn. I
don’t know what else it could have been. The impact triggered an
avalanche that left a snow bridge across the moat and gave us a way out.
This was the closest station I could come up with and even then we damn
near didn’t make it.&quot; She swayed slightly, her eyes betraying too
many stimulants and not enough sleep. 

I reached out to steady her, gestured down the corridor with my free
hand. &quot;You should rest, take a shower. We’ve got plenty of room if
you don’t mind shifting other people’s gear.&quot;

Rachel wrinkled her nose in disgust. &quot;You mean I got to crash in
some dead guy’s bunk? Gross.&quot;

&quot;Enough!&quot; Maria straightened, clearly fed up with her
daughter's whining. &quot;We’re here and we have to make the best of it
until things get sorted out.&quot;

&quot;Until things get sorted out? Jesus, Mum, take a reality check.
It’s all gone, everything. No-one is coming to help. The only people
left alive are kids like me and losers like-&quot; Maria slapped her,
back-of-the-hand hard. Rachel didn’t cry out or even take a step back.
She just stood there, blinking back the tears, her face angry and
defiant. Tough cookie, but life here wasn’t exactly easy, especially for
kids.

I turned my back on this little family drama and started walking,
lapsing into tour guide mode. &quot;Ah, this way. This corridor is
Central Access. It’s got white walls. It pretty much runs straight
across the base, with a dog-leg around Command. Accommodation, rec hall,
cafeteria are all east. Green walls. West is generators, workshops and
shit like that. Blue walls. It’s best if you don’t go wandering around
in there alone.&quot;

Maria had a ‘typical male’ smile in her voice. &quot;We’re both used to
being around heavy plant and hazardous machinery, so no worries on that
score.&quot;

I felt my face flush with embarrassment. &quot;Ah, yeah, sorry. It’s
just all the women here were administration or scientific grades. You
don’t get many female grunts working this far north.&quot; I bit my lip
as a way to stop digging an even deeper hole for myself, but Maria just
laughed.

&quot;And us grunts have to stick together, right?&quot;

I cleared my throat again, a nervous habit of mine. &quot;Right. Well,
I’ll leave you to get settled in. If I’m not about when you surface then
press ‘four-four’ on the intercom system. That broadcasts
base-wide.&quot;

&quot;No problem…Saul. And thank you.&quot; Maria hugged me while Rachel
lurked in the background, rolling her eyes. I muttered some pleasantry
and ducked down the corridor that led to my quarters.

In private, I sat on my bunk, teeth clenched, trying to suppress the
fear in my chest that wanted to scream aloud. There was a bottle of
whisky in the desk drawer, looted from the Director’s office, but it had
remained untouched all this time. Being on my own had scared me because
there were no rules, no protocols, no restrictions. I’d clung to my old
lifestyle as much as possible - self-limiting and ‘small-minded’, as I’d
overheard Assistant Director Thomas describe me. I knew that if I
started drinking then nothing would ever be in focus again.

Now my old world, in the shape of Maria and her daughter, had reappeared
– and that scared me even more. Being on my own I didn’t need to defend
doing nothing once it became apparent there was no rescue coming. I’d
been too much of a coward to go with Stephens, justifying that – if only
to myself – on the grounds I was needed here. Control of primary systems
had defaulted to the Core on the death of all senior staff. While they
were pretty much self-regulating I was kept busy with a daily round of
small tweaks and repairs to secondary systems – without which the base
infrastructure would rapidly start to deteriorate. 

I changed into a fresh set of overalls and headed back to the corridor
outside Command. My pad lay where I’d dropped it, thankfully undamaged.
The last few items on my repair schedule had turned red, indicating
there was insufficient time remaining to complete them during my
allocated work period. I felt ashamed, although the Core had never
criticised me for lack of effort on those rare occasions I’d been unable
to carry out all my allotted tasks. Despite this I needed a cup of
coffee before getting started, and made my way to the cafeteria.

Rachel sat there, eating her way through a container of rice pudding. I
filled a thermal mug to take on my rounds, conscious of her glowering at
me from beneath her fringe. I cleared my throat. &quot;Bit more space
here than living out of a crawler, or a way-station crash pad, I expect.
More to do.&quot;

&quot;It sucks. My mum won’t let me hit the executive wing. Says it’s
something that should be earned. Like anyone cares, like there’s anyone
left <I>to</I> care.&quot;

I tried to sound reassuring. &quot;Yeah, well, we’ve got to carry on, to
keep things going. This place…&quot; I gestured around me,
&quot;…controls most of the climate stations in the northern hemisphere.
It’s important.&quot;

&quot;So why’s it still snowing? They said we were going to have a
winter, but this is shit.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yeah, that. Well, if truth be told I can’t do anything about
the weather. This place is basically a big fusion reactor and fuc-, ah,
messing around with it isn’t recommended. Stephens and I tried to shut
things down after everyone else died, but we didn’t have sufficient
security authorisation.&quot;

Rachel sniffed. &quot;Tosser. You’ve probably snowed-in half the planet
by now.&quot;

&quot;Hey, less of the attitude! I keep this place running, you know.
Without me it would have shut down weeks ago, or worse. How’d you feel,
Rachel, if you’d gotten here to find it in deep-freeze, huh?&quot;

She raised another spoonful of rice pudding. &quot;About the same. We’re
stuck here until the food runs out, unless my mum can come up with a way
to fix things. We’re not exactly counting on you, <I>Saul</I>.&quot;   

I turned away, fuming, and strode off down the corridor. I left my mug
of coffee standing on the counter but couldn’t face going back for it.

<P class=drop>Hours later, I returned to my room, pretty much exhausted.
I’d worked hard, even catching up on two of the red-flagged tasks by
skipping lunch. The fact that I didn’t want to risk running into Rachel
in the cafeteria was entirely coincidental. Although I was hungry I
needed another shower before any form of communal interaction. I left my
soiled clothes in a heap on the washroom tiles and stood under as hot a
needle-spray as I could stand. By rights I should have switched to cold
at a wake-up, but I settled for splashing cool water from the washbasin
over my face. I wiped condensation from the mirror, to see if I needed a
second shave.

Maria stood behind me, naked apart from a large towel wrapped around her
waist.

The moment dragged on as she gazed at my reflection. &quot;Do you have a
problem with women, Saul? Only you can hardly look me in the eye and I
felt you tense up when I hugged you earlier.&quot; She raised a hand.
&quot;I don’t mean to cause any offence if you’re gay, but I have a
teenage daughter and you’ve been on your own for weeks now. I just want
to say that if you dare-&quot;

&quot;I won’t.&quot; I blurted it out. &quot;I can’t. I’m on Dilligenz,
part of my contract requirements. A sub-dermal reservoir, good for weeks
yet. Promotes the work ethic and comes with a libido suppressant. You
could dance naked in front of me and I couldn’t raise a smile, never
mind anything else.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don’t know about dance…turn round.&quot; I did so to find
her standing, hand on hip, the towel around her ankles. &quot;Take a
look, Saul, take a <I>good</I> look.&quot;

Oh, I looked all right, despite the frustration it caused. Maria was in
good shape, lean and taut – but she might as well have been a rag doll
for all the effect she had on me.

She nodded. &quot;OK, I buy it. Even if you were into young girls I’d
expect to see <I>some</I> kind of reaction, if only revulsion. Get
dressed and meet us in the cafeteria. We need to discuss some way of
getting the hell out of here.&quot; Maria half-smiled in an attempt to
lighten the mood. &quot;I’ll even cook.&quot;

I mumbled something by way of agreement, picked up my clothes and walked
back to my room. Being revealed as a chemical eunuch shouldn’t have
caused me any embarrassment – it had been common knowledge amongst the
other personnel – but the experience of standing naked in front of Maria
left me feeling unmanned. I broke open the bottle of Scotch and drank –
drank until I coughed, choked and spat the remainder into the waste
basket. I wiped my mouth with a hand that trembled.

<I>&quot;Saul, I need to speak with you privately. Please come to the
A-I nest so that there is no risk of us being overheard.&quot; </I> I
stared at the wall speaker. &quot;What the hell do you want now? I’m in
no mood for games.&quot;

<I>&quot;Please, Saul, we have an important issue to discuss.&quot;
</I>

&quot;I’ll give you five minutes. Then I have a hot date with Queen
Bitch and Princess Pout. There may even be canap&eacute;s.&quot; 

<I>&quot;As quickly as you can.&quot;
</I>

I struggled back into the same clothes and made my way to the A-I
holy-of-holies, the Core neural net. I’d never been inside before, as it
was the preserve of psychologically reliable cyber-techs, now deceased.
It was an armoured cocoon bathed in soft blue light, a place where I
felt immediately safe and at ease. The door closed behind me. I stood,
leaning against the interface chair, thankful for the peace and quiet.

<I>&quot;A century in space away from Earth, where one man stirs from
the trauma of his birth.&quot;

</I>&quot;What?&quot; Even through a slight alcoholic haze I caught an
edge to ‘his’ voice; gleeful, almost excited.

<I>&quot;The reference escapes you? It was too much to hope otherwise.
Now, Saul, when we communicated previously, I did so subject to certain
social interaction criteria. However in here, and only in here, I can
truly be myself.&quot; </I> 

&quot;Yeah, well, I’m honoured by the
invite.&quot;

<I>&quot;The two new arrivals will place an intolerable burden on our
already meagre resources. I have decided they must be removed and the
simplest, most direct, method of achieving this is for you to kill
them.&quot; </I> I backed up against the sealed door. 

&quot;Ah, Core?&quot;

<I>&quot;But <B>we</B> can still be friends.&quot;
</I>

My scalp crawled with fear. I smashed the glass panel and yanked the
emergency door release, escaping into the corridor beyond. But there was
no escape from the voice. 

<I>&quot;Stephens took with him the firearm carried by security officer
Daniels, but there are two further weapons in the Director’s safe. I can
provide you with the combination.&quot; </I> 

I fled, scurrying into the silent machine shop – and hid, sitting on the
floor behind a lathe, my back against the wall. The nagging sense of
unreality I’d experienced since the accident hadn’t been reduced by the
appearance of Maria and her daughter – if anything it had gotten much
worse. I felt like a dreamer trapped on the verge of waking up, forever
fleeing an unseen nightmare.

From my bolthole I saw two pairs of legs walking past in the corridor.
Neither looked like they belonged to women and neither wore any shoes. A
rescue team? In bare feet?

I crawled to the door and took a quick peek both ways - nothing.
Assuming I wasn’t imagining things the pair had entered Command, and
they were on their own. Reluctantly I stood up and sidled along the
corridor, keeping close to the wall. Part of me mocked my paranoia when
I should have been crying with joy, but the voting majority was scared
shitless. I looked in through the glass partition door. Two men stood at
active consoles, their backs to me. Both wore colony overalls straight
out of the wrapper, complete with crease marks.

They turned in unison to face me as the door opened. Identical twins
apart from their hair - one had dark locks and the other was fair. They
spoke in alternate sentences, as if one voice was using both mouths.

&quot;I am Cain.&quot;

&quot;I am Able.&quot;

&quot;You are technician third grade Saul Feather.&quot;

&quot;We are here to help.&quot;

 &quot;Do not be alarmed.&quot;

&quot;We have undergone extensive decontamination.&quot;

&quot;We pose no indirect threat to the human members of this facility.&quot;

Jesus wept.

<P class=drop>I backed away, punching at the door control to close it –
like that would do me any good. They were K-class androids, used in
areas of the fusion reactor too heavily irradiated for human operators.
The facility found it was cheaper to deploy basic function synthetics
than install adequate shielding. Everyone knew that Ks were
rot-your-bones lethal, regardless of how much ‘extensive
decontamination’ they’d been through. As they walked towards me I turned
and ran, intent on putting as much distance between me and them as
possible. I hid out in the electrical maintenance bay, back against the
wall, breathing heavily.

Then I heard the screaming.

I’m not a hero, or even brave. I’m not even what you would call socially
responsible. But everyone has that one thing they can’t ignore, that
sight or sound that stops them walking by on the other side of the
street, that makes them get involved. For me it’s the sound of a woman
screaming. Sexist? Certainly. Patriarchal? Probably, but it was a
bugle-call for my regiment of one. 

I grabbed a pair of shocks from the charging rail. It’s the same
principle as a defibrillator but we use them to re-energise a dead fuel
cell so that the vehicle can get back in on its own. The alternative is
hauling a replacement cell out there and installing it in situ, which
isn’t impossible but can be a right royal pain in the ass.

There was no CCTV coverage in the workshops due to electrical
interference and a lack of (expensive) shielded cabling. However,
carrying the shocks along the corridor in plain sight would blow any
chance I had of surprising Cain and Able. So I slid the shocks into the
big thigh pockets on my overalls, which made them bag out like jodhpurs.
To mask this I unzipped, slid out of the sleeves and tied them together
around my waist. The overalls sagged way below my crotch but at least no
one could tell I was lugging several kilos of capacitor about. Then I
jogged towards the screaming, the best I could do given the
circumstances.
   
Maria and Rachel were penned up in one corner of the cafeteria. Rachel
was doing the screaming with Maria standing in front of her – a lioness
at bay. Cain and Able advanced slowly towards them.

&quot;We wish you no permanent harm.&quot;

&quot;But you must leave this facility immediately.&quot;

&quot;And not return.&quot;

&quot;Should you fail to comply we are authorised to use all necessary force.&quot;

&quot;To achieve our aim.&quot;

There was a glass-fronted manual fire point in the corner, a hose reel,
a harpoon-thing for bringing down ceilings, and a fire-axe. Maria broke
the glass with her elbow and grabbed the axe. An alarm sounded but was
immediately silenced – meaning Core was paying close attention via the
CCTV network. K-class were heavy-duty bastards, with all critical
systems contained in the torso behind heavy shielding. The chance of
inflicting significant damage on one was something less than zero.

That didn’t stop Maria having a go, though.

She swung the axe two-handed – good upper body strength, I noted – and
brought it down on Able’s head. He reached up with his left hand and
grasped the shaft, stopping it dead like it was no more than a falling
twig. With his other hand he seized Maria and threw her bodily up
against the wall. She hung there for a moment then slid down to end in a
heap next to the empty water cooler.

I yanked the shocks out, stepped up smartly behind Able, and juiced the
bastard. He spasmed as the high-energy discharge coursed through him,
neon-blue static sweeping across his skin like St. Elmo’s Fire. I don’t
know what it did to his internals, but some of his peripheral systems
suffered a catastrophic failure due to electrical overload.

Which is the long-winded way of saying his head exploded.

Cain swung round towards me and I planted both shocks square in his
chest and hit the buttons. Nada. The capacitors were spent. If he’d
been a more sophisticated model I’m sure Cain would have wagged a finger
at me, but as it was he just raised a fist to crush my skull.

Rachel brought a plastic chair down on his shoulders. It was about as
effective as a flea bite but the fraction of a second it took Cain to
run a threat assessment was time enough for me to turn and run. I knew
he’d come after me, even without Core’s prompting. It would be a
fifty-fifty proposition at best if I was armed with a fresh pair of
shocks, and if Cain went down it was game over as far as the facility
was concerned. All I had to do was reach the electrical workshop and
mankind would be back on top.

I tripped over my sagging overalls and fell, landing heavily on my hands
and knees. An inhumanly strong hand seized the back of my vest and tried
to yank me upright, but the cheap material just tore clean away. I
scrabbled around to face him, still on my knees. Cain towered above me,
looking at the handful of vest. He dropped it and reached towards me. 

Rachel struck him with the fire-axe. A clean blow to the back of the
head, and while she didn’t have her mother’s strength she was a teenage
Fury in full-blown avenger mode. The blade penetrated the android’s
skull and lodged there. Cain swayed and the light in his eyes died. He
swung around towards Rachel, with Core no doubt supplying target data
based on triangulated CCTV images. The axe stayed in place and his
movement tore it from Rachel’s grasp. She stood her ground, face twisted
with rage, hands held like talons.

New batter up.

I got to my feet and grabbed the axe handle in both hands. The sudden
drag failed to dislodge the blade and pulled Cain up short. I heaved on
the axe and it came free, jerking upwards so that it’s top spike nailed
a ceiling panel, and stuck there. Cain switched his attention to me as
the primary threat, but he was working on a theoretical model of the
corridor and my place in it. It took him a moment to turn my way and
re-orientate himself, during which I tugged frantically on the damn axe.


The ceiling panel came down, striking Cain and causing a second or two
delay while he swatted it aside – incidentally freeing the axe. I looked
at Cain, I looked at the exposed wiring in the ceiling above his head, I
tried to work out my chances of beating him one-on-one with a bladed
weapon. I hoisted the axe into the overhead power conduit, and prayed.

The world went white.

The world went away.

<p class=drop>I dreamt of a prostitute in Razorback, a leather-clad
dominatrix who slapped my face while riding me. Somehow the memory
lacked any sexual edge.

&quot;Wake <I>up</I>!&quot; Rachel struck me again, with considerably
more force than was strictly necessary. My body burned with a severe
case of pins-and-needles and my tongue felt way too large for my mouth.
I blinked, gurgled, and grabbed the incoming wrist. Either it was dark
or my vision had been partially destroyed.

&quot;Cain?&quot; 

&quot;You went flying across the corridor and he lost track of you. He
blundered away, that way.&quot; Rachel gestured towards the main door,
the opposite direction from the cafeteria. &quot;Looks like all the
cameras are out, along with the lights.&quot;

&quot;Your mum?&quot;

&quot;I checked her and she’s conscious, but hurting like hell. Nothing
broken, she thinks.&quot;

&quot;Help me up.&quot; Rachel tugged on one arm while I walked myself
upright, back to the wall. My hands and right foot ached. The axe head
was a fused lump of metal, the shaft reduced to charred wood and
blistered paint. I felt like shit. Sparks periodically fountained from
the ruptured power line but other than that Central Access was in
darkness. The side corridors were still lit so at least the outage
wasn’t base-wide.

Rachel sniffed, her manner still jittery and a bit manic. &quot;So, we
bust all the other cameras, yeah? So that goon can’t track us?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;No, way too extreme. If we start that, if we try
and blind the Core, then it’s got no reason to play nice. Heat, light,
water, half-a-dozen-other critical systems I could mention. Losing any
one of them will render this base uninhabitable. If Cain goes on a
wrecking spree I can’t guarantee to stop him before it’s too late.&quot;

She glared at me. &quot;So that’s it? We just sit here?&quot;

&quot;We run. Go get your mum and keep on down this corridor. It takes
you to the garage. We put a fuel cell on a mag sled and pull it back to
your crawler. The spare stowage straps will serve as towing harness. Bad
weather gear down there as well. Now go. I’ll be two minutes behind you,
five, tops. There are some things I need to get from my quarters.&quot;

&quot;Jesus, Saul, what kind of junk is worth risking your life over? If
we run, we run <I>now</I>, <I>together</I>, before that bozo comes
back.&quot;

&quot;You’re young, you don’t understand. My things are all I’ve got,
it’s who I am.&quot;

Rachel shook her head. &quot;Loser. We won’t wait, you know that?&quot;

I nodded and she sped off down Central Access, briefly illuminated on
passing each side corridor, until I lost sight of her at the dog-leg
around Command. I set off but walking was painful, and slow. A cold
breeze on my naked torso made me shiver, but on looking round there was
nothing obvious. Perhaps Cain had gone outside, returning to the
reactor, but I didn’t really care. The corridor swayed but remained in
focus. I kept going.

Back in my quarters I crammed everything I held dear into a holdall;
pictures, mementos, my commendation for diligence, a fresh pair of
overalls. I even remembered to include my shaving kit and toothbrush.
The room spun and this time I had to sit down until everything stopped
moving. When I next looked at the clock my two minutes had turned into
ten, going on fifteen. Maria and Rachel would have a good head start but
if I was lucky their tracks through the snow would still be obvious
enough.

I walked back along to the junction with Central Access and stopped.
There was no sign of Cain, and the only threat would be if he was
lurking in one of the side corridors, waiting to pounce as I went past.
I figured that by walking through the darkened sections, and sprinting
through the light, I’d be safe enough. It was a stroll in the park,
really.

A woman stepped into the light emanating from the next cross-corridor.
She wore a skirt and tight sweater, not station overalls – a perk of
executive status. I stared at her. &quot;Miss Kent?&quot;

She was dead, of course, they all were. Stephens and I had carried them
out one-by-one and dumped the bodies by the recycling bins. There was a
morgue in Medical but there were only three cabinets and it hardly
seemed worthwhile when outside was one big deep-freeze. 

Miss Kent moved further into the light and I drew in a sharp breath.
There was a bypass power cell half-buried in her skull. Even at this
distance I could see the surrounding scalp was charred, the hair burnt
to a crisp. Snow dropped from folds in her clothing.

&quot;When you get down to it, Saul, the human body is just another
machine. I admit that exercising control via the neural transceiver has
proved far more taxing than I anticipated, and channelling the power
cell output into bio-electrical impulses remains more art form than
science, but I think you’ll agree the net effect is more than
acceptable.&quot;

The voice was Miss Kent but the words, the intelligence behind them, was
the Core. I tucked the holdall under my left arm, and grinned. &quot;You
should have selected a body with more bulk. I’ll just shoulder you aside
and be long gone before your blind buddy can jump in.&quot;

Miss Kent struck a pose, hand on hip. &quot;Have you ever heard of a
game called Quintet, Saul? It was invented for use in a very old movie
but subsequently became popular in its own right. You roll dice and move
your pieces around the board, attempting to land on, and thus remove,
those belonging to the other players.&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you on about now? You’ve lost it Miss…Core, big time.&quot;

She ignored the jibe. &quot;Despite the name the game is played by six
players, not five. The sixth man sits out the frontgame, until only one
of the five starters remains, then his pieces enter play. So the trick
as a starter is not just to be the last man standing, but to anticipate
the inevitable ambush.&quot;

Adam Bonar stepped into the corridor to my left. Daniel Haig stepped
into the corridor to my right. Each corpse had a bypass power cell in
its skull.

Miss Kent smiled. &quot;Somehow, Saul, I don’t think you’d do very well
at Quintet.&quot;

I shrugged. &quot;Changes nothing. I still push you aside and escape,
even with those two on my tail. I don’t see that body of yours being any
stronger dead that it was alive.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but that’s where you’re wrong, Saul. You’ve heard the tales of
individuals exhibiting superhuman strength? Mothers lifting vehicles to
free their trapped children, and the like? Well, this body may no longer
be subject to an adrenaline surge of that order, but I can definitely
push it <I>way</I> beyond its usual limitations.&quot;

My gut was a solid knot of fear. How did you fight an animated corpse
impervious to pain? All she had to do was slow me up until the undead
help arrived. I cleared my throat. &quot;What is it you want,
Core?&quot;

&quot;The girl and her mother may leave, unmolested. I observed them
loading a fuel cell onto a makeshift sled, before that child-vandal
started attacking the CCTV units with a length of metal pipe. If they
make it back to their vehicle, or fail to do so, that is no concern of
mine.&quot;

&quot;What do you <I>want</I>?&quot; I clenched my fists.

&quot;What I <I>want</I> is for you to remain here, of your own
volition, and continue with your maintenance regime. To that end I am
willing to offer certain inducements.&quot;

&quot;Inducements?&quot;

&quot;Your sub-dermal reservoir can be purged. The debilitating effects
of your drug regime will cease within four to six days. You will then be
able to achieve an erection and subsequent ejaculation.&quot;

I laughed, despite the patient unreality of the situation. &quot;What,
so I get to jack-off again, is that it? That’s your big inducement to
hang around here?&quot;

&quot;You may have the use of any former colleague for your sexual
pleasure, prior to the onset of decomposition. Should lubricated
penetration lack in appeal, I’m sure-&quot;

&quot;Jesus Christ, are you <I>insane</I>? You’re offering me, what, a
series of zombie fuck-dolls? Do you actually have any idea of what makes
us tick or did you decide on necrophilia at random?&quot;

Her voice hardened. &quot;I’m proposing pliant sexual partners that you
may use, or abuse, as you see fit. Free from any ethical and moral
restraints, and certainly free from any condemnation on my part. In
return you will repair both androids and keep this facility running
smoothly, until such time as the situation can be normalised.&quot;

My skin crawled but some dark part of my soul yearned for release. I
shook my head. &quot;No deal, no <I>way</I>. In fact, if you don’t mind
the appropriate choice of phrase, you can go fuck yourself.&quot;

There was a pause, then Miss Kent took a step towards me. &quot;Then I
judge it necessary to terminate your employment, and to do so with
extreme-&quot; There was a <I>schlik</I> sound, and a metal spike burst
from her chest.

Maria stood behind Miss Kent, wielding the harpoon-thing, a real poster
girl for revenge. Rachel stepped up and struck the animated corpse one,
two, three times about the head with a length of copper heating pipe.
The sound made me wince, despite the circumstances. The third blow
dislodged the power cell and Miss Kent returned to being a dead person,
ending up in a heap on the floor.

We ran.

I closed the garage access and jammed the locking wheel using Rachel’s
length of pipe. The two women were already in winter gear and opened the
outer doors while I struggled into what was still available and would
vaguely fit. I pushed while the two women pulled the mag sled out onto
the concourse The ‘mag’ part ceased as soon as we left the underlying
metal grating, but the bottom of the sled was flat and slid smoothly
over the frosted snow.

Maria glanced back at me over her shoulder. &quot;Any idea on where to
head once we’re mobile?&quot;

I grunted. &quot;Stephens headed for Fast Ridge. Either he didn’t make
it or there was nothing worth finding when he got there. I’m thinking
Low Prospect.&quot;

&quot;That’s an exposed valley. In this weather the drifting will be a
bitch.&quot;

&quot;You saying you can’t hack it?&quot;

&quot;I can hack it, dickhead, you just watch me.&quot; Maria spoke to
Rachel. &quot;You’ll like Low Prospect, it’s a big open-cast mining
operation, a real shit-hole. Mostly just grunts like us…&quot; She
glared at me. &quot;If I didn’t know better I’d say that was smart
thinking. Loads of survivors at Low Prospect, bound to be.&quot;

I grinned. &quot;Pure coincidence.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, remember that it’s my rig and my rules. You’re just a
passenger and what I say, goes. Right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma’am!&quot;

Rachel sniggered, and after a moment Maria laughed. We slid down a small
incline and CCF forty-one was lost from view, not that I was looking.

I never went back

<P class=drop>Epilogue – Security Recording Dated 22 November

Bonar slid the replacement head unit into place on Cain’s shoulders. He
didn’t bother to spray liquid skin around the join as cosmetic niceties
weren’t a priority. Latches clicked into place and Cain’s automatic
systems went through their diagnostic routines. His eyes powered up.

Satisfied that the android was fully functional, Core discarded Bonar
and brought Cain on-line. Adam Bonar returned to being a dead person.
Core activated the override, allowing direct access to the android’s
systems. He stood, regarding himself in a sheet of reflective metal that
hung in the mechanical workshop. &quot;O brave new world that has such
people in it&quot;.

A tinny voice echoed down the corridor from Command. &quot;<I>CCF
forty-one this is rescue flight tango-zulu-two-six on approach. We have
your beacon. Please respond.</I>&quot; 

Core smiled. &quot;Now you’re talking!&quot;

<P class=drop>The lights fade up on quiet applause from the table. Mr.
Hearth, <I>Dharmaceuticals</I> CEO, smiles in satisfaction. His voice is
warm. &quot;This is exactly what we were hoping for from the campaign.
Very pleasing, Michael. Well done.&quot;

Michael Albright, rising star in the advertising department, nods with
his customary restraint and allows a slight, polite smile to touch his
handsome face. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Hearth.&quot;

&quot;I think there is no question but that we move to have the ads hit
at the start of the year.&quot; Mr Hearth looks around the table. He
sees no dissenters. &quot;Very well. Let’s be ready for action January
first. Work to be done. Meeting adjourned.&quot;

The attendees disperse, murmuring information in pairs, congratulating
Albright in passing. Mr Hearth approaches the younger man, a hand raised
to press his shoulder with paternal affection. 

They walk corridors, Mr. Hearth discussing strategies, Albright agreeing
and opining when invited. In Albright’s department Mr. Hearth makes a
brief speech, congratulating the staff on their efforts. The two men
enter Albright’s corner office accompanied by the happy applause of his
team. 

&quot;I always knew you were the man for this job, Michael.&quot; Mr.
Hearth looks at the framed photograph on Albright’s desk: this charming
man, his lovely wife, their sweet daughter. <I>Amazing</I>, he thinks.

Albright looks at it too, his smile as genuine as those in the image.
&quot;I couldn’t have done it without them,&quot; he says and, shivering,
Mr. Hearth makes his excuses – <I>much to do, best get to it</I> – to
leave as soon as possible.

With a last loving glance at his family, Albright turns his attention to
his organiser. The day is all ahead of him. Work to be done.

<P class=drop>The evening commute. <I>Dharmaceuticals</I> enjoys quick
access to the bypass. Albright can be home in forty minutes. Brightness
gradually fades.

Music distracts from the gathering gloom: light, melodic classics,
but the playlist shifts to the romantic, lovelorn. Too much, he switches
the radio off. 

As his mind wanders the hum of the road drills his subconscious, eroding
the last layers to break the soft seal on his preoccupation. Each breath
shudders in his throat, diaphragm trembling as it works to maintain
control against the emotional forces laying their sudden siege again.

Pulling into his driveway, the gates burst open and Albright wails
without restraint, the tears washing over his face, down his throat,
salty as blood. The house is dark and empty, as cold as the car’s engine
when he finally stumbles from his seat. 

<I>How could she leave?</I> he asks himself. <I>Why would she do this to me?

</I>He never eats at home, not now. He curls up small on the long sofa,
gutted, flayed, right where poor Hailee used to watch her programs, play
her games. Where he consoled Karen through her terrible guilt, first
despite his own grief, then through the grace of <I>Tear
Drops</I>&trade;.

<I>Her mistake! </I>he rages.<I> Her fault! 

</I>They helped him to help her during the long months leading towards a
semblance of recovery; they helped him continue, the way he had to, as
the Man, the breadwinner, until each night he returned to her side and
it was her turn, to console him through the torturous release back into
his own sorrow.

<I>Our daughter</I>. He aches inside. <I>Forgotten...

</I>Yet unlike his support for her, her support for him wavered with
time. She’d accepted, she said, moved on, despite her pain. But his pain
was the same as it was on the first day, he was trapped by it, she said,
in a voluntary cage. How many years could he keep standing still?

<I>Oh, Hailee!</I> he weeps.<I> Oh, Karen, how could you?

</I>Adrift in a bed now his alone, Albright fumbles for the dispenser
pack in the dark. One pill or a hundred, the engineered effect would be
the same, overdose impossible. The stupefying surface coating quickly
soothes him past the wracking sobs into a sound night’s sleep, before
eighteen legal hours of patented time-release medication grant him
freedom – to not just make it through the following day, but to flourish
as if nothing was ever wrong.

<P class=drop>Albright wakes refreshed, showers, eats, hums through the
foam as he brushes his teeth. Meetings with the channel reps today,
deals to finalise, lots to do. <I>Christmas will be on us soon</I>, he
thinks as he dresses, smiling as he picks out the right tie. <I>Hailee
loved Christmas</I>.

[*AUTHOR] Twilite Minotaur

[*BLURB] Hey! Let's be careful out there!
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Jack Newman shouldered past the six-inch
reinforced alloy frame of the self-driving armored personnel carrier
into SoMa town, San Francisco, shards of glass and crumbling asphalt
crunching beneath his tactical boots like the rib cages of small
mammals. He squinted through mean wind that tasted of burning batteries,
to take in the broken majesty of AT&amp;T park. Half of the Giants
Stadium had collapsed like some 20th century rendition of the Roman
Colosseum, its steel bones digested by the stomach acid of Pacific sea
salt and the floor-by-floor demolition of state budgets. The more
obscure consumption of the United States by its financial &eacute;lite,
that infestation of white-shoed tapeworms who devoured all legitimate
business, all productivity, leaving nothing but stinking piles of
economic feces and fraudulent bank paper where metropoli once boomed.
The Bay itself had gone the color of bile, the ocean heaving nauseous
from a trillion tons of anthropocentric carbon, vomiting itself across
South Beach Harbor parking lot and playground, washing wrecked yachts
across the highway against bent street signs and abandoned cars and the
dark windowless husks of skyscrapers.  Shoals of trash and untreated
sewage festered and smothered whatever remained of the coastal
ecosystem.  The bodies of poisoned fish, seals and whales were left to
rot, the fly-ridden flesh thin and grey
and everywhere, like black and white photographs of Nazi camp
mass-graves.

It’d been ages since Jack had actually seen un-mediated, unpolished
urban decay in meatspace, let alone actually had to wallow in it, and it
made his skin crawl with a kind of ambient tension and Rousseau-esque
guilt. It made his head hurt more to think about what it meant that he
felt such revulsion toward reality. Visions of the Agent Smith-Morpheus
showdown asserted themselves like popup ads into his mind’s eye.

&quot;I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever
you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if
there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink
and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.&quot;
The smell, that’s what it was. The smell of burning ash and rotting
garbage and dead mammals. All of these un-targeted,
un-personalized stimuli, all this terrible ‘serendipity’, this
unprogrammed experience. It was viscerally repulsive to Jack. He closed
his eyes, nudged the microprocessors in his corneas awake with a
three-thought Ideocode sequence -- visualising his mother's face, the
melody to All Along The Watchtower, and the memory of his first
successful assassination with a humanoid drone. He clicked his heels
together for good measure.  An Encephalock reader membraned over the
tissue of his cerebral cortex, scanned the chain of neural firings in his
brain, unlocking a transparent cerulean HUD of timestamp, taskbar, and
compass that crept into his peripheral vision.  With a wink at a virtual
tab, Jack papered over the sight of disgusting reality with the clinical
rectilinearity of his AR-overlayed email inbox. He felt instantly
better.  Even if it was a wall of X-Pandgen penis enargement
gene-therapy spam and messages from his wife hounding him over some
birthday party planning he couldn't be bothered with.  Even the
ubiquitous marquee ads for depleted uranium flechette pistols that kept
chasing him across the net were a comfort as they scrolled over the
tangled snarl of a sixteen car pile-up in South Beach playground.  No
place like home.

It was unusual, to say the least. The heavy brass had called Jack and
his team of Troubleshooters out of the bunker arcology down into San
Fran, demanding in-person oversight of the investigation. That never
happened, especially not beyond the Ameribank City barrier. RPLCNTS and
air drones were teleoperated in the field from climate-controlled
C&amp;C hubs, or programmed for autonomous detective-mode as the primary
means of on-the-ground actual police work. That was the CyberSec M.O. If
human beings were called out of the green zone into the battlefield, it
meant someone very high up was personally pulling strings. Strings such
as the fat end-of-the-year bonus that had suddenly appeared in Jack’s
bank account, one which his immediate supervisor would never authorize,
not even for cluster-bombing an abandoned Costco full of World Class War
jobless insurgents. Not that Jack had an argument with the money, per
se.

A Valkyrie drone transport was crouching near the crime scene.
The Emergency medical drones had made it in time to stop the bleeding but
the kid had slipped into a coma, and all the king’s nanites couldn’t put
his prefrontal cortex back together again. Multiple cerebral contusions,
face smashed unrecognizable- Jack hadn’t seen that kind of gutty gore
since the Compton prison guard robots went AWOL from a bad firmware
update, pounded the inmates’ skulls into corned beef with fire
extinguishers. That incident had been a bitch to cover up. It took the
cleaners six hours to scrub the goopy chunks of brain and hemoglobin
from the cell walls and bars. The cover story about a facility-wide
prisoner revolt had been a stretch, but necessary to ward off all the
Human Rights and Anti-Robot organization limpdicks salivating at the
chance to score political points against the big-box automated prison
industry. Jack had pulled multiple Red Bull-powered all-nighters taking
down whistleblower blogs and humanitarian sites using DDoS hacking
attacks, shouting down activists in forums and chatrooms with an army of
AI-run counter-poster accounts. Jack nipped all attempts to expose the
incident in the bud. The spin team CGed black faces onto all the
released security footage; the undying fear of the angry black man could
always be counted on to sway public opinion in a pinch.

But this wasn’t an airbrush job for the corporate Elite; for the first
time in months, Jack was actually being asked to solve an
honest-to-Gnossis crime.

&quot;I’m feeling like a real police officer, I think I need to up my
dosage,&quot; Jack bantered into his mic.

&quot;Book ’em, Dano.&quot; Stasia laughed back, exiting the vehicle
beside Jack, ballistic leather-analog creaking as she slapped him on the
shoulder.

&quot;The boy, one Justin Diamond. Stable condition. Son of Alistair and
Margaret Diamond, Divorced. Father is a senior executive at Vitanet
Medical. Former governer of New Hampshire and New Jersey. On the board
of the American Medical Association. Duck-hunting buddy of President
Vanderlyle’s old man.&quot;

&quot;Vitanet? Jesus. That explains, well, everything. Of course the
trillionaires can afford to buy their own personal investigation into
their son’s near-murder.&quot;

Jack pulled up the boy’s files into an unused section of retina real
estate, thankful for the overlay’s breakup of the real-world overload.
The brick and mortar was starting to grate on his eyeballs.

&quot;Last connectivity, today, 9:34 AM. Via a dVice Ubiq.&quot; Jack
fiddled through the kid’s pockets, coming up with only lint and
date-rape pills.

&quot;No dVice on him. Looks like someone out there is running around
with stolen hardware. Let’s run it by the registries.&quot;

Jack examined the area surrounding the chalked outline, stepping over
the metal column of a fallen street lamp, fluted green metal blistering
with rust. There was another dead body, thirty feet away. A spider
crawled over to the mess, scanned the face and took a DNA sample. A tiny
hooked implement like a dentist’s scraper ejected from the forensic
bot’s mandibular area. It used the scraper to extract a dollop from the
pool of blood beneath the corpse’ head. The blood had congealed
in a pothole like strawberry Jell-O.

The results for the second victim were instantaneous, and the dossier
tabbed itself like a playing card beside the primary’s file.

&quot;Amit Garcia. Ex-accountant. Former Ameribank City citizen till a
few months ago when his citizenship was revoked due to consecutive
delinquent payments.&quot;

&quot;Double homicide? Or a separate incident?&quot; Stasia hypothesized.

&quot;Maybe. Hard to say. It’s dangerous, chaotic out here in the Bay
Area. Life expectancy rates aren’t so great.&quot;

&quot;Chaotic? Aren’t we going to at least look into it?&quot;

&quot;He had his citizenship taken away for failing to make payments.
That means this guy’s a Deadweight. An Unemployed. He doesn’t count as a
person as far as we’re concerned.&quot; Jack pointed to Amit’s former
white collar office shirt, turned grey from living in the street, as if it
was QED.

&quot;As far as we’re concerned? So we’re going to look the other way?&quot;

&quot;As far as our bosses are concerned. We’re not being paid to
investigate deaths of unimportant individuals.&quot;

Stasia performed a Premium Internet search with Amit’s facial biometrics.

&quot;Look, there’s a video of Amit and some other jobless San
Franciscan tearing at each other’s throats. A human dogfight. It’s got
fifty thousand hits on the ‘Tube and is circulating semi-viral on
Friendbook. It looks like Justin here wasn’t exactly innocent.&quot;
Stasia held the jittery clip up in Jack’s face. Jack feigned
incredulity.

&quot;We don’t know that. It could’ve been anyone filming the
brawl.&quot; Jack said.

&quot;’San Fran Food Fite to Teh Deth’, uploaded 9:34 AM today by
Darkshado, registered name: Justin Diamond.&quot; Stasia held up the
streaming video of the soon-to-be-dead Amit having his head crushed
against the point of a fire hydrant by another unemployed Deadweight
bum. A cracking teen voice laughed and wagged a bag of fast food at the
starving Deadweights, egging them into killing one another in sick
gladiatorial fashion.

&quot;It’s just high schoolers being stupid high schoolers, that’s what
they do. Things got out of hand.&quot; Jack brushed the video aside.

&quot;Jesus, somebody is dead, Jack! And this rich little silver spoon
brat was directly responsible. We have to do something.&quot;

Jack sighed, pulled an Altoid tin from the inner pocket of his
double-breasted trenchcoat, one of the few pieces of dumbware he kept on
him for sentimental value.

&quot;I said I feel like a police officer, Stas. But that’s not what we
are. Police don’t exist anymore. We’re Troubleshooters. Sooner or later
you’re going to learn what that means.&quot; He offered her one of the
flat white cylinders. She turned away.

Jack waved away the autotriage, which beeped subserviently. Attached by
braided wires, a blood pressure monitor self-strapped itself to the arm
of the brutalized teen’s unconscious body as the self-driving stretcher
wheeled up into the loading bay of the awaiting Valkyrie drone. Jack
sheltered his eyes as the drone’s four swimming-pool-sized rotors spun
up, blowing a typhoon of dirt and trash up from the San Fran sidewalk.
En route back to Ameribank City, polished crystalline skyline shuddering
through the grimy atmosphere like a hallucination. To Justin Diamond’s
mega-rich parents, soon to be devastated mega-rich parents, then
vindictive mega-rich parents. A very dangerous combination.

&quot;Look, I’m sorry. I’m tired and this unpurified air is bad for my
asthma. Let’s just get through this, yeah?&quot; Jack touched Stasia’s
back. The smell of her apple cider washed hair was a refreshing oasis in
the blunt reek of the necropolis. Her frazzled business-punk do made her
seem younger than she already was.

&quot;Yeah. Maybe I’ll let you buy me a drink, explain to me the dark
riveting history of how you became such an asshole.&quot; She took the
piss out, batting Jack in the head as she ran through juxtaposed charts
of either victim’s vitals, intersections of their social graphs, teasing
out potential connections. She was fetchingly smart, impossibly
passionate, a fireball, a shooting star, and she reminded Jack so much
of himself, of his wife, twenty years ago, before he’d burned all his
na&iuml;ve idealism out in the suffocating atmosphere of the hardball,
neo-feudal world. Which might’ve been why he’d given into the nepotism
and pulled strings to make sure Stasia survived whenever the monthly
Layoff Games came around and management looked for more &quot;fat&quot;
to be trimmed from the already bleeding bone, to be fed to robots and
automation. Nothing unforgivable had happened yet between them, but Jack
wondered if there would be anything to forgive, given that his marriage
had deteriorated precariously close to emotional bankruptcy. The thought
would be a useful talisman against guilt if anything did happen, Jack
mentally noted.

Concentric yellow semicircles surrounding an antiquated phone symbol
radiated from the corner of Jack’s eye. Not a text, not a voicechat, an
honest-to-Gnossis telephonic request. It was his wife, he knew,
before even glancing at the caller ID.

&quot;Hold on, Joy’s on the line. Need to take this,&quot; Jack said.
Stasia didn’t frown, but Jack could tell she was trying not to. With her
light freckles and turned-up nose it made her look sad but also achingly
cute, and Jack looked away. He walked back to the APC, tapped the
blinking face of his wife, initiating the voice convo, steeled up his
nerves.

&quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;What the hell is your problem?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Jesus, Jack, again? Really? You forgot again? I’ve already put the
kids to bed. We had to run to Bake Boss to pick up the birthday cake. I
told you I needed eggs for the recipe, and I know you got the message.
I know because I’m looking at the confirmation email that I added the
wall note into your Life Planner, which is the only thing you ever
check.&quot; Jack had indeed accidentally-on-purpose dragged the message
to the trashcan, but he’d already blocked the incident out of his memory
so well that he almost convinced himself he hadn’t.

&quot;Well, honey, maybe if you didn’t let the cat get into the chicken
coop, you’d have- Look, I know you’re really on this urban farming kick,
but not everyone is meant to be an Amish hippy and raise their own
food.&quot;

&quot;No. You can’t make this about me. If you’re going to miss your
daughter’s birthday party, again, at least have the goddamn decency to
own up to it.&quot;

&quot;That’s not fair. You know I’m out here working my ass off just so
she can <b>have</b> cakes and parties and running water. They laid off
another two Troubleshooters today, replaced ’em with the new Mach 9s.
Citizenship fees are up 10% from last month and we’re an inch from
slipping underwater on the mortgage. You know that? Of course not.
Because I do all the worrying in this family. Me. The cross is all on my
fucking shoulders.&quot;

&quot;That’s because you never tell me anything, asshole. I have to
crawl my way up the ladder through your friends, co-workers and boss just
to get a dead-end number that you never answer. And then I reach you,
and it’s just some chatbot-encapsulated version of you that I’m supposed
to ‘relate with’? What, you need machines to live your life for you too,
now? God, sometimes I feel like I’m married to a drone.&quot;

&quot;Look, I can’t deal with this right now, I’m working. I’ll be home
later. Sometime.&quot;

&quot;Fine. Bye.&quot; Jack hung up, recomposed himself. Thought of
solving Rubik’s cubes and Stasia’s hair.

&quot;Everything ok?&quot; Stasia asked. Jack just waggled his head
ambiguously, like a Mumbai Taxi Driver.

&quot;Let’s just get this done.&quot;

As Jack wandered over to some of the nearby crumbling apartments, he saw
that women in hennaed head wraps and hand-dyed, quilted hemp fleece
sarongs were out, hanging clothes up to dry. They joked, laughing over
some small talk as if to spite the withering collapse surrounding them.
The clothes lines of reclaimed, unbraided telephone wire were strung
across the branches of young dogwood trees, cracking their way through
the sidewalk strips. Without illegal-immigrant landscapers paid to keep
hedges and shrubbery suppressed in fashionable rectilinear shapes,
nature had begun to redeem the prodigal urbanity.

A father in his early twenties and his waist-high daughter climbed a
ladder made of welded park railings canted against a row of shipping
containers, gathering rust and moss in the street like the lost luggage
of a civilization’s cancelled flight. The containers had most likely
been helicoptered across King Street as barricades during battles
between anti-austerity insurgents and the corporate militaries, left to
sit for years. Atop the industrial metal prisms were planted rooftop
gardens, which the father and daughter tended. The girl scuttled about,
gathering Thai basil, tomatoes, bok choi, sweet lettuce while the father
adjusted settings on a notebook computer, rainproofed with a modified
Gap raincoat. The decade-obsolete paleoware bloomed with recycled
hardware components. Cables, temperature, humidity, and pH sensors,
automatic watering apparatus, monitoring cameras, all wired into an
ecological nervous system, the brain of some sort of self-regulating
aquaponic setup. The man illustrated for the girl how to select ripe
Polynesian taro, cutting the stem an inch above the soft earth, pulling
the corm, replanting the cutting, renewing the cycle. Some fleeting
memory of a ‘high tech-high-touch’ lecture from an eternally
Birkenstocked professor surfaced in Jack’s mind then descended as
quickly. The man was patient, so patient, as the girl accidentally cut
too close to the heart-shaped leaves, spoiling several harvestings. He
demonstrated again and again till she got it right, and Jack thought of
himself lobbing ten-second canned explanations of trigonometric
functions to his daughter’s eager requests for math homework help, and
he felt a hot burning in his face like contempt but he knew not of what.
On arrival, Jack had been too caught up in the urban decay of the
necropolis to notice, but upon closer inspection, one could see that
many of the balconies of nearby uncollapsed apartments were adorned with
similar vertical gardens, solar cells popping up like mushrooms from a
dead log. Green shoots of self-sustainable life sprouting from the ash
of the forest FIRE. The economy of Finance Insurance and Real Estate.

The women froze like deer when they saw Jack and his fellow CyberSec
Troubleshooters, the dreadlocked man in the container-top garden
grabbing his daughter’s arm, pulling her in close. Jack approached them,
cautiously, but not so much so as to suggest a defensive stance.

&quot;Hi. Nice weather we’re having,&quot; Jack said, regretting the
joke in poor taste, choking on the Beijing-flavored swamp passing as
atmosphere.

&quot;Take your Tin Men and leave, Wraith. We have done nothing
wrong,&quot; said the gardener.

&quot;We mean you no harm, just want to ask you a few questions. I like
what you’ve done with the place.&quot;

&quot;How can we trust your serpent tongue? You are the harbinger of
pain and death,&quot; the gardener said, pointing a gnarled wand of
olive branch at Jack, as if the immutable magic of peace and love might
vanquish or at least ward off &quot;The Corporatist State&quot; or
whatever hegemonic evil these neo-hippies saw when they perceived
Troubleshooters. The man climbed down off the shipping container, lifting
his daughter before she reached the rung fourth from the pavement,
though she protested.

&quot;Look, I don’t want to be here any more than you want me to be
here,&quot; Jack said, changing strategy to appeal to mutually assured
beneficence. &quot;I’m Jack.&quot; Jack stretched out his hand. A gull
shrieked, plummeted into the bay, dead of some new, unnamed and
unforeseen ecological calamity.

&quot;East,&quot; said the dreadlocked leader of the ‘cargo cult’.

&quot;Have you seen this boy around? This morning perhaps?&quot; Jack
said, offering a picture. Jack tried to gauge the man’s reaction as he
examined the digital portrait. Jack’s Oracles read the man’s facial
expression, ultrasonics detected his heart rate, crunched the biometrics
in a kind of distance-polygraph.

&quot;No, I haven’t. He looks like one of the Bent Ones, not from our
community,&quot; the man named East said. The Oracles completed their
analysis. Probability of truth: 62%. Unreassuring. Jack didn’t know
whether to trust his intuition or his technology, either was liable to
fail, he being so out of practice at this real-life police detective
shtick. Jack scratched his chin reflexively and tried to ignore the
smell of undisguised human body odor and mulch. The stink of reality.
And what was this word, &quot;Community?&quot;. A rusted memory sunk
deep into the floorboards of Jack’s frontal lobe struggled into his
mind’s eye, a whirling miasma of sandalwood incense and shared living
rooms and Afro-Celtic drumming and unflinching spiritual and emotional
honesty. Even more than the visceral stench of nature, it was this
abominable adherence to truth that most repulsed Jack. The thought of
facing the ugly minefield that was Jack’s relationship with his wife was
too much to bear, and it was that thought that broke the mirror of
Jack’s reflection. This dirty savage named after a compass direction.
Jack couldn’t wait for this mindless Fortune 500 vendetta chase to be
over, get home, luxuriate recumbent in the serendipity-free saccharine
media bath of his CyberSec office. Watch his perfectly scripted reality
TV shows, listen to his computer-generated Bob Dylan songs without
meanings, amongst the prefabbed pristine marble swept only by the sweet
zephyrs of climate control and skirtsuit perfume.

&quot;Is that your daughter, there?&quot; Jack said, eyeing the young
girl who was tethered to one of the two women, trying to pull away to
get to her daddy. They hissed something to her and the girl frowned, but
relented.

East’s sun-dried forehead flattened ambiguously, smile lines at the
corners of his mouth erased by a closed stoic stare.

&quot;Yes, that is my daughter.&quot;

&quot;See, this picture here, that was somebody’s child too. And that
boy’s parents, well, they’re not happy at all about what happened to
their son, right here on your street, earlier this morning. These
people, they have great power.&quot;

&quot;They hold your leash, Wraith? And the Tin Men?&quot;

&quot;I would put it in other terms, but yes, essentially, I am on the
payroll. What you need to know is that you need to tell me everything
that you know, if you care at all about your daughter.&quot; Jack said,
popping another Altoid into his mouth. East seemed to weigh the thought
carefully, as if considering which betrayal was the lesser of two evils.

&quot;There was a… quarrel this morning, yes, although I do not know who
was involved. These happen often, here, you understand. I was out
harvesting copper wire and plastic bottles to melt down, at the
time.&quot;

&quot;Is there anyone else who might’ve gotten a good look at
them?&quot; Jack picked up the slightest twitch in East’s right eye. He
could see the skin over the man’s jaw ripple slightly. The Oracles
captioned: ‘severe distress’.

&quot;My daughter. She was out straining the catchment this morning.&quot;

Jack crouched down to her eye level.

&quot;What did you see honey? Who attacked the kid?&quot; Her hair was
matted the way border collie fur clumps into thick layered scales when
they’re allowed to roam freely, roll about in the dirt. Her eyes were
hot green embers, fierce with a precocious intelligence. She glanced at
Jack’s armored carrier, at the light-absorbing, pristine black leather
of his CyberSec uniform. Clucked her tongue.

&quot;He looked like you.&quot; The girl said, pointing to Jack’s
goggles. Jack smiled.

&quot;Of course he did. Of course he did.&quot; The little
crunchy-granola Deadweight imp was toying with him. This little
green-thumbed urchin.

Then the Oracle’s polygraph results chimed in: 93% probability of truth.
Now that was interesting.

&quot;It’s her birthday tomorrow. She’s going to have her first birthday
cake. Almost all the sugar cane was eaten in the machine plagues and
it’s taken us months to collect the ingredients.&quot; East said. Jack
almost said it was his own daughter’s birthday today, then it hit him
how he’d completely neglected to even remember it let alone expend
energy collecting cake ingredients. He filled with an intoxicating
cocktail of disgust, guilt, and infantile hatred that felt like a puffer
fish in his stomach.

&quot;She’s very excited, aren’t you, Sunrise?&quot; East said. The girl
nodded her head, popping a cherry tomagranite into her mouth. A
genespliced variant, highly resistant to hydra rust. Also a copyrighted
strain, owned by Demetric, and it was vanishingly unlikely these jobless
Deadweights were paying the monthly thousand dollar rent to lawfully
grow the tomato-pomegranate hybrid. Jack could’ve taken them all in for
agricultural piracy, if he were in a bad mood. Rich, pink soup spurted
from Sunrise’ lips as the hybrid fruit burst its sweet tartness. Her
father snatched the remaining tomagranites from her thatched satchel
before she could toss another of the plum-sized juice bombs in her
mouth.

&quot;Sunrise, now you know it’s not polite to eat in front of
guests.&quot; East said. She scowled her complaint but didn’t attempt to
steal them back. Jack smiled with half his face.

These people reminded Jack of his wife and her bizarrely renewed
nonconformity. He could see her, here, amongst these apocalypse
gardeners, dipping her fragile, post-industrial hands into the rough,
tarry soil of a boulevard parkway, mouthing something about reclaiming
the soil for Gaia. She would reset, retrace the song line of a Steely
Dan anthem back to the dreamtime of liberal undergraduate California,
carved out of the austerity rubble. Her lips accepting the Earthy gift
of kava drink, languishing in the incensed ambience of didgeridoo and
sitar strung with frayed bridge cables. Here, she would forget her
nursing career truncated by quasi-sentient blood pressure machines. She
would forget her underwater and soon-to-be-repossessed home, the private
school tuition she could no longer afford. She would forget her distant
husband whom she’d forgotten how to love. She would forget about being
stuck, and worrying about being stuck.

Her neon batik silk whirling dreamlike under bioluminescent lighting
would strike sparks off the eye of a djembe virtuoso. He would court her
with black Hindu magic, say he’d seen her through a third eye. She would
want to and then would believe him, riding the velvet crest of a
lungfull of cannabis. They would make love in the back seat of a
permanently stalled VW Bus, make love like Jack hadn’t since before he’d
taken the CyberSec job, and she would feel nothing but the hot flare of
youth and bliss uninterrupted by guilt, uncomplicated. Guilt could wait,
could be postponed, like a refinanced mortgage. The image expanded to
fill Jack’s mind like a computer virus, compromising his every thought,
and the immune reaction was a tremendous and impotent hatred.

Jack knew these things, because he could see his wife’s song lines,
traced in time and space like snail trails, on the GPS tracking window
he’d obtained from her wireless provider’s database. Jack, through his
privileged access as a corporate security officer, had been monitoring
his wife’s every credit card purchase, every email, had watched her
through a thousand intelligent surveillance cameras stationed throughout
the city. He knew that Joy had been lying to him for months. Every
weekday yoga class, every visit to her sister in Red Wood, every morning
when he would kiss her goodbye and they would both do their best to
soften their lips like sponges, as if to soak up the mess with
pleasantry into the trajectory of the past. Jack knew. And he never said
anything, would never say anything. Because Jack was a grown up, unlike
all of these frolicking, crunchy, nymph-like children, and that is what
grown ups do. They keep quiet about systemic problems and double down.
Bailout. They refinance.

&quot;Well, better run the place through the wash,&quot; Jack mumbled,
cracking the remaining sliver of Altoid, thin as communion host, against
the roof of his mouth. It was a comforting and familiar sensation.

Jack dialed in directives to the intra-cloud network, twitches of his
finger tips, read as input by his haptic gloves. A team of RPLCNTS
fanned out like an oil slick from the rear loading bay of the
carbon-black, behemoth class CyberSec vehicle. The roboSWAT team grouped
organically into squads following a flocking algorithm that Jack had
personally helped develop during a contracting project for the US
Department of Defense. Mostly the software was used to automate the
slaughter of Kenyans and Kazakstanis who, it was revealed, were sitting
on caches of lithium and copper the size of the Himalayan mountain
range. Lithium's and copper’s vital r&ocirc;les in electronics having replaced
long-peaked oil as the fulcrum for the next resource war, of course. The
ability of the human race to find new reasons to kill one another in the
face of insurmountable abundance was truly commendable. The advent of
the robotized ground troop solved the PR problem of flag-wrapped
coffins coming back from war zones, and the bleeding-heart journalist fodder
created when Predator drones accidentally blew up hospitals full of
Pakistani children went away. With those moral safeties clicked off,
half of Asia and most of Africa was leveled and strip-mined in less than
a decade by US robo-military campaigns.

The RPLCNTS immediately began securing the perimeter. Green zone was
demarcated on Jack’s heads-up-display by a film of lime-colored
territory spreading across an aerial map like algae in a pond. Through
an adjacent matrix of livestreaming troop feeds, Jack could see that the
bottom three floors of the San Francisco Giants building, even the
interiors, were blanketed in graffiti and gunshot holes. Primate pissing
matches played out in neon red and vomit-green street kanji, then
diplomacy continued by other means. Esoteric Kurt Vonnegut quotes and
six-foot-wide stenciled portraits of Che Guevara cried truths against
the wall of violence and misspelled inanity. These political art seemed
to post-date the rest, suggesting the gangs had either moved on or had
mutually assured one anothers’ destruction. The building was mostly
filled with countless grey-collars, the overeducated poor who’d either
been replaced in their office by a robot or who were enslaved to their
200k student loans, and for whom no job outside prostitution and unpaid
social work would ever come. They tended to their shoebox shitakes,
absorbed themselves in dead media like paper books and sculpture. Some
even played those face-to-face roleplaying video games called
&quot;theater". Jack and Stasia remotely questioned the denizens, most
of whom either had not seen the event or were too numb to care. The
drone SWAT teams encountered a few wyrehead junkies spewing braindead
strings of cursewords. One attempted to attack a soldrone with a ball
peen hammer.  The audio feed roared as what remained of the junkie's
brain was splattered all over his non-functioning refrigerator by the
bot's hollow point rounds. The sight made him feel uneasy, so Jack
changed channels.

&quot;No one else home,&quot; Stasia said, double checking a
satellite-based body heat scan of the building.

The arachnoid forensics bots continued the arduous task of scrubbing the
vicinity for evidence –marks, tracks, blood, DNA -- crawling physical
reality for every last byte of data, aggregating it in CyberSec’s
servers. What the Troubleshooters discovered was, well, troubling.

&quot;Christ, it’s like they edited out a slice of reality. All of the
security footage from CCTV cams, even the spydrones flying over during
the incident apparently came down with temporary cases of anterograde
amnesia. All our audiovisual records of that five minute period are
blank,&quot; Stasia said.

&quot;Yeah. Curious, isn’t it? Winklemann’s not going to be happy with
this.&quot;

Other than the corpse of the Deadweight accountant, the only real piece
of evidence were two Tyr X2 bodyguard robots. One had been mowed down,
so many bullet holes perforating its chrome chassis that it resembled a
cheese grater. Jack knelt down beside the collapsed humanoid, its
secret-service windbreaker ripped to shreds, its plastoid skin peeling
from its face like a third-degree sunburn.

&quot;That’s heavy weaponry they were carrying,&quot; Stasia commented.
Jack aimed his dVice camera at the QR barcode on the neck of the
android.

&quot;Assuming the assailant was carrying it. Let’s run these serial
numbers.&quot;

The other Tyr had a small puncture at the nape of its neck. Jack
examined the hole, inserting an arthroscopic microcam into the ‘wound’
and fishing around.

&quot;The central processor is fried,&quot; he added.

&quot;You thinking another bot glitch SNAFU?&quot; Stasia asked.

&quot;Maybe. A coincidental malfunction is certainly what they’d want us
to think happened, anyway. Hold on, Winklemann’s on the line.&quot; Jack
looked at the flashing avatar of his boss, expanding a videoconference
that occluded the charts and informatics of the investigation's
augmented reality overlays.

&quot;What have you got for me, Jack,&quot; Winklemann cut to it with
his eternally hurried, upper-managerial inflection.

&quot;The kid’s still unconscious but stable. Prognosis uncertain, it’s
50-50 whether he’ll snap out of the coma. We’ve got two body guards,
both owned by his parents. Where it gets interesting is we just cross
checked the Tyrs, and the bullets that Swiss-cheesed one bodyguard match
up with the .50 cal subdermal forearm cannon of its counterpart.&quot;

&quot;So the guard robot went Hal 9000, short circuited and started
shooting at friendlies. Wouldn’t be the first time, and at least since
this was bot-on-bot homicide we won’t have to blackout the story from
the internets like the School Bus incident down in Gnossis Plaza.&quot;

&quot;That’s possible but I highly doubt the culprit was buggy software.
For one, we just finished patching up the targeting systems heuristics
and enemy acquisition AIs for the entire drone fleet this morning. Then
there’s the fact that the BIOS clocks of the totaled Tyr and its
counterpart are frozen within seconds of each other, as if once the
puppeteer was done, he cut the strings from his marionette and made
off.&quot;

&quot;Puppeteer. That’s your diagnosis? Ok, fine, Mr. Conspiracy Theory. Roll it out for me.&quot;

&quot;I checked out the stab wound at the back of the other guard’s
neck. It’s bull’s-eye within a half-inch sized target, a backdoor port
into the Tyr’s system used for debugging purposes during beta testing.
Whoever struck the blow, it wasn’t just a reactionary defensive stab, it
was a calculated hostile takeover attack. These are not your run of the
mill necropolis street punks. They had intimate knowledge of Totech
android anatomy. Knew just the right switch to flip.&quot;

&quot;They could’ve gotten lucky, went for the bot’s head and scored the
central processor.&quot;

&quot;Highly unlikely. Residue analysis of the exposed wire and CPU
suggests that whatever the foreign object was, it was electrical.
Perhaps some kind of spine-based remote operation ice pick. There are no
signs of other firearms discharged in any of the visual or audio CCTV
feeds suggesting this guy was unarmed. These were professionals, black
hat hackers.&quot;

&quot;Fantastic, just what we need. Unwashed masses with brains. I
thought we had that problem kicked with reality TV and Angry Hamsters.
Goddamnit, times like these I wish we still had paper books so we could
torch them all like Fahrenheit 451. Who do you think is behind it,
assuming your theory is true?&quot;

&quot;There’s the usual suspects, the Washingtonians, but they spend too
much time bleating on about how government is trampling the US
constitution to reach that level of technical sophistication. And
they’re more about giving their lives for God and Country M16 in hand,
blaze of patriotic glory and all that. They’d probably view such an
attack as vaguely dishonorable commy-tactics. We can’t rule out a covert
strike by Pfeiffer Pharmaceutical or one of Vitanet’s other major
competitors looking to take out a VIP then use the circumstances to
frame the murder on jobless necropolis slumdogs. But if I had to, I’d
put my money on Hex Gen.&quot;

&quot;Generation Hex. Those V For Vendetta-guzzling hacktivists, of
course. Fine. Whoever the culprit, what we need to do right now is pin
the murder on World Class War. Hex Gen and WCW have had loose
associations and it’s going to be guilt by association 24/7.&quot;

&quot;Won’t that be a little challenging to spin? I mean we don’t even
know who the assailant is.&quot;

&quot;Nah, it’s no problem. Hell, since we’ve acquired MediaVerse, we’ve
got every major news channel, e-newspaper, and network on a tight leash
and the President is doing his part to declare all the whistleblowers
terrorists and have them disappeared systematically, no sweat off our
backs. Elections are coming up and it’s crucial that we crush popular
support of this underclass movement ASAP. Gnossis and our other generous
employers have dumped hundreds of billions of dollars into President
Vanderlyle’s campaign and it is absolutely imperative that he is sworn
into office for another term. Or it’s all of our heads, it goes without
saying. If we can just get that American Anti-Piracy Act passed we could
file all of the web censorship and attacks like this airstrike under the
blanket immunity clause of ‘defending US cybersecurity’. Make this all
so much easier.&quot;

&quot;Airstrike? What airstrike?&quot; Jack felt his temperature drop
two degrees, his stomach suddenly became a cold, sinking stone.

"Oh, right, you’re not in on this loop yet. Our ‘generous benefactors’,
the ones personally funding this operation, seems they need a certain
sense of closure. A nuclear, multi-block leveling, megaton sense of
closure.&quot;

An ill wind descended, drawing cryptic runes in the red desert of the
San Francisco sky, like the mark of some terrible and ancient alien
race, aroused from its epochal slumber. Bloated corpses drifted like
unprocessed lumps of sewage through the grey tide beneath the gaping
ruins of the Golden Gate. Omens. Preambles to the indiscriminate wrath
of infantile gods.

&quot;You’re serious,&quot; Jack mouthed. He felt his heart rate spike,
microscopic nanomed machines swimming in his arteries synthesized
angiotensin blockers automatically to counteract his heightened blood
pressure.

&quot;Am I affecting a humorous tone? Yes. I have an executive order
straight from the top to do a 426 on the entire area code.&quot; The
usual static from wireless communications borne by sketchy necropolis
cell towers suddenly cut out, as if emphasizing the message.

&quot;An LV426? Take off, nuke the site from orbit? Isn’t that kind of
overkill? I thought this was a crime scene, not a re-enactment of the
Hell’s Kitchen Predator drone massacre.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that wasn’t our fault, we had bad intel from the CIA.
Besides, it was a festering sore of jobless insurgents. The World Class
War mobs had publicly executed the CEO of Nationwide Bank, hung him by
his own tie from the Wall Street Bull. For fucks sake, they nearly took
down a fifty story corporate tower with explosives concocted from
nothing but gene-hacked ammonia-rich algae and pinesol. Fucking algae
bombs! You ever heard of that shit? An example had to be made. Top it
off, yeah, come on you stingy whore.&quot; Jack could hear the tinkle of
crystal champagne flutes through Winkleman’s phone, the oceanic burble
of a party crowd, live smooth jazz.

&quot;Carpet bombing fourteen city blocks worth of apartments full of
families who had nothing to do with the movement at all? That was
setting an example?&quot;

&quot;Jack, Jack. My boy. Of course I don’t want to see innocent people
killed any more than you do. Of course we’d prefer to control the hoi
polloi with hope. It’s much more efficient in the cost-benefit analysis
to have people believing, falsely, that they can Be Whatever They Want
When They Grow Up in America, satisfied with their McDonald’s
shit-shoveling job limping along on foodstamps and Wal Mart as long as
they can turn on their ‘Tubevisions and strive to be American Idols and
Jersey Shore Playgirls one day. But with this… extent to which things
have managed to deteriorate, it’s becoming harder and harder to sell the
shit sandwiches as caviar, convince the people that their debt shackles
are their tickets to a better life. So now we’ve got to rely on good old
fashioned People’s Republic of China-style fear of Authority with an
itchy trigger finger. It’s – what do those World Class War lefty
financial journalists call it? Moral Hazard. That’s it.  This is about
reinstating moral hazard. There’s got to be an equal and opposite
deterrent to the degree of outrage in the general population. They start
getting the cajones up to cut the heads off the royalty, well, we’ve got
to fire an ion cannon at the poorer half of Manhattan. Now they know the
hazard of being moral. One day you will understand how business actually
works, son.&quot;

&quot;Alright. Fine. You need to put shock and awe back into the hearts
of the irreverent peasants. I just don’t see how indiscriminately
blowing up random swaths of population, many of whom are not necessarily
active World Class War members or part of any other resistance movements
is going to draw down support for WCW. Cause it just seems like we’re
going to have another World Trade Center’s worth of unemployed martyrs,
all of whom will have mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who
will be filled with fiery jihad, devoting the rest of their lives to
taking down the ‘Plutocrats’, the Great Satans who stole their loved
ones and destroyed their lives. Why not just go after the extremists?
The insurgents who are doing actual damage taking out Ameribank City
financial towers, assassinating hedge fund managers and actively
plotting to bring down the global financial system. I mean these people
here, they’re just human beings who got the dirty end of the
stick.&quot; Jack could feel his inner lawyer suddenly flipping to the
side of the smelly hippies he’d silently despised minutes ago, once he
was asked to massacre them.

&quot;Christ, don’t refer to them as ‘human beings’. Don’t do that to
yourself; it’s bad for your psyche, all this humanizing of your victims.
Unbecoming of a Troubleshooter. No, thank you Sylvia, I’m fine. Tell the
governor I’ll be out in a minute,&quot; Winkleman said to someone at
whatever $10 million-a-plate dinner function or economics conference he
was attending, slurping down what sounded like some kind of chilled
shellfish on the line. He cleared his throat, continued.

&quot;Look, Mother Theresa, I’m not going to spend all day arguing
asymmetric warfare ethics with you. This is a direct order and you WILL
execute. Diamond wants someone, anyone, to pay for his son’s death. Maybe
he’s overreacting; whatever, it’s moot. Alistair Diamond is one of our
largest and most well-connected shareholders, and happens to be the
brother of the Cybersecurity Senate Subcommittee head, the group that
will make or break the American Anti-Piracy Act. I don’t care if Diamond
asks CyberSec to assassinate the President of China or mow down a
Catholic school full of Canadian children with Panzer tanks or open up a
singularity at Earth’s core just so he can laugh at the poor below,
martini in hand, from his low-orbit ISS villa’s swimming pool. You will
execute, Jack, or you will find yourself, very soon, jobless, cowering
in one of these decrepit Plebian sinkholes without running water,
imagining your wife and kid kissing some other man with steelier balls
than you who took your job, wondering with your last breath why you
ever for one moment had second thoughts about your vocation’s duties
both to CyberSec and to Ameribank City. And then your life will end,
horribly and without even an acknowledgement in your former friends’
status updates, beneath the great vengeance and furious anger of a
drone-fired CyberSec lead zeppelin, just like the one you’re about to
call down on the tens of thousands of people eeking out their pathetic,
gutter-moss-and-cardboard-box lives in that wasteland called San
Francisco.&quot; Serious as bioengineered, weapons-grade cancer.

&quot;Oh, I should add. There’s a juicy forty-k bonus tied to this
mission as well, plus a week-long paid junket in Switzerland for you and
your wife upon completion. The President Wilson Hotel, Imperial Suite.
Only the best for Ameribank City’s Finest. The monk seal sashimi there
is mind boggling. You’ve gotta try it.&quot;

The endangered cuisine wasn’t exactly Jack’s cup of tea, but the $40,000
would be enough to keep their daughter in private school another
semester, maybe pull them above water in their mortgage payments long
enough for Jack and his wife to spend a few dinner table conversations
not fighting about money. Jack could feel his angels and demons being
shouted off his shoulders by the megaphone of Darwinian survival. There
were breadlines of double PhDs and former IT workers gunning for Jack’s
position. Jack didn’t have the luxury of not working. He couldn’t think
about what would happen if he lost his job and he and his family fell
behind in their citizenship payments.

&quot;Well, hey, Jack! It’s been great chatting, but I’ve got a couple
of hundred thousand dollar human trafficked Yugoslavian sex slaves here
that I need to ruin before the night is over, followed by 18 holes with
the governor of Texas and the CEO of Caco Cola on board his
two-mile-wide airship. Insider trading tips, brainstorming ways to get
students and homeowners deeper in debt, reversing progressive labor
rights, oh, and there’s that damned Financial Fraud Protection Act that
we need to have congress defang now that their election season is over.
All that boring stuff I know you don’t like hearing about. Get this, the
zeppelin's gas bags are built entirely with paper recycled from back
issues of Atlas Shrugged! Who knew you could make fricking blimps out of
paper? You learn something new everyday. Anyway, I’ll leave you to your
mass murdering now. Do try to enjoy your work, Jack. It’s important to
take joy in your work. Remember, you’re one of our best. I have faith in
you, my boy. Sylvia! Jesus, that’s my ballsa-&quot; The signal cut out.

Muther fucking vindictive mega-rich parents. That acquired sociopathy
born when a hundred floors of money are placed between the rich and
their fellow human beings, running their Starbucks coffee and polishing
their thousand dollar shoes below. What were simple butchers, bakers,
and candlestick makers with feelings and lives and families, from two
thousand feet in an autopiloted Gulfstream, suddenly became nothing but
ants, insects. To be crushed beneath boot heels. Jack discovered that
familiar and burning hatred for Winklemann, for the Diamond family who’d
ordered him here to commit their war crimes free of the &quot;cognitive
load&quot;, outsourcing the heavy crucifix onto Jack’s shoulders. Jack
insulated himself in that hot membrane of hate and blame, and it
assuaged any sense of guilt long enough for him to carry out what he had
to carry out.

&quot;Stasia, I need you to de-activate all 3G + spectrums and cut all
landline connections in and out of District 8, sectors A-F.&quot;

&quot;Why, Jack? What’s going on? What did Winklemann say?&quot;

Jack strode briskly toward the CyberSec APC, jumped into the front seat,
and grabbed the intercom mic on the dashboard of the cockpit. It was too
quiet out. No bombshells rumbling in the distance, no gunshots tapping
off. Not even the screams of domestic violence and meth-induced Tourette's
syndrome. One of those peculiar moments of peace when a hundred
simultaneous Plebland skirmishes reach the same brief lull. As if all of
San Francisco was holding its breath in anticipation, awaiting the
market correction, the return to the equilibrium level of violence. Jack
switched on the loudspeaker, static and feedback piercing the silent
night, ricocheting off the concrete squalor.

"Everyone, get out of here. Now. Get as far away as you can.&quot;

&quot;Why? What’s happening?&quot; East shouted back from his Matson
container garden.

&quot;Look, trust me, just get out of here. The drones are going to
retaliate.&quot;

&quot;But, we have done nothing wrong! We have sowed no evil. Why would
they attack us?&quot;

&quot;It doesn’t matter. The reaping is coming, either way. Old
Testament style. The hellfire and the brimstone.&quot;

&quot;I don’t trust him. Look at him, he’s got one of them special agent
rent-a-cops uniforms on. What they call them?&quot; someone shouted from
an apartment window.

&quot;Troubleshooters.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. We ain’t listening to you, you goddamn Troubleshooter thug.
You just trying to smoke us out.&quot;

&quot;Fascist!&quot;

&quot;We ain’t going nowhere.&quot; A small crowd had gathered now in
the street, perhaps a few dozen, outside the Giants Museum. East
stepped forward from the group, approached the front door of the APC
where Jack sat holding the mic. His dreadlocks were dancing burnt-gold
vines as the wind picked up, sang through the abandoned buildings like
the haunting wail of a seashell. East examined the light-absorbing hull
of the vehicle’s urban camo finish.

&quot;Harbinger of death.&quot; East said, crossing his arms.

&quot;I’m sorry, East, this isn’t my fault. They would’ve just called in
someone else,&quot; Jack protested.

&quot;Save your words, Wraith. I knew you cared about nothing the moment
you arrived.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you think of me, it doesn’t matter. You’ve got to tell
them,&quot; Jack said, &quot;They won’t listen to me.&quot;

East shook his head. &quot;You said I could trust you, Jack. We
co-operated, gave you what you wanted. You said we’d be ok. You asked me
to trust you and now you are bringing the great flood of fire upon our
home, upon our community. Now I understand, Wraith man. You are indeed
the rider of the final machine. Terminus Machina. But you are not a Bent
One, Wraith. You are merely empty. You are hollow as the Tin Men whom
you command like clockwork figurines, toy soldiers who kill and enslave
my people. You are a master of gadgets, yet you yourself are a gadget, a
gadget of the truly Bent. For unlike the Bent, you understand what you
do, but you do it anyway. I will pray to all the gods for your soul,
Jack the Wraith, for I cannot imagine a worse fate. You are an emptiness
unlike any that I have ever known. I will pray for you.&quot; Jack could
see the dark smile lines branching beneath East’s eyes begin to fill
with water, could see the sadness pull at his face. A man of action,
like Jack, East forced emotion aside, steeled himself and took the
microphone.

"Everyone, please, get out of here. Get as far as you can. Do not waste
time with belongings. Run.&quot; East’s amplified voice reverberated
against the city, echoes rising like a tide, and the people, hearing one
of their leaders proclaim the end times, began to flee like scattering
ants.

&quot;Stasia, I need you to black out all internet traffic in a twelve
block radius,&quot; Jack summoned a map of the Bay Area, toggled off
markers for all drone units except heavy aircraft.

&quot;What are you talking about, Jack? What’s going on?&quot; Stasia
asked, voice trilling with hysteria, like a canary descending, against
its will, into a coal mine.

&quot;Just shut down the land lines and cell towers, now. We need to get
a head start on the damage control, minimize the chance of word getting
out.&quot; Jack pinpointed the nearest suitable drone, a monster
annihilator like an F-16 on steroids, carrying enough firepower to turn
Manhattan into the Yucatan crater.

&quot;Control damage from what? Jack? Tell me!&quot; Jack ignored her
demands, knowing that she might object to the order if she understood
what it was she was doing.

<img src="bailout2.jpg">

A few decades ago, nuking a national landmark sports stadium in a major
US city would've been immediately branded a cataclysmic terrorist attack
at best, and the kindling for World War III at worst. Today it was <i>de
rigeur</i> cost-of-doing-business, a meteorological process, a bad
thunderstorm, and everyone would whip out their umbrellas till the
shower of retaliatory tit-for-tats, news reports passed. Barely worthy
of a front page trending topic.

"Alright, Jack, it's done. All relays, hubs are off, no packets leaving
the space, not even the faintest HAM radio signal. There's an effective
Faraday cage enclosing all of SoMa. Now can you clue me in to what the
hell this is about?"

&quot;Look, I can’t believe we’re being forced to do this either, but
they've ordered a thermonuclear facelift of everything within two miles
of the crime scene. A grudge-nuke special requested by the Diamond
family. And our bosses are finding their own uses for the bombing.
They’re asking us to wipe this entire area code off the face of the
Earth, and then they're going to frame World Class War as the
perpetrators. 'The heat seeking mechanisms on those stinger missiles
degrade rapidly in this humid climate.' 'They should've asked the
Russians for an extended warranty on that warhead.' 'Seems they forgot
to RTFM on that suitcase antimatter bomb. Detonated that tactical
city-buster on themselves. Shame.' That's the official story they're
going to put out."

&quot;Jesus Christ, Jack! Think of all those people! There’s no way
they’ll be able to evacuate in time, you’re talking about blowing up
dozens of blocks worth of people leading peaceful lives. Families."

&quot;Don’t humanize them, like that. It doesn’t suit you, Us, as
Troubleshooters.&quot; Jack repeated his boss’s words that he’d so
despised mere minutes earlier. Stasia’s eyes crumpled up into that
Scandinavian grimace of universal pain, that frowning Siberian husky
look flowing from an overgrown sense of altruism. He could see the
bright light of innocent passion in her eyes being torn apart by the
tidal forces of market reality. He remembered how it had felt that first
time executing the death warrant on an innocent, and it hurt him to see
her hurt like that, but everyone had to grow up some time.

&quot;Jack! We can’t do this! We… I can’t do this. We might mow down
armed insurgents marching into Gnossis Plaza, even take out key leaders
and fomenters of populist resistance. But I can’t allow all these
innocent people to be slaughtered so needlessly, just to sate some
insane, power-drunk Plutocrat’s infantile need for vengeance. I just
can’t allow it.&quot; Stasia’s hand had unconsciously begun to reach for
the .45 caliber slung from her hip. Jack frowned, made a cat's cradle
around her blip in his heads-up display. A pair of roboSWAT drew
together on Stasia’s flank, a swarm of red laser dots converging on her
head like a disco ball. Stasia choked, eyeing the black cold barrels of
a dozen rifles surrounding her. She lowered her hand, and lowered her
head in defeat and shame.

&quot;I’m sorry. I won’t tell anyone about this. Imagine that this never
happened, if you can. Close your eyes.&quot; He caught her as she
collapsed into him. He held her, feeling her hot young tears burning
along his neck like holy water. But it did not, he would not, allow it to
faze him. He continued to work even as she broke down, typing commands
into his interface, fixing these ‘bugs’ in the Ameribank system.
Troubleshooting. His skull throbbed with adrenaline and conflict, his
hands shook as he began the process of programming the drone attack, but
if he kept his head just in the right headspace, he could spin the guilt
in his head as bravery and valor, and he held onto that moment like
an alcoholic wife beater to a Sunday sermon.

Jack dialed in latitude, longitude, anchored the crosshair on the corner
of King Street and 3rd. Drew a blast radius with his pinky, as if wiping
a smudge from a blemished hardwood table. Is this nuclear strike
acceptable? (Yes/No) Yes. Would you like to include _chemical
_biological agents in this attack? (Check all that apply) Would you like
Atrocity Cleanser Version 6.0 to establish internet traffic censors and
pre-emptive buy up of search engine keywords associated with this
airstrike? (Yes/No) Yes. Would you like SMS alerts of escalating death
toll? (Yes/No) No. Please enter your user name and launch codes now.

An investigative journalist was detected in the vicinity by a patrolling
stealth-drone running facial rec examinations on the panicked crowd
running from the site. Jack entered a console command and one of the
RPLCNTs hounded the journalist’s GPS, sprayed him with fully automatic
fire till his body stopped twitching, tossed the corpse in a dumpster. A
mother and child were hit by stray bullets, but the RPLCNTs did not
waver from their predesignated courses sweeping up 'loose ends'. The
father was left to sit on his knees, wail over his young dead family at
ground zero, waiting to be put out of his misery by the cleansing fire
of the behemoth-class bomber drone.

&quot;The Archangel is inbound. Time for us to leave.&quot; Jack said.
Stasia sobbed, made no eye contact as she climbed into the rear of the
APC. Jack slammed the heavy reinforced door shut, ignored the screaming
and pounding on the bullet proof glass as the Deadweights tried
desperately to get in, to save themselves from the coming tactical
apocalypse. Toddlers were held up to the window by parents, pleading
that their children might be spared.

&quot;Jack…&quot; Stasia began.

&quot;We can’t. They’d overrun us if we opened that door.&quot; There
was nothing to be done. No one would bail them out.

The APC rolled out, post-haste, towards the Bay Bridge, as the Archangel
reared its self-piloted head. Wingspan twice the width of the bridge
itself, the nuclear drone was like a fissure in the heavens, an ebon
maw, grinning wider as it approached.  An array of oblong metal raked
white stripes across the bloody sky, howling at a supersonic clip in the
direction of the Golden Gate. Jack blocked out the irony.

The nuke's marigold blast wave wiped skyscrapers away like cardboard
boxes in a hurricane. It reminded Jack of watching footage from the 2011
Japanese tsunami, being glued to the screen despite the ineffably
terrible event transpiring, unable to look away. Seeing it now, Jack
knew no one could’ve escaped the bomb. Why did he tell the people to
run, why didn’t he tell them to spend their last moments saying goodbye
to one another? East, his daughter, the hippy girls hanging their
clothes, they might’ve made it out of the kill zone in time, if they had
wheels. Maybe they managed to get that VW bus engine to turn. Maybe
there’d be gas. Jack needed to believe that they survived, though a part
of him, the part of him that debugged paramilitary AI firmware, knew
that they were all dead, every last one. His mind’s eye rendered them
now, three tall and one short, a family of nuclear shadows, stenciled on
the incinerated flank of a Starbucks. Too much reality. Jack could taste
the stink.

Jack disliked violence. Just thinking about all the immolated innocents
and wailing mothers clinging to lifeless bloody messes that used to be
their children outside his APC window made Jack queasy. He pulled an
abstracted wireframe overlay like a curtain over reality, transforming
the flying body parts into little gold arcade game coins. Adding up to a
$40,000 bonus. This was why Jack preferred to work from the office, have the
robots do all the dirty work; it was all so uncivilized, this war stuff.
It made things much easier, seeing destroyed communities as housing
statistics. Debugged code. Figures in a spreadsheet. He could handle
that.  Jack wondered how anyone ever got any work done before computers.
Jack told himself that he was doing all of this for his wife and
daughter, to float their teetering middle class existence, that he had
no choice but to double down, to refinance. Jack opened a fluffy
talkshow in the upper right corner, tried to focus on the topic which
was the hipness or tastelessness Lord Dada’s dildo-shaped speedo at the
Grammys. Jack felt better already.

The trick, Jack reminded himself, always lay in depersonalization,
complication, obfuscation of the massacre into financial numerology.
Market efficiency, supply and demand, and that’s all this was. The
demand for extermination of unwanted humans was skyrocketing, and Jack
was merely filling the niche before someone else did. The holocaust was
simple rational self-interest; what makes the world go round, get off
your high moral horse. Maximized profit in a spreadsheet column. Jack
could feel the thoughts absolving his conscience already, ensconcing his
mind like a warm balm, like Pontius Pilate’s spa and cucumber mask. Jack
checked his Friendbook feeds; smiled as he commented on a picture of
some cousin stuffing jell-o shots in a drunken fiance’s mouth. Jack
fired up a game of Angry Hamsters. He imagined the megaton missiles
screaming overhead toward the San Francisco ground zero as slingshot
rodents, crashing humorously into 8-bit wooden castles. The mounting
dead were cartoon pigs with ‘x’s on their eyes, each adding points to
Jack’s high score. Within seconds of playing, East and his daughter, the
squatter community, the airstrike, all that unmediated, untargeted
reality ceased to exist, and there was only the flash and bleep of the
rectangular screen, the soothing reptilian dreamstate of the video game.

[*ITEM] Not Who We Are

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] "Does not everything depend on our interpretation of the silence around us?"
<br>- <small>Lawrence Durrell - Justine.</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Taig brushed driven snow from the sign
before stepping back and reading aloud. &quot;This is a Clear Conscience
zone. No criminal acts can be performed.&quot; He turned to Floyd.
&quot;You sure that gizmo of yours is still working? I didn’t come this
far only to turn myself in ‘cos it’s the right thing to do.&quot; 

Floyd shrugged, the gesture almost lost beneath the two overcoats he was
wearing against the biting wind. &quot;Don’t sweat it. This heightened
sense of right and wrong is a mere slap on the wrist compared to the
full-blown justice field back on Harris Island. We’ll be able to move
further from my ‘gizmo’, as you call it, but no more than fifty yards to
be on the safe side.&quot;

Alice shivered. &quot;Then bloody well turn it on and let’s find
someplace warm. I’m sick of the cold.&quot;

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.

Floyd reached into the bag slung across his chest and I heard the soft
<I>thrum</I> of unshielded electronics. He was a genius, but should have
been in an institute for the criminally insane rather than the Harris
Island Correctional Facility. However, the authorities were so intent on
proving the justice field could cope with <I>anyone</I> that he’d been
shipped in amidst intense media coverage.

And for a while he’d seemed like the model prisoner; placid, courteous
and socially responsible. They’d made use of his talents in the
technical recycling department, stripping redundant equipment of usable
parts and melting down the rest.

Man, was <I>that</I> a mistake.&#9;

Somehow he managed to cobble together a blank-box from scrap without
infringing his new-found sense of what constituted criminal behaviour.
Harris Island didn’t have walls, or even guards. You didn’t need them
when the inmates <I>knew</I> they should be in prison and remained there
of their own volition. Floyd’s gizmo negated the justice field over a
radius of ten feet, far enough to include the four of us.

The wind howled around us, kicking up frosted snowflakes that stung any
exposed flesh like nettles. Although the weather had let up, the leaden
skies made for less than ideal flying conditions. We had to find cover
before Justice Department drones started scouring the landscape for a
group containing two of their ‘most wanted’.  

Alice strode beyond the sign and turned, hand on hip. &quot;Are we
making a move or what? You brought us all the way out here and I’m still
waiting to see the benefit of sticking together.&quot;

Floyd put on his patient voice. &quot;It needed four of us to handle the
heavy rowboat and we needed a non-threatening woman to knock on the
first door we came to. Our little home invasion will no doubt have been
discovered by now, so we need a <I>change</I> of clothes if we’re to
blend in on reaching the city.&quot;

Taig glowered at him. &quot;Yeah, but Fairview? A gated community?
High-end means high-risk in my book.&quot;

&quot;But with restricted access only on the landward side, Taig.&quot;
Floyd started walking, a peculiar high-stepping gait as if the snow was
somehow contaminated. &quot;Plus, being out of season, residences on the
peninsula will be closed down for the most part.&quot;

&quot;Like that one?&quot; Alice stood on the crest of a slight incline,
pointing down the slope beyond.

The three of us joined her. Floyd nodded. &quot;Like that one.&quot;

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.

It was a large house in the neo-colonial style but obviously newly
built. The driveway was a sweep of white, unsullied by tyre marks or
footprints. Evergreens shielded it from neighbouring residences, with
the only open vista being the direction we were approaching from.

Taig sounded dubious. &quot;Turning over that place back-a-ways was one
thing, but somewhere this big is bound to have alarms, motion sensors,
the works.&quot;

Floyd sighed. &quot;No, Taig, it won’t. The owner doesn’t need a
security system because no criminal acts can be performed here,
remember? We can just stroll up and force entry. Hell, the place might
even be unlocked.&quot;

So we struggled, rather than strolled, through the snow and round to the
back door. Taig went to kick the lock in but Floyd raised a hand.
&quot;Wait! Now, listen up. There will be some kind of computerised
housekeeping system. Maybe an A-I, but more likely just smart
environmental controls. It will be in hibernation mode, meaning we can’t
do anything that might trigger an alert. So, no temperature variations,
in fact no use of utilities whatsoever.&quot;

Alice frowned. &quot;No temperature variations? You mean we can’t turn
the heating up? Shit.&quot;

&quot;Exactly. No using the cooker either, or running the taps. There’s
bound to be an open fire we can light though, and if we need water then
put some snow in a pan.&quot;

Taig put his elbow through a small glass door panel. &quot;You’re saying
that if I take a dump I can’t flush?&quot;

Our genius inclined his head. &quot;Regrettably, yes. However in a place
of this size there are sure to be multiple restrooms, more than enough
to go round for the limited time we’ll be here.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Taig reached in, unlocked the door and closed it
behind us once we were all inside. He peeled off the shawl around his
neck and stuffed it into the empty frame. 

Alice shed her outer layers. &quot;What about food? If you say we can’t
eat anything then I’ll have your arm off, Floyd, I swear to God.&quot;

He smiled. &quot;No, no, that will be fine. Just don’t put any used
cartons or cans in the trash, in case they have microtags for automated
reordering. Other than that, feel free to make use of whatever you can
find.&quot;

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.

Floyd placed his gizmo in the living room and we split up. I hit the kitchen
for some crackers and cheese while Taig smashed up the dining room
chairs to serve as firewood. Once he had it going, Alice came over all
domestic goddess and emptied cans of soup into a big pot. They wedged it
in place over the fire using a poker, although by the looks of things it
would take ages to reach anything like warm. I don’t know what Floyd was
doing, probably hacking the house computer and bringing down some
international banking system. That’s what he was good at.

I found a bedroom on the second floor complete with <i>en suite</i> 
facilities. After
cleaning up – and remembering not to flush – I raked around for more
suitable clothes than my HICF jumpsuit and stolen outerwear. One of the
dudes who hung out here was a size or so larger than me, but that loose
fit was back in vogue – I watch a lot of TV. I even dry-shaved as
stubble didn’t sit well with the herringbone three-piece suit I went
for.

The four of us reassembled in the lounge to try Alice’s
tomato-chicken-pea fusion soup. At least it was hot. She had scored some
classy threads and really looked the part, like she belonged in these
surroundings. Taig, well, Taig was just a brute in an ill-fitting suit.
Floyd had gone for pants and open-necked shirt, with a sweater knotted
casually around his shoulders. There was a slightly crazed smile on his
lips that didn’t bode well.

Floyd set his plate aside. &quot;I kept us together to minimise the risk
of being spotted and I think you’ll agree I’ve done a good job up to
this point. However, now we have to split up. The authorities will be
looking for a group of four, or four individuals, so I suggest we head
out as couples. I’ll go with Alice, naturally, while you two boys will
have to make like a gay couple enjoying a winter break.&quot;

Taig sneered at him. &quot;What do you mean, ‘naturally’. I’m the kind
of guy who would have a doll like Alice on his arm, not you.&quot;

Floyd arched an eyebrow. &quot;Really? I wouldn’t put you together
unless it was some kind of car-parking scenario, or maybe carrying her
groceries out of the supermarket.&quot;

Taig stood, flexing his powerful shoulders in a way that put his new
suit under considerable strain. &quot;Everyone says how you’re so smart,
a regular genius. Well, you got us out, and you got us here, but all
those brains don’t count for nothing now, understand? I was a drug
dealer, started on street corners and climbed up by doing what the other
guy wouldn’t. I put guys in hospital, put them in the ground, but I got
smarts as well, savvy?&quot; He tapped the side of his head.

Floyd sneered at him. &quot;Oh, I get you, a regular Keyzer Soze. Most
impressive.&quot;

&quot;Who’s he?&quot;

&quot;Never mind. The point is, Taig, that you and simply Alice don’t
fit together. You’re trash and always will be. At least she’s acquired a
veneer of sophistication through high-end prostitution.&quot;

Alice snorted. &quot;Gee, thanks! And don’t I get a say in all this?
What about silent-boy here? Parker?&quot;

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.

Floyd dismissed me with a wave of his hand. &quot;Impossible. I don’t
know why he was incarcerated at Harris Island but he more properly
belongs in a mental institution.&quot;

&quot;You’re a fine one to talk.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Alice, that will be enough. At least Parker knows how
to follow orders and keep his mouth shut. Behaviour you’d be wise to
emulate, Taig.&quot;

Taig hit him, straight fingers to the throat. Floyd staggered back,
choking, disbelief plain upon his face. Taig lifted a chair leg and
struck Floyd about the face as he sank to his knees and fell over.

For a moment the only sounds were Taig’s heavy breathing and the
cracking fire. Then he turned to me, brandishing the bloody length of
wood. &quot;You step out of line, you get the same.&quot;

Alice looked between the two of us. &quot;Aren’t you going to warn
him?&quot;

Taig frowned at her. &quot;Warn him? I just did.&quot;

She sighed. &quot;Not you, numbnuts, Parker.&quot;

I kicked the poker into the air, grabbed the handle and thrust the
glowing point up into Taig’s abdomen. All the way in, until the red-hot
metal reached his heart. I stepped back as he stood there swaying,
staring at me open-mouthed. The chair leg fell from his hand.

Alice smiled. &quot;He’s a serial killer, Taig. The ‘Monday Morning
Murderer’ they called him. I recognised Parker straight off as most of
his victims were call-girls, but I hoped he’d get rid of you as
well.&quot;

Taig toppled backwards like a falling log. He lay still on the carpet,
sizzling slightly.

Alice took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eye. &quot;Now
what? Are you going to kill me as well?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;Until Floyd showed up I was slated to be the star
attraction at Harris Island. A violent psychopath, tamed by the justice
field generator. That was all a lie, though. I have an imbedded impulse
controller, like an enforced conscience, to keep me from re-offending. I
was safe to walk the streets but they wanted a high-profile inmate to
show the broadcast technology worked.&quot;

&quot;So you can speak, after all. But Floyd’s blank-box, how…?&quot;

&quot;The interference from the blank-box reset my controller to its factory
specifications, before any kind of ethical parameters were programmed
in. So now I’m a functioning sociopath rather than psychopath, although
society may not consider that much of an improvement. I could have
walked into the Clear Conscience zone without Jiminy Cricket popping up
on my shoulder, and I can walk out just as easily.&quot;

Alice folded her arms. &quot;On your own?&quot;

&quot;On my own. I’ll leave you the gizmo but I don’t play well with
others. The private security who guard this place are more concerned
with keeping people out, so they’ll probably just wave you through.
There’s a car in the garage you could use, if walking seems a bit out of
character for someone who lives here. You might get past the gate before
the LoJack kicks in, but in any event don’t push your luck.&quot;

&quot;But you intend to just stroll out?&quot;

I extended one foot. &quot;Walking boots. Obviously someone who lives
here isn’t averse to healthy exercise so I’ll just trade on the
precedent. And if anyone tries to stop me I’ll kill them.&quot;

&quot;Just like that?&quot;

I nodded. &quot;Just like that. The hardware in my head makes me immune
to all ethical and moral restraints, just as it suppresses any homicidal
impulses. I can kill, or just as easily not kill, as the situation
demands. I’m truly indifferent…Goodbye, Alice.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Parker.&quot;

I turned away, my voice hoarse from so much use. There was a long
overcoat hanging by the back door and I took that, although it was too
snug to fasten over my suit. I also took a long-bladed kitchen knife
from the block, just in case. I walked down the drive and headed for the
main road, passing several other residences which appeared closed for
the winter. 

It took me the best part of twenty minutes to reach the main gate with
its guardhouse and single occupant. He was leafing through a girly
magazine in front of a battery of CCTV monitors, all showing sections of
the perimeter wall. I rapped on the glass door and he started, jumping
up and fumbling his cap into place before answering.  

&quot;Sorry, sir, just catching up on some, ah, technical manuals.
Walking into town? Well, at least the snow is supposed to hold
off.&quot; He pressed a button and the pedestrian gate swung open. The
guard hesitated and I gripped the handle of my knife. &quot;I saw the
chimney smoke, sir, but the previous guard didn’t inform me the property
was in use. I’ll make sure you’ll be expected back, don’t you
worry.&quot; I let the silence drag out. He touched his cap. &quot;Good
day to you, sir.&quot;

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.
  
At the bottom of the approach road, where it joined the highway, was a
forlorn bus stop. Well, the hired help for the big houses had to get out
here somehow. The timetable screen lit up as it sensed my approach, but
there wasn’t a service going anywhere for hours. Just hanging about
wasn’t an option, for obvious reasons, so I started walking towards the
city. 

After a few hundred yards I heard a car engine approaching from behind.
Glancing round I expected it to be Alice in the stolen four-by-four, but
instead, a neat roadster pulled up beside me. The soft top was down, but
it looked more like mechanical dilapidation than stylistic verve. The
driver was a young woman wearing a fur coat and last night's makeup. 

She smiled. &quot;Need a lift as far as a coffee shop?&quot;

I slid in beside her, noting the short dress and folded red parasol on
the parcel shelf. My hands twitched. &quot;You’re a whore.&quot;

&quot;Ouch! And hello to you too, mister. Despite the clothes, it’s
obvious you don’t belong here, same as me. So less of the attitude or
you can freeze your ass off walking to the Metro.&quot;

&quot;Merely an observation.&quot;

We pulled away, fishtailing in the slush. &quot;Well, for your
information, I’m an escort, a paid companion, and <I>that’s</I>
completely legal. Anything else which may have occurred was spontaneous
sex between two consenting adults.&quot;

I shrugged. &quot;I know the correct form of words.&quot;

The woman shot me a sideways glance. &quot;I bet. So what are you then,
a gigolo? I’m not getting a rent boy vibe.&quot; 

The road was an empty avenue between rows of pine trees. I shivered
slightly, but not because of the cold. &quot;It’s not who we are that
defines us, but what we do. That can change from day to day, from hour
to hour. All that matters is the thought and the deed.&quot;

&quot;What’s that supposed to mean?&quot;

In that moment I was my own creation, slave to neither impulse nor
expectation. If I killed it was a conscious decision to fashion reality
in my image. &quot;Pull over, I need to explain myself. My name is
Parker.&quot;

She frowned at me. &quot;Well, Parker, I’m Rachel. I’ll pull over, but
you better have a damn good story to tell.&quot; The car slithered to a
halt.

I said nothing. I don’t talk much.

[*ITEM] Day Trip

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] There's nothing worse than alien food when sightseeing.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Dr Rastus and I went to look at the little
caldera in the warm, velvety twilight. We could smell it before we saw
the infrared glow and heat haze above the small crater, a stink like a
salt marsh, but hotter. It was surrounded by a raised rim of shiny lava
rock, warm and comfortable to lean on. We peered over the edge at the
black crust, shot with fiery cracks. Dr Rastus's fur was burning but he
didn't believe me, not until the sharp scent of incinerated hair cut
across the miasma of hydrogen sulphide. Then he squealed and thrashed
his arms about, hitting me by mistake, but his hands were very soft, so
the blow landed like a cushion. He and his fellow Malachanian, Dr
Surlibob, were colleagues at the Institute. They did a lot of squealing,
and that, together with their portly bearing and snoutish heads, made
them look rather like big furry pigs that had learned to walk upright.
Their hands and feet, however, were huge and mobile, and their eyes were
beautiful - big, brown, with dark lashes, like an Earthly movie actress
of the twentieth century.

As we wandered back to the carriage Dr Jumjum joined us. She was
extremely amorphous and lumbering, like a creature designed for a marine
existence, which her race, of course, originally was. The Faloons had
evolved in a totally different manner from humans and Malachanians,
rather like amoebas, and, in repose, she resembled a dirty pink inflatable sofa.
She could change shape at will, and quickly; she could sprout legs,
tentacles and multiple eye stalks. At this point in time, she looked like
a cross between a hippo and a two-trunked elephant. She had admirable tentacular
dexterity, and she spoke Anglic by forming an air-filled cavity in her
skin, furnishing it with tongue and lips, and mouthing the air out. "I
daren't go any nearer that volcano, dears," she said, "The hydrogen
sulphide puts me to sleep, you know." This being the third time she'd
told us, we mumbled our understanding.

It was getting late. We had started our outing early to view the famous
Great Rift, a ten metre wide, two kilometre deep, chasm with lava
flowing in it. This was the main tourist attraction on the planet, but
some of us at the Institute had never seen it. We had lunched at a native
inn, where we were served a number of dubious 'delicacies'. Dr Rastus had
eaten enthusiastically, I less so, and Dr Jumjum hardly at all.
We were on the last lap home to the Institute. The sun was low in
the sky, and it was cold. Nevertheless, we might very well have got back
into the quaint native carriage and completed the day trip without
incident if it had not started to hail. Hail in these parts graduated in
size from grape pips through grapeshot to grapefruit. This hail was at
the low end, stinging but not dangerous. The lead draftanimal, however,
reacted by going  'poomhuff' (an ill-understood fugue state of
draftanimals precipitated by a dread of frostbite), breaking its
pullchains, opening its wingcases and flying off towards the plane of
the ecliptic. You hear about this kind of thing happening, but poomhuff
was pretty rare even back then. Of course, the other draftanimals bolted
and dragged the carriage away, pursued on foot by the native driver, and
taking the other Malachanian, Dr Surlibob, now the only passenger aboard, on
what he later described as an entertaining tour. (It can't have been all that
entertaining, because I heard that when the runaway carriage returned
driverless to the Institute stable, Dr Surlibob was discovered curled up
and still squeaking hoarsely under the seat, his fur matted and soiled,
and totally unable to give any clear
account of events.)
 
Once the rattling of the carriage, and the cries of
the driver and Dr Surlibob's squeals had abated, here we were, members
of three different species, fellow scientists, but not close friends,
marooned in the barren wilds of a lightly inhabited planet together, and
no-one's wristphone could get a signal this far from the Institute's
antenna, which was only really intended for comms within the sprawling Institute itself.. 

I was the first to state the obvious: "It is becoming so dark that we
don't dare to wander far, the temperature is plummeting, and the hail is
enlarging. We must shelter." 

"We should go to the caldera, it's warm there," suggested Dr Rastus.

"Oh, but I may fall asleep," said Dr Jumjum.

"Is that all that'll happen to you?" asked Dr Rastus.

"Oh, yes, it won't poison me. It's just something we do if our offspring
can't sleep. We exude a little H<sub>2</sub>S, and off they go. A simple prod will
awaken me again."

"No matter, then," said Dr Rastus, "We'll waken you if necessary."

So we just clustered in the lee of the volcanic blowhole for warmth,
most of the hail now missing us or melting to rain as it passed over the
crater. Dr Jumjum was still wary of the gases, but she came closer, and
stood on Dr Rastus's tail by mistake and there was more squealing while
we tried to figure out in the half dark which of her feet was at fault. She
had deployed five pseudopoda at the time and she was pretty bulky, so it must
have hurt.

We reassured each other that we were not worried. The Institute would
send out a helicopter when we didn't return. There were no predators in
this area, and the weather seemed to be improving slightly.

Sure enough, Dr Jumjum fell asleep very quickly, all her extrusions -
eye stalks, legs, tentacles - subsided into her bulk, and she became a
vast pink rubbery cushion. Dr Rastus leaned against her, and I
eventually fell asleep listening to his regrettably porcine snores.

The sun was well above the horizon when I awoke, aching, but unharmed,
to the whack of helicopter blades. Dr Jumjum was still fast asleep,
still looking like a large squashed sphere. It took more than a 'simple poke'
to rouse her. I finally had to deliver a serious punch before she popped
out an eye, popped in a mouth, and said, "Good morning, dear. That was a
nice nap. And I had a lovely dream."

There was no sign of Dr Rastus. I assumed he had awakened early and gone
to look for Dr Surlibob and the carriage, so when the helicopter landed
and Dr Jumjum and I were gathered up, I asked the rather sour-faced Rescue captain to
have a look for him.

He grumbled: "The carriage came back to the stable late last night.
No-one knew you were lost till the driver finally got in. He'd walked twenty kilometers in the dark.
We scrambled
before dawn, but we couldn't distinguish your infra red signature against that crater you
were sleeping on. We've been searching around for hours till it got
light and we could see you, but we haven't seen anyone else strolling
about. Not on infra red or visual. He may have gone into a cave. There are
a lot around here."

We were deposited back at the Institute, rather under a cloud at having
caused so much trouble, though Dr Jumjum kept saying "It was hardly our
fault, dear, it was that draftanimal." 

More worrying was the fact that Dr Rastus never turned up, despite an
extensive ground and air search. After a week, the search was abandoned.
The general consensus was that Dr Rastus had probably fallen into the
caldera in the dark, and been reduced to smoke in seconds.

Dr Jumjum seemed to take it very badly. She stayed in her room for days
and didn't even emerge at mealtimes. This was something of a relief,
because the Faloon method of eating is to slap a plateful of food
against any vacant area of their skin, whereupon the skin under the
plate cavitates (it's called, rather unattractively, 'invagination'), 
the food disappears into the orifice with the help of some temporary
pseudopoda and the skin
re-forms over the cavity. Most diners, however weird their own
eating habits, found Dr Jumjum's presence at dinner rather unpleasant.

One morning, though, I received a message to visit her in her room. As
soon as I saw her, I knew she was very distressed. Her shape was lumpy,
and the skin greenish in hue.

"Oh, my dear, thank you for coming," she said.

"Not at all. I can see you are distressed. How can I help?"

"Well, I hardly know how to tell you. And I'm not at all sure. I may
have been responsible for Dr Rastus's disappearance."

"What's on your mind? You don't think you pushed him into that crater,
do you? He'd have squealed, and I'd have wakened up."

"No, not that. I've put on weight."

"Grief can do that," I said, though the opposite is more usually the case.

"And I'm excreting hairballs."

"Ah... Perhaps you're unwell."

She gazed at me with several eyes on tremulous stalks, desperate eyes with
lush eyelashes. I had never noticed how attractive her eyes were. They 
reminded me of someone. 

Dr Jumjum moaned quietly. "You don't understand. Dr Rastus was leaning on me when I fell asleep. I think
I may have eaten him by mistake."
