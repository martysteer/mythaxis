<p><em>Another flash piece focusing on the past, but without brain-housing robots this one is much less spectacular in scope - at least on the surface. How much here is truth, and how much fiction?</em></p>

<p>You know the feeling when you get a parking ticket that you don’t deserve? Should you fight it, or just pay it?</p>
<p>I’ll never forget one I got back in 1979. This ticket was so unfair that I went out and bought a cheap camera, took pictures, brought them into court, and got the satisfaction of having the ticket dismissed.</p>
<p>But what should I do with the camera? I had absolutely no interest in photography, but I decided one spring evening to take pictures of the sunset from the Brooklyn Heights promenade.</p>
<p>When I got there, the sun had just begun to sink behind the Jersey Meadowlands and the sky was a deep orange. And so, along with perhaps another dozen <em>real</em> photographers -- all with fancy cameras – I snapped away.</p>
<p>As the sun sank, the sky began taking on hues of purple. I included two or three people who leaned over the promenade railing, watching the sun almost imperceptibly slipping below the horizon.</p>
<p>I hoped that each of my photos would be at least a bit different from the previous one. Sometimes a spectator shifted, or was replaced by another. I moved along, a few feet from the railing, slowly changing my perspective.</p>
<p>Minutes after the sun had set, I was well into my second roll of film. I kept shooting, until maybe half an hour later, I had come to the end of the roll.</p>
<p>I hoped that I might have gotten a few good photos, but I wouldn’t know until I had the film developed. When I got back the snapshots, I had to admit that they were not half bad. So, I bought a small album and filled it with my sunsets.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I hosted a small get-together and one of my friends picked up the album and then passed it around. Everyone liked the pictures. Then a woman who came with one of my friends asked if I’d like to join her co-op photography gallery.</p>
<p>I thought she was joking, but she insisted that my photos would definitely sell. If I chipped in just a hundred fifty dollars a month, they could hang there for as long as I wanted.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was some kind of scam, but my friend vouched for her. The next day, I visited the gallery, which was just a narrow space on Atlantic Avenue down the block from some Syrian restaurants.</p>
<p>There were a few dozen photos hanging, none of which impressed me. But what did <em>I</em> know? I had a creepy feeling that I was being taken for a ride, but a hundred fifty bucks was all I was paying for a parking space.</p>
<p>A week later the gallery held an opening for my work. I had made multiple eight-and-a-half by eleven copies of each photo, mounted and ready to go at twenty-five dollars a pop. I was pretty sure that I was charging too much, but twenty-five was the minimum that any of the other photographers charged.</p>
<p>I was amazed when the second customer who looked at my photos bought one of them. Ten minute later, someone else bought two more.</p>
<p>In just two days I had almost sold out. I quickly had more copies made, and even got a nice review in <em>The Heights Press</em>. Then I doubled my prices, and my sales actually increased. The more I charged, the more I sold.</p>
<p>After a month, I was charging two hundred dollars for my photos and <em>still</em> selling out every weekend. Some of the other photographers were getting jealous of my success, even though the crowds I brought in bought some of <em>their</em> photos too.</p>
<p>I knew that each of them had a lot more talent than I did. I decided that I would never take another photo. I was clearly a fraud.</p>
<p>It would be much, much better for me to quit while I was ahead, rather than be discovered for what I really was. Surely the other photographers had my number, and maybe even were looking forward to witnessing my fall.</p>
<p>So I announced my retirement. The woman who had persuaded me to join the gallery asked me to at least continue to exhibit the photos I had shot that spring evening. “If you never take another photo, your place in the world of photography is secure. I wish you would change your mind, but either way, I will support your decision.”</p>
<p>Quickly, word spread. Dozens of newspaper columnists and even writers of letters to the editor begged me to reconsider. But I stuck to my guns.</p>
<p>By now my photos were fetching one thousand dollars. I had more money than I would ever be able to spend. But something about this whole chain of events was bothering me. I fell asleep each night trying to figure out what it might be.</p>
<p>And then, one morning I jumped out of bed and found the photos I had taken of my ticketed car. I could make out the writing on the ticket and the lettering on the sign next to my car.</p>
<p>Something didn’t jibe. And then, there it <em>was</em>! I realized immediately what a fraud I had been! I quickly dressed, and hurried to traffic court with the photos and ticket.</p>
<p>When I got to see a referee and told her what had happened, she could not stop laughing. “You are the first person I have ever met who wanted to enter a guilty plea after having been found innocent.</p>
<p>“And the fact that you had not realized your error – and <em>ours</em> – until months later, and <em>still</em> made the trip down here. Well, I don’t think that has ever happened in the entire history of the Department of Motor Vehicles!”</p>
<p>Then I noticed my photo hanging on the wall of her office. She saw me looking at it, and then glanced at the name on the ticket.</p>
<p><span id="_gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span>She smiled. “I’ll tell you what: Autograph the photo and we’ll call it even.”</p>
