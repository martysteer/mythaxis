[*BLURB] <b>Life is filled with little surprises.</b>
 
[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>There was no up, no down, no sideways. I
was on the ground, in the air, under water. A kaleidoscope of sight and
sound. Audio-visual bedlam, big screen, guaranteed front-row seat.</p>

<p>The hit from a neural disruptor is like deleting the master index to
your memory. Everything is out of context; there’s no timeline, no sense
of immediacy, no perspective. It lasted a few seconds, a year, or
somewhere in-between.</p>

<p><i>Blink.</i></p>

<p>I was sitting on the ground, my back against a landing strut.
It was a lush, green landscape with long shadows. Late
afternoon. A woman stood a short distance away, looking out at
the crops beyond the line of an irrigation canal. Apart from
that, there was no sign of civilisation.</p>

<p>Diana Ostov.</p>

<p>She was a heavy-ass brunette in her mid-twenties, handsome
rather than pretty. An entirely sexist and superficial
appreciation I admit, but my forebrain was still getting its act
together and, well, she ticked all the boxes.</p>

<p>I found my voice. “Where are we?”</p>

<p>She didn’t look in my direction. “Permian Major, apparently.”</p>

<p>I tried to place it and failed. “Ah, which system?”</p>
	    
<p>“The Canids Cluster.”</p>

<p>Still nothing. “Why? What are we doing here?”</p>

<p>A male voice. “That would be my idea, bud.”</p>

<p>I turned my head. A man was walking down the access ramp from the
ship. He carried a pistol, but casually; more as a Rim mercenary fashion
accessory than naked threat. His name was Bloon. He was a pilot, this
was his ship. I’d hired him. </p>

<p>I move people from place to place. People who don’t want to go
through formal channels. People like Diana Ostov. The Primacy was a
closed society, one of those who knew they were right and the rest of
the universe was wrong. All those who worked at the isolated starport
were morally suspect, if only by association. </p>

<p>Diana wanted out and had sufficient funds to make my involvement
worthwhile. It helps that I’m an empath, officially a strong Level Two.
In reality I’m an unregistered Three, capable of twisting perspective in
others without the need for a broadcast unit. So I’d walked her to the
ship while starport security ignored us; easy in, easy out. </p>

<p>A simple plan, executed cleanly, with no complications – until
now.</p> 
		 
<p>Bloon gestured with his gun. “Before you even think about trying any
mind-games, Klein, have a feel at the back of your head. Slowly,
now.”</p>
		 
<p>I did as he suggested, slowly. There was a hemispherical metal disk
stuck to my skull.</p>
		 
<p>The pilot squatted down beside me. “That there is a shaped charge
with an anti-handling trigger. It’s also linked to my EEG monitor and
biometric feed. Meaning that if I flatline or my vitals tank then that
tricksy brain of yours gets blown out your eye sockets. We understand
each other?”</p>
		 
<p>I nodded. Slowly. “Absolutely.”</p>
		 
<p>He grinned. “Outstanding. Now, me and the girl will be leaving in due
course. Don’t do anything stupid and you get to wave us good-bye.”</p>
		 
<p>“What, you <i>really</i> think the Primacy will pay for her return?
Wise-up, man, they’ll burn you alive as a heretic and dismember her as
irredeemably contaminated.”</p>
		 
<p>Bloon laughed. “Take her back? Hell, no. Diana has corporate
value.”</p>
		 
<p>I frowned. “You jazzed or something? She was born there and this is
her first time off-world. How can she be worth anything to anyone? No
offence, Diana.” </p>
		 
<p>The pilot stood up. “I ran her DNA as soon as she came aboard. Turns
out she’s the daughter of one Joseph Ostov, a corporate defector. He was
an indentured geneticist with HanaMed back in the day, one of their
brightest stars, until he vanished without trace.”</p>
		 
<p>“My father? You’re looking for my father?” Diana stepped closer, “But
he died, almost five years ago.”</p>
		 
<p>“There goes your leverage, Bloon.” I got to my feet and dusted myself
down, “Busted flush.”</p>
		 
<p>Bloon shook his head. “You weren’t listening. As an <i>indentured</i>
employee that means everything he produced is the property of HanaMed
Industries. Including the little lady here.”</p>
		 
<p>Diana sounded more confused than angry. “I’m not an object that my
father <i>produced</i>. I’m not just something that can be
<i>owned</i>.”</p>
		 
<p>Bloon winked at her. “Sure you are. Almost a third of the population
out on the Rim are obligated to some power or another. Oh, we don’t call
it slavery these days but it amounts to the same thing. I have a broker
sounding out HanaMed right now to see if you’re worth nixing my
agreement with Klein.”</p>
		 
<p>I really didn’t like the implications of that. “And if they don’t
bite, then what?”</p>
		 
<p>“Then we go back to Plan ‘A’. I drop you both off at Nebula Gateway
and you pay me the half-later part of our contract.”</p>
		 
<p>“Just like that? No hard feelings?”</p>
		 
<p>He shrugged. “It’s only business. Now, play nice and this will soon
be over.” Bloon holstered his gun and ambled away, towards the
canal.</p>
		 
<p>Diana and I looked at each other. I wiped my mouth. “Did your father
continue his work after he joined the Primacy? Did he experiment on you
at all?”</p>
		 
<p>She shivered. “No, no, nothing like that. He was a pharmacist,
dealing with locally produced remedies. There was maybe one odd thing,
now I come to think of it.”</p>
		 
<p>“Uh-huh?”</p>
		 
<p>“He called me his greatest creation, for as long as I can remember. I
always assumed it was just a figure of speech, a term of endearment, but
now…” Her voice trailed away and I could see concern in her grey
eyes.</p>
		 
<p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. “OK, so Papa Orlov is on
the run and needs a place to hide. But the Primacy are based on
religious eugenics, they wouldn’t accept an outsider unless his genetic
makeup was perfect, I mean flawless. It can’t just be a happy
coincidence…”</p>
		 
<p>“Well, I was tested at birth, everyone is. My mother was just a Beta
but I’m rated an Alpha.” She couldn’t hide the pride in her voice. </p>
		 
<p>“Forget tinkering with gene therapy. I think your father not only
found a way to wipe the slate clean, he passed that ability on as an
inherited trait.” A sudden thought made me frown, “Shit, how did he
die?”</p>
		 
<p>She stiffened. “What? Ah, he was helping a neighbour cut down a tree
and it fell the wrong way, crushing them both. Why is that
important?”</p>
		 
<p>“Sorry, but an accidental death is just fine. Something like cancer
or liver disease would blow my theory out of the water.” I ran fingers
across my stubble, “But if Bloon has forwarded your DNA to HanaMed for
confirmation, then we’re screwed. You’ll become a glorified lab-rat
while
I end up as landfill.”</p>
		 
<p>“Dead? But he said if you didn’t cause trouble then you’d be left
here, unharmed.”</p>
		 
<p>“Yeah, right. Someone like Bloon can’t screw a client and leave them
looking for payback. No, if this goes bad then it goes bad
big-time.”</p>
		 
<p>Diane stared at me for a long moment, chewing her bottom lip in an
incredibly fetching fashion. I never mix business with pleasure but in a
different time and place – who knows?</p>

<p>She frowned. “You’re an empath. Are you sure you
can’t tweak
him,
just a little? If HanaMed <i>do</i> offer to pay, then I'm guessing they
won't offer much, in case Bloon thinks I might be worth even more and
tries to sell me on the open market. Can’t you make him suspicious of
HanaMed's intentions, even paranoid, so that he goes for your agreed
pay-off instead?”</p>
		 
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. “Normally, yes, I could make him my best
friend forever, or at least until everything was done and dusted.
However, as things stand…” I gestured towards the back of my head, “… he
<i>could</i> be bluffing, but I’m not exactly keen to find out.”</p>
		 
<p>For a moment her whole demeanour changed, like she’d been keeping
No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy bottled up until he’d <i>really</i> had enough. The
look in her eyes was enough to shrivel any amorous thoughts I might have
been harbouring. Not just figuratively.</p>
		 
<p>She tossed her hair back. “I have a way out of this. Do you trust
me?”</p> 
		 
<p>“Depends. Does it involve me going <i> mano a mano</i> with Bloon
while you
cheer from the side-lines?”</p>
		 
<p>“You won’t even have to lift a finger.”</p>
		 
<p>I managed a semi-rakish grin. “Then count me in. What’s the
plan?”</p>
		 
<p>“Just go over and talk to him. Appeal to his better nature.”</p>
		 
<p>“Huh?”</p>
		 
<p>“Humour me, I think you’ll be surprised at the outcome.”</p>
		 
<p>I put on as much swagger as I could muster, given the circumstances,
and headed over to where the pilot was standing, gazing down at the
irrigation canal. Diana kept pace close behind me. Bloon was a big man
and I really didn’t fancy my chances if this ended in a fight, despite
her assurances.</p>
		 
<p>He turned to face me. “I haven’t heard anything as yet, so try and
chill out.”</p>
		 
<p>Diana touched the back of my neck. </p>
		 
<p>My balls felt like a cold hand had just cupped them, making me
gasp.</p>
		 
<p>The world snapped shut and opened again.</p>
		 
<p>I dropped maybe 15 centimetres and stumbled.</p>
		 
<p>There was a small explosion behind me; a flat bang with no echo.</p>
		 
<p>I fell, sprawling on long, coarse grass. </p>
		 
<p>I was naked.</p>
		 
<p>The rational part of my brain took a time-out so the instinctive me
bounced back up and stared around, trying to make sense of things.</p>
		 
<p>Bloon toppled backwards into the canal, his upper torso a bloody
mass. I was on the opposite bank from where I’d been standing only
moments ago – over 10 metres away.</p>
		 
<p>Diana raised her voice. “You make it OK?”</p>
		 
<p>I covered my groin with both hands. “Yeah, well…” I took a deep
breath. “What the hell just happened? The simple version!”</p>
		 
<p>“My father dubbed it ‘displacement’. However it only affects organic
matter, not your clothes – or Bloon’s shaped charge.”</p>
		 
<p>“Inbuilt teleportation? Jesus - but how the hell did you get that
past the ship’s scanners? Or generate enough energy?”</p>
		 
<p>“Teleportation? No, nothing so crude. Every planet is awash in dark
energy that most man-made systems can’t detect. I simply displaced your
molecular make up and background wash carried you across the canal in
the time taken for the effect to wear off.”</p>
		 
<p>Her matter-of-fact tone was more disturbing than a crazed rant. “Uh,
don’t take this the wrong way, Diana, but what the <i>fuck</i> are you
on about? Some magical power whisked me to safety, leaving Bloon to get
his face blown off? What’s next, we escape on the back of a bejewelled
star dragon? Because without a pilot that ship is going nowhere.”</p>
		 
<p>She laughed. “Then how about neural control of sticky neutrinos,
Klein, does <i>that</i> make more sense? Bloon scanned for electronic
implants, not bio-electrical signatures or organic abnormalities. My
body is a living powerhouse capable of dark matter manipulation. I could
probably run that entire ship of his without breaking sweat.”</p>
		 
<p>“Jesus, girl, do you have any idea what that kind of technology is
worth? Look, I know people - patent lawyers, private security, corporate
brokers – who can put together a primo deal. Cast iron, one that even
the Devil himself couldn’t dent.”</p>
		 
<p>“For a percentage, of course? You sound just like my father, except
the deal would be his and I’d just be his proof of concept. All he was
waiting for was my new organs to mature fully.” The bitterness in her
voice was obvious.</p>
		 
<p>I experienced a sudden moment of clarity. “You murdered him.”</p>
		 
<p>“I placed my hand on the tree trunk and it fell as I wished.
Although,
good luck explaining that to a Magistrate.”</p>
		 
<p>“Not a chance - your business is your business.” I looked to left and
right. The waterway stretched away in both directions with no visible
crossing point. “OK, so how do I get back across?”</p>
		 
<p>She smiled. “You don’t.”</p>
		 
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
		 
<p>“Sorry, Klein, but you’re on your own from now on.”</p>
		 
<p>“Look, Diana, without the ship I think we’d stand a far better chance
of getting off this world if we stick together.”</p>
		 
<p>“Actually, no.”</p>
		 
<p>I blinked. “No?”</p>
		 
<p>“I can fly the Delta, or at least let it fly itself. All I have to do
is sit back and enjoy the ride.”</p>
		 
<p>I tried not to sound relieved. “Ah, sorry to point out the obvious,
but the ship is in lock-down. The controls are keyed to Bloon’s
bio-signature, and his alone.”</p>
		 
<p>Diana shook her head. “I screwed the hired help while you were
unconscious. He even enjoyed having his back clawed while I harvested
sufficient skin cells to coat my right palm.” She smiled. “So, no, I
don’t believe the geno-lock will pose a problem.”</p>
		 
<p>“But you can’t just leave me here like this!” It was hard not to
whine.</p>
		 
<p>“Why not? It was Bloon I wanted out of the way and your survival was
just a by-product. Displacement timing is more art than science and you
could just as easily have ended up in the canal.”</p>
		 
<p>“You need me, Diana. You don’t know Rim society, you don’t know how
to survive out here.” </p>
		 
<p>“Oh, your contacts aboard Nebula Gateway would make life easier, I
admit, but I’ll get by. So long, Klein. Don’t come looking for me.” She
turned on her heel and strode away, up the access ramp and into the
ship. I tried to reach out but my brain was still on the fritz and her
mind was a like a smooth ball-bearing; cold and impenetrable.</p>
		 
<p>The access ramp swung shut and the engines began to power up. The
Delta used VTOL technology rather than an anti-grav lifting field. It
rose slowly into the air, down-blast blowing my abandoned clothes into
the water where they sank without trace. The landing struts retracted as
the ship moved forward, gaining speed. Part of me still hoped that Diana
would circle around and set down on my side of the canal, a big ‘Gotcha’
grin on her face as she welcomed me aboard.</p>
		 
<p>The nose lifted and the Delta accelerated away into the clear blue
sky, rapidly dwindling to a speck, a pinpoint, a figment of my
imagination.</p>
		 
<p>I heard a faint sonic boom.</p>
		 
<p>A breeze rustled the grass, water gurgled in the canal, the sound of
my own breathing. No birdsong, no insects, no distant hum of machinery.
I shivered and wiped sweat from my brow, then started walking alongside
the canal. I figured I’d find a pump or sluice gates - something I could
shut down so that a repair team would be sent to investigate. Hell, I’d
settle for a drone as long as I could attract its attention. As plans go
it sucked but I was out of options. </p>
		 
<p>Sometimes life pisses on you and tells you its raining.</p>
		 
<p>I just wished I’d brought an umbrella.</p>

future?”</b><br> <small> Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time
</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><p>“We can see the ghosts, but they can’t
see us?” Manuel asked. The guide, a tall Argentine called Alvaro, had
already been shooting glances at Manuel during the tour. Now, he smiled
perfect teeth and said:</p>
	    
<p>“Oh, yes. They can see us.”</p>
	   
<p>“I’m glad I did my hair, then,” Manuel said, flicking his curls back,
relieved that Alvaro was taking the touch of camp the wrong way. Natalia
was in a bad mood, hadn’t wanted to take the <i>Past-times Walk</i>, and
was being more-catty-than-catwalk today.</p>
	   
<p>“Then why can’t we talk to them?” she suddenly demanded, but Alvaro
smiled at her in such a way that Manuel wondered if he’d misread
Alvaro’s
compass.</p>
	   
<p>“What you’re seeing is something that has already happened. The past.
All the people you see would be ghosts in our time because, sadly, with
the timescale involved, they’d all be dead. We’re not seeing dead
people, though. We’re seeing images that have already happened. Done,
dusted, over. Hence we can’t interact with them.”</p>
	   
<p>“But you said they could see us,” Natalia insisted.</p>
	   
<p>“As ghosts, right. We’re like Scrooge’s last visitor. The ghosts of
things to come. But because we can’t change what’s already happened, we
can’t do anything but observe. We can’t interact.”</p>
	   
<p>“What if I wrote down a message now, held it up, and then came back a
week later… Surely the person would have seen the message and then they
would have time to respond to it.”</p>
	   
<p>“No.” Alvaro laughed and Manuel resented both the amount of time
Natalia was monopolising the guide and the fact that her tail was up and
she was in for a stubborn fight to prove she was right, ruining his own
chances with the guide when they got back to their own time.</p>
	   
<p>“Why not?”</p>
	   
<p>“Because we’re not able to change what happens, merely observe
it.”</p>
	   
<p>“But they are.”</p>
	   
<p>“Unfortunately not. Although they see us, they can’t respond--because
they didn’t the first time around…when we weren’t there.”</p>
	   
<p>“But that would mean…” Natalia was scratching her head, oblivious of
all the other members of the tour group who just wanted to see the 2010
World Cup they’d come to visit, when Spain would win its first final.
“Well, that it’s actually the <i>future</i> that can’t be changed. I
mean, they can’t change what they’re going to do even though we show
them means that it’s not the<i> past</i> that’s static—it can’t be,
because we’re here, we’re in it and you said we weren’t before—but the
<i>future</i>.</p>
	   
<p>“That would also be the reason why we can return to the point in time
when we left, but not travel any further into the future.”</p>
	   
<p>Natalia was furious about something as she glared at the guide.
Alvaro nodded for the rest of their party to go on ahead and join those
already filtering into Johannesburg’s Soccer City stadium.</p>
	   
<p>“You’re telling me my future is set and there’s nothing I can do
about changing it?” Natalia asked him. “That I can’t even <i>see</i>
what’s happening? Well, unless a future time traveller comes back and
holds up a sign or picture of how things turned out. And even then all I
can do is sit tight, teeth gritted, and let my future just happen?”</p>
	   
<p>“Nati,” Manuel said, putting a hand on her wrist. It was cold, damp,
the muscle beneath tight as wet stone, and she yanked it away. “You’re
telling me I can’t stop anything from happening that’s already happened
to my future self?”</p>
	   
<p>“That’s kind of right,” Alvaro said. “Because future is a perception
and not a reality, your future is only future as far as you’re
concerned. For those looking back, who lived after you, your future is
their past.”</p>
	   
<p>“And they’ve already happened?”</p>
	   
<p>“Everything has already happened. Everything that will ever happen,
has happened. Put simply: we reached the end.”</p>
	   
<p>Manuel felt a shiver run down his spine. “You mean I’m dead? We’re
all dead?” he asked.</p>
	   
<p>“I mean that the moment time travel became possible was because time
itself became a meaningless concept. It was passive. Like a dead snake
that will no longer rear up and bite you if you poke it in different
places along its body. It finally allowed two contradicting concepts:
the past cannot be changed, and the theoretical possibility of time
travel. This is the only way both are compatible.”</p>
	   
<p>“When there is no future left to disrupt…” Natalia said.</p>
	   
<p>“I’m <i>dead?</i>” Manuel repeated.</p>
	   
<p>“We all die, Mani!” Natalia snapped. “Just get over it!”</p>
	   
<p>It was his time to round on her, though. Best friend or not, there
was a cute guide to consider and, anyway, his emotions were as important
as hers.</p>
	   
<p>“We-ell, sor-ry, Señorita Perfectita! I don’t know who’s chewed a
chunk out of your ass today, but you’re being a total bitch.”</p>
	   
<p>“I saw a ghost before we left. Visiting me. My daughter.”</p>
	   
<p>“Your <i>daughter?</i>” Manuel asked, running round in front of her
and giving both her arms a squeeze. “Well, get you, Mamita!”</p>
	   
<p>“She showed me a message telling me I was going to die giving birth
to her.”</p>
	   
<p>“Oh…” Manuel turned the arm squeeze into a hug, for the first time
forgetting about Alvaro, who watched them with sympathetic detachment.
As Natalia’s shoulders hitched up and fell several times, Manuel pushed
her away and lined up his eyes with hers. “Ignore the guide, he doesn’t
know everything.” </p>
	   
<p>But Natalia raked her sleeve over her nose. “He will. He’s the
father.”</p>
	   
<p>The emotion that struck was inappropriate, selfish, outrageous--when
Manuel was able to calm himself after and think about how he’d reacted.
But it came before he was able to stop it.</p>
	   
<p>“Say <i>what?</i>” He looked between the two of them, Alvaro for the
first time losing his cool, pressing a finger to his chest and mouthing
<i>‘What, me?’</i></p>
	   
<p>“<i>One</i> of the fathers,” Natalia said through her sniffles.</p>
	   
<p>“How many do you <i>need</i>, girl?” Manuel said, hand on hip, not
yet losing his indignation.</p>
	   
<p>“Not me, my daughter. She needed two. You and Alvaro. You adopt her.
Well, when I say ‘adopt’, Alvaro was the biological father. He donated,
not impregnated.”</p>
	   
<p>Alvaro’s eyes were bulging as he stared,
mouth hanging open.</p>
	   
<p>Manuel didn’t know what to feel, nor precisely what he <i>was</i>
feeling.</p>
	   
<p>“She was beautiful,” Natalia said. “I wish I could see more of
her…”</p>
	   
<p>“Shush now, shush…” Manuel said.</p>
	   
<p>Alvaro cleared his throat. “Er…her father happens to work for the
leading Time-visits agency there is? So I predict she’ll be flying back
every evening…”</p>
	   
<p>Manuel smiled over Natalia’s shoulder at his future husband. “Not
till the little squirt’s done her homework,” he said.</p>
	   
<p>Natalia nodded, sniffling, finally—Manuel was pleased to see—using a
handkerchief rather than her sleeve.</p>
	   
<p>“You’d better do a good job, dopes. Or I’ll come back to haunt you.
Or forward. Or whatever it takes.”</p>
	   
<p>“Sure, Ghost-mama. Sure…” </p>
	   
<p>Arm in arm, the three walked towards the stadium where the vuvuzela
horns and screams of the crowd seemed to welcome their own moment of
triumphant resolution.</p>

<p class="drop">What is that bizarre contraption thrumming purposefully
northwards along Narpins Way, trailing wafts of hot copper, ripe peaches
and aging fish? </p>		

<p>It could only be Ruckney Plitter in his custom-built pre-SunCell
landshrinker, heading back to Snoak for the annual reunion with Ma
Wheggs. By pre-arrangement, on the first mutually convenient day in
Spring a half dozen of her former lodgers, all contemporaries, returned
for this celebratory event. It is unlikely that their respective paths
would ever have crossed if they had not chosen to come to Snoak City
from their scattered parental homes during those few formative years,
drawing strength from the happy accident of each other’s company as they
faced unknown vicissitudes at the start of their future careers. Most of
them had opted to stay in Snoak, and now had their own apartments.
Ruckney was one of the two exceptions.</p>

<p>The much cherished vehicle (referred to as ‘Ruckney’s rattletrap‘
only by the ignorant or envious), slowed to a raucous crawl as it
approached Slebb’s Junction, where he always found the signs confusing.
He passed the grounds of the old ParaPet works (now a fruit-juice
processing plant), ignoring the roadsign at Brandurp Street which
pointed west to Smatparrox, and noting the presence of another new
construction site. ‘<i>NEUTRILAX LETS</i> <b>YOU</b> <i>CHOOSE</i>!’
declared a portentously cryptic hoarding. To his left he recognized the
allotments bordering 20bird Lane, and beyond them the brightly-coloured
playground of the pre-school nursery, which meant that the turning after
next would be Welfage Road, leading to Park Street West and the familiar
blue-painted door of No.149 where Ma Wheggs used to brood over her
fledgling clutch of guests with something very close to maternal
concern.</p>

<p>On encountering the new severe parking restrictions in the inner
city, Ruckney found himself having to circle anticlockwise round the
entire perimeter of Garrible Park before finding an unoccupied place in
the designated area behind Praspafole Stadium. Watching the other
vehicles darting and gliding in and out of their neat spaces like
tropical fish, he supposed that in comparison his trusty shrinker was
more like a giant turtle: marginally noisier when in motion, he
conceded, but so much easier to find in a crowd than one of those
ubiquitous shiny toys, despite any vaunted advantages in terms of
economy. Extracting his pungent bags, he locked the shrinker and set off
on his unplanned walk to the sanctuary of No.149.</p>
					 
<p>As he turned the corner into Park Street West a rush of memories
jostled for precedence: his first arrival as a nervous young apprentice,
the time he and his new friend Sawly, flouting the house rules, had
smuggled back a bottle of wine wrapped in a towel, only for it to slip
and smash on the doorstep, or the occasion when one of the women from
next door (whom he had scarcely glimpsed until then) had once roused the
household well after midnight, seeking help to extricate a smouldering
mattress. The appearance of a pretty young woman in her nightclothes (to
Ruckney it was a beatific vision) was a definite stimulus to what he
smugly recalled was his unhesitatingly heroic assistance. Much later he
discovered (though not from Ma Wheggs) the actual nature of the house
next door, and the importance of functional and preferably
fire-resistant mattresses to the continued satisfaction of its
clientèle. </p>		 
					 
<p>The panel beside the doorbell was still reassuringly headed
<dim class=plate>WHEGGS</dim>. Below
this was a list of unfamiliar
names where his own and those of his contemporaries used to be, making
him feel momentarily as if he were trespassing, but the ripe odours
escaping from his bags reminded him he should probably ring the bell.
</p>				 
					 
<p>The door opened, and there she was: short, plump, benign, swathed in
the brightly festive printed silks she always wore for the annual
gathering, the straggling bun of hair perhaps a little greyer since his
last visit. As he gently disengaged from Ma Wheggs’ affectionate hug and
shrugged off his coat, the sound of lively voices confirmed that the
others had already arrived, all being relatively local, apart from
Sawly, who would have cruised downriver from his studio in Trevury in
his Slipshell Skimmer. Over Ma Wheggs’ head Ruckney saw that they had
assembled as usual in the big kitchen at the end of the corridor, past
the carpeted staircase leading up to the lodgers’ rooms. </p>
					 
<p>There were cries of “Here he is!”, “Hey, Ruckney!” and “It’s the
Shrinkerman!” as he approached the kitchen. Someone took his coat and
relieved him of his bags before he had a chance to open them, freeing
him for enthusiastic handshakes and claps on the back from Sawly Vext
and Strag Wilderfoot, and welcoming kisses on cheeks from Tebbi Nemming,
Yethne Farfyle and a third girl he did not at first recognize, until he
realized that the fiery sunset of hair must belong to the once shy young
woman he knew as Cendrel Pirch. </p>
					 
<div class=plate>PIRCH</div>
					 
<p class="drop">Platport was a quiet coastal community. Cendrel’s
parents were florists, supplying much of their stock from their own
garden and greenhouses. Their first child had died very suddenly from a
rare bacterial infection, barely a year old, and the loss continued to
haunt their lives, even after Cendrel’s advent. As she grew up there
were times when Cendrel felt almost stiflingly over-protected, and
others when some unexpected reminder of her parents’ lingering grief
would briefly cast a sullen cloud over otherwise normal activities. </p>
					 
<p>Cendrel was diffident about venturing into the shop, because it still
evoked an uncomfortable early memory of being terrified by a woman
shouting over the shrill yelps of her uncontrolled dog. She felt most at
ease outdoors among the plants, for which she felt a secret affinity. At
school she discovered that she had a flair for design, and later she
grew adept at the decorative side of the business; her floral
arrangements were instinctively balanced in terms of colour, scent and
composition, but she yearned for the freedom to be able to work on a
grander scale. Eventually she prevailed on her parents to let her apply
for the vocational course in landscape gardening offered by Sparagulan
College in association with the botanical gardens in Garrible Park. </p>
					 
<p>The euphoria of being accepted for the course was tempered by anxiety
about moving to Snoak City and having to cope with strangers. From the
accommodation list approved by the College, she selected the address
closest to the park, and in due course made the acquaintance of Ma
Wheggs, that least intimidating of landladies. Within a week of her
arrival the shy girl from Platport had been befriended by another
lodger, Tebbi Nemming, a sophisticated research assistant almost a year
her senior, who appointed herself Cendrel’s mentor, and in place of the
elder sister Cendrel had never known, set about fortifying the younger
girl’s self-confidence. </p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>“Trout, I expect. It’s still wrapped. And some furry
fruit. They seem
to have leaked a bit.”</p>
					 
<p>“Watch out for the cat. She’ll have that fish quicker than you can
say ‘Plitter!’ “</p> 
					 
<p>“Did someone call me?”</p>
					 
<p>‘It’s all right, Ruckers, we’re just unloading your gifts. How’s the
old shrinker, by the way?”</p>
					 
<p>“Perfectly fine, thanks. Had to leave it down by the Stadium, thanks
to the new pedestrian zones. By the way, anyone know what ‘Neutrilax’
is? I passed a big sign on the corner of Brandurp Street.”</p>
					 
<p>“I’m sure I’ve seen the name somewhere. Is it one of those skin-care
soaps?”</p>			 
					 
<p>“It sounds like something they use to quieten horses.”</p>
					 
<p>“Tebbi will know. Hey, Tebbi, what’s ‘Neutrilax’?”</p>
					 
<p>“No idea. It’s probably either a breakfast cereal or a contraceptive.
Unless it’s for treating acidity in the soil, in which case Cendrel’s
your expert, am I right, Cen?”</p>
					 
<p>“If it were something for the soil, yes. But it’s not, at least as
far as I know. I think it might be an industrial solvent.”</p>
					 
<p>From the doorway came a sound of chuckling, familiar to everyone
present. They turned to the silk-swathed source.</p>
					 
<p>“Do you know something we don’t, Ma Wheggs? asked Ruckney.</p>
					 
<p>“Oh, I certainly do, Mr Plitter. I know you all lead busy lives, but
if any of you boys and girls had been paying attention, you might have
heard about the competition.”</p>
					 
<p>The general murmur of interest was just sufficient to mask the sound
of a cat surreptitiously trying to unwrap a trout.</p>
					 
<p>“It’s a back-to-front advertising campaign,” explained Ma Wheggs. “It
started a few weeks ago, in the press and the other media, and there are
posters everywhere. The competition’s very simple: to describe in
exactly a hundred words the product that best matches the name
‘Neutrilax’. The winner can choose between either a fixed cash prize or
a guaranteed 5% stake in the profits from sales of the eventual
product.”</p>		 
					 
<p>Yethne was dismissive. “That’s a crazy idea! The product has to come
first. My class of ten-year olds could tell you that.” </p>
					 
<p>“Maybe it’s just crazy enough to work,” said Strag. “Some bored
entrepreneur with access to lots of facilities must be willing to take a
big risk. Probably old Quanderpyre. You used to work in the big pink
tower, Tebs. Did you ever meet him?”</p>
					 
<p>“Not once in the two years I was there, but I was only a humble
researcher on the fifteenth floor. I believe he spends most of his time
in the penthouse guarding his treasures.” </p>
					 
<p>“I’ve heard people saying Farras Grein might be behind it,” said Ma
Wheggs. “But no-one seems to know for sure.”</p>
					 
<p>“It’s certainly a novel way to make sure everyone knows the product
name, whatever it turns out to be, but for it to be successful it would
still have to be something that they actually need,” said Sawly.</p>
					 
<p>“Ah, but Sawl, surely you’re not saying that people buy only what
they need?”</p>		 
					 
<p>“Well no, of course not, Ruckers, I mean they’d have to be persuaded
it was something indispensable, such as...”</p>
					 
<p>“Twitching fish!” </p>
					 
<p>The sudden yell came from Tebbi, who was pointing at a spot on the
floor, where a large well-wrapped deceased trout, which only the day
before had been lurking quietly in a stream in Drether’s Wheen, was seen
to be edging its way under the table with a kind of jerky deliberation
that was quite hypnotic to watch. </p>
					 
<p>With surprising agility Ma Wheggs crossed the space from door to
table, and with a practiced motion that was almost balletic, scooped up
the offending cat and separated it from its inert prey as she headed for
the back door. “Husspert, you are a wilful rogue, and one day I’m going
to put you out for good and replace you with a phoelix… or even a
modifido,” they heard her telling it with her customary reproachful
fondness.</p>		 
					 
<div class=plate>NEMMING</div>
					 
<p class=drop>The Nemming household in Meheric was not a place for
meditation, or
even for taking a quick nap in the afternoon. Tebbi’s father was the
area representative for a firm making industrial lighting systems, and
when not travelling he enjoyed rigging up experimental test kits at
home. There were very few dark corners. Her mother was a part-time
teacher with a passion for making decorative pots, which she prepared in
the basement workroom (brighter than the average), and fired in the kiln
she had constructed in the back garden. </p>
					 
<p>Harlio and Twace, Tebbi’s older brothers, were sports-oriented. They
owned balls of various textures, dimensions and degrees of elasticity,
together with a selection of striking implements. Their target ranges
for projectiles outgrew the confines of their pockmarked bedrooms. They
would disappear for hours on their racing twindles. They ran, swam,
wrestled, leaped, glided and generally exercised their sinewy limbs.
Tebbi, whose principal status had been as their favourite toy, tolerated
their doting and teasing until she grew old enough to become a
participant on her own terms. Although they remained faster and
stronger, her co-ordination and stamina were better than theirs, which
gratifyingly earned her their respect. </p>
					 
<p>While her brothers continued to pursue their sporting interests Tebbi
completed her formal schooling, returned for an evening course on data
management, and then tried to decide what she really wanted to do. She
had harboured ambitions to be a dancer, a deep-sea diver, a forensic
psychologist and a fashion model, but came to realize that these were
probably mutually incompatible careers. She told herself to be
practical, knowing she needed to broaden her horizons, and started
looking for job opportunities outside Meheric. Quanderpyre Investments
were seeking ‘smart young research assistants’, and offered in-work
training as well as a generous starting salary. If accepted, she would
need to find somewhere to stay among the bright lights of Snoak. The
prospect of life in the big city was both daunting and enticing. Come to
think of it, the lights might not be as bright as those at home, but she
was sure she would adapt.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>The custom on these occasions was for each of the guests
to bring dishes of food, both savoury and sweet, requiring a minimal
amount of cooking, although, if necessary, reheating or chilling were
permissible. Those with little or no culinary skills (such as Ruckney
Plitter) were excused from advance preparation. It was agreed that Ma
Wheggs should not involve herself in any further cooking process.
However, in deference to her territorial rights and experience, she
would be allowed to offer supervisory advice. </p>
					 
<p>Ma Wheggs always insisted on providing both a basket of fresh bread
and a welcome jugful of chilled emberskelven (the old house rules being
in abeyance), which, as it was deftly replenished, seemed to go well
with whatever unforeseen combination of dishes chanced to arrive, and
undoubtedly enhanced the air of celebration. </p>
					 
<p>The surface of the table was gradually obscured by an appetising
array of foods in serving bowls, dishes and jugs: sliced meats,
casseroles, pastes, salads and cooked vegetables, pies, gravies and
dressings, supplemented by fresh fruit, pastries, trifles, sorbets and
other delicacies.</p>
					 
<p>Strag was enthusiastic. “This is really good! What’s in the sauce,
Yethne?” </p>		 
					 
<p>“Black Lattons cheese, with chives, pearl mushroom flakes and a hint
of lemon. It’s quite mild.”</p>
					 
<p>”It actually complements rescued trout very well.”</p>
					 
<p>A slightly indignant grunt issued from the trout supplier, whose
mouth was full. Yethne looked pleased.</p>
					 
<p>“Oh, Ruckers, that was meant as praise, for both of you. Your fishing
skills are legendary, Yethne makes exquisite sauces, and we all know
that Husspert is the craftiest cat in Snoak.” </p>
					 
<p>The second grunt had a mollified nuance. Ma Wheggs smiled, and raised
her glass, whereupon everyone did the same, and Strag proposed a toast
to the temporarily exiled cat.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>WILDERFOOT</div>
					 
<p class=drop>Strag Wilderfoot had run away from Horm. At least, that’s
what he
later told himself and others. As he imparted to his diary in his
eighteenth year, “I’ve sucked dry your thin suburban juices! I crave
richer sustenance, and will go to Snoak to seek fulfilment, friendship
and fortune!” He had friends in Horm, but they did not understand his
passion for actual printed books or his obsessive need to write. Strag
had begun three novels, each one abandoned after a few chapters.
Something vital was missing. It was not ability, or serious intent, or
imagination. Could it possibly be experience? </p>
					 
<p>He had suffered the agonies of unrequited love, having fallen for
Caris Selk, a long-haired blonde girl at school who thought he was
weird, an opinion unfortunately shared by his exhausted parents. He had
been a late child, and while they had managed his upbringing to the best
of their ability, they could no longer keep up with his energy or active
mind. They had presented him with the savings accrued in his name, told
him that Marla, his maternal grandmother was moving in, and within a
week had nudged him out of the house with tearful blessings in the
direction of Snoak City, the one place they had gleaned from his
frequent impassioned monologues where he really wanted to be.</p>
					 
<p>On arrival in Snoak, Strag refreshed himself at the airport and then
headed with nervous determination for what to him was a primary focus of
intellectual discernment. </p>
					 
<p>Pentheus Sprent was not in the habit of being rudely disturbed,
especially by a teenager, but this one had been unusually persistent,
and had talked his way past several of the staff, giving plausible
reasons for his presence. While this suggested that security needed
tightening, it did show considerable initiative. The boy had got as far
as the waiting room outside Sprent’s office, where he perched on the
edge of a sofa intended to induce relaxation. The screen set into
Sprent’s inner door revealed a flushed-looking, lanky, dark-haired lad.
His bulky glidecart still had an attached airpod label showing he had
set out from Horm. Sprent, long experienced in interpreting a client’s
state of mind from inadvertent signals, examined the boy’s features. His
expression flickered between anxious hope and injured innocence. Sprent
made his decision and pressed a button. “You can show the boy in,” he
told his receptionist. “Tell him it’s safe to leave the glidecart.”</p>
					 
<p>Sprent motioned him into a less voluptuous seat. Well, Mr …?”</p>
					 
<p>“Wilderfoot. Strag Wilderfoot, Mr Sprent. It’s a great pleasure to
meet you, sir.”</p>	 
					 
<p>“Perhaps so, but I am more interested to know why you have come to
see me in such a presumptuous manner without prior invitation.”</p>
					 
<p>“Of course. My apologies. You see, sir, my ambition is to become a
writer, and I need to be in an environment where such an aspiration is
not looked on as something abnormal, or frivolous. That is why I have
come to Snoak, and…”</p>
					 
<p>“You have come to Snoak from somewhere beyond the civilized
world?”</p>			 
					 
<p>“From Horm, sir. That’s where I grew up and went to school.” A trace
of chagrin was evident in Strag’s voice.</p>
					 
<p>“It’s irrational to be ashamed of one’s birthplace,” said Sprent,
“and to judge from your demeanour and vocabulary, you appear to have
benefited from your upbringing and education.“</p>
					 
<p>“It’s not that I’m ashamed, Mr Sprent, and I will never regret my
schooling. It’s just that I seem to have exhausted whatever Horm has to
offer, and I’m desperate to find a place where I can develop my talents.
That’s why I came here.”</p>
					 
<p>Sprent frowned. “Are you expecting me to offer you a job? Without a
formal application, without evidence of your specific attainments, and
in the palpable absence of previous working experience in the publishing
field?”</p>			 
					 
<p>Strag looked crestfallen. “I suppose I really didn’t know what to
expect, sir. In my mind the firm of Fissile and Sprent has always been,
well, a kind of fount of wisdom where I would find answers to my
questions. I’m afraid my only working experience has been as editor of
the school magazine, but the contributions were not exactly of a high
literary standard. I’m an avid reader, and I believe I can tell when a
piece of writing is flawed. But I’m sure I still have much to learn,” he
added hastily.</p>	 
					 
<p>“I appreciate your honesty, Mr Wilderfoot. In return I can tell you
that we are not conceited enough to regard ourselves as a fount of
wisdom, although as you clearly appreciate, we pride ourselves on the
quality of our books. My advice to you would be to take yourself down to
Sparagulan College, where you will find that for a small fee you could
sign up for a useful six-month introductory course in publishing, run by
Dirry Tradfern, an old friend of mine. Assuming you are willing to do
that, please make an appointment here when you have completed the
course, and depending on Tradfern’s assessment, you may well find there
will be an opening at Fissile and Sprent for an editorial assistant.”
Sprent regarded him benevolently from beneath his bushy grey
eyebrows.</p>		 
					 
<p>“That’s more than I could have hoped for, Mr Sprent.” Strag rose to
shake his hand. “I’m really grateful for your advice… and for bothering
to see me.”</p>		 
					 
<p>“The direct approach is sometimes the best,“ said Pentheus Sprent.
“But don’t tell anyone I said that. Where are you staying in Snoak?”</p>
					 
<p>“Oh, I haven’t looked for anywhere yet.”</p>
					 
<p>“Then this may save you a little time,” said Sprent, going to a
shelf, opening a file and extracting a leaflet. “We happen to publish
material for the College, including their approved accommodation list. I
seem to remember one of addresses is not far from here. Ah yes, there we
are. Park Street West. Name of Wheggs.”</p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>“… or a safety device for a sharp-edged tool?” Having
enjoyed a
second portion of Cendrel’s excellent trifle, Sawly’s mind had suddenly
drifted back to the earlier topic.</p>
					 
<p>“I can’t see that reaching a large enough market,” said Ruckney,
leaning back and lacing his fingers over his paunch. “No, in my opinion,
it would have to be something to relieve flatulence or indigestion. That
would be bound to have popular appeal, wouldn’t it?” He looked round for
support.</p>		 
					 
<p>“Probably not the ideal subject while we’re still eating, Mr
Plitter.”</p>		 
					 
<p>“Eh? Oh, sorry, sorry, Ma Wheggs.” Chastened, he sat back up and hung
his head glumly like a contrite child. </p>
					 
<p>“Tact was never your strong suit, Ruckers,” snorted Sawly, his own
tongue a little loosened by the strength of the emberskelven. </p>
					 
<p>Cendrel, by now also distinctly merrier, had tuned in fuzzily to the
conversation. She raised an index finger and wagged it knowingly. “But
he does have one. He told me!” </p>
					 
<p>“Has one what, dear?” enquired Ma Wheggs.</p>
					 
<p>Cendrel leaned towards her former landlady and confided in a dramatic
whisper: “A stroot!” She frowned and shook her head. “I mean suit. A
really, really strong suit! Made of coly… polycarbine fibles.” Satisfied
that she had correctly remembered the technical term, she beamed at
Ruckney, and was rewarded with a knowing wink.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>PLITTER</div>
					 
<p class=drop>He did indeed have a top-of-the-range protective suit, the
material
spun from synthetic polyamides developed during his third year with the
Advanced Fabrics team at Central’s research labs. Although the suit was
still officially the property of Central, as its sole wearer he had been
the favoured recipient for its long-term loan after large-scale
production of the final design had been approved for industrial and
scientific use, and advance orders received from, among others,
smelters, chemical factories, fire departments, hazardous waste handlers
and the odd vulcanologist. </p>

<p>Following his apprenticeship he had helped modify and improve the
automated processing machinery, and was one of the eager volunteers
selected to have a prototype suit fitted for practical testing. During
this experimental phase he had been obliged to respect a confidentiality
agreement not to discuss technical details outside the workplace. </p>

<p>The suit was lightweight, flexible, heat- and water-resistant, had
high tensile strength and was electrically non-conductive. Equipped with
matching gloves and face-shield Ruckney had walked through fire, been
exposed to splashes of molten glass and metal, languished in tanks of
various liquid compounds, and survived contact with high voltage sparks.
Relieved to have emerged unscathed from these trials, he was happy to
commend use of such suits by anyone working in extreme conditions, and
felt he had earned the opportunity to try his out in the (slightly) less
dangerous confines of the garage back home in Drether’s Wheen. It was
there that his precious landshrinker grew by increments over a two-year
period as he was able to obtain parts from scrapyards and specialist
dealers during holidays and occasional week-ends. </p>

<p>This landshrinker was not a thing of beauty, but had a
straightforward blunt practicality that reflected the character of its
owner. It was strong, capacious and solidly dependable, powered by a
quartet of Kjold inertial engines (formerly used to drive a freight
transporter), which could be independently engaged to provide either
backup redundancy or extra thrust when required. It was a vehicle
adapted for the freedom of travel across wind-scoured terrain with an
unobstructed view of the horizon, but so far had made only comparatively
short journeys into populated areas, and had yet to be properly
unleashed. Ruckney harboured plans for a long-distance trip when his
spell of work as a consultant engineer at Smode’s Extrusions (on the
outskirts of Drether’s Wheen) came to an end early the following year.
He’d been thinking of inviting Sawly to join him, if the man was willing
to be parted long enough from his skimmer.</p>

<div class=plate>VEXT</div>

<p class=drop>No-one would deny the fascination of fire, but as a boy
Sawly’s
curiosity with what could be made to burn resulted (understandably) in
anxious parental warnings and frequent checks for any fire-making
devices. Being resourceful, he maintained a couple of convenient outdoor
hiding-places, known only to trusted friends (behind a broken brick in
the stump of a wall, the ivy-screened hollow of a tree). Here were
stored flints, convex lenses, tufts of steel wool, candle stubs, thin
tubular objects gnarled by heat beyond the recognition of all save
fellow experimenters or forensic specialists. An enthusiastic science
teacher at school had inadvertently intensified Sawly’s interest in
chemistry by heralding a practical laboratory demonstration with phrases
such as “extreme caution”, “on no account”, and “never without adult
supervision”. Certain powdered substances had been combined, a simple
fuse attached, and ignited at arm’s length by a taper. Standing back at
a safe distance the class was treated to a fountain of sparks, a
spectacularly colourful explosion and a pall of satisfyingly acrid
smoke. Sawly had followed the preparations with unusual attention, and
found himself wondering whether chemistry might become more than a
hobby.</p>
		 
<p>Another significant epiphany occurred on a school visit to Snoak City
Museum, long before it acquired its international reputation with the
acquisition of the fabled Trox Bequest. He had no particular reverence
for very old things, be they stuffed dead animals, shards of pottery,
monumental statues or corroded weaponry, even when tastefully displayed
with helpful explanatory notes. He might have admitted to a vague
fascination with some of the unusual rocks and minerals, with their
strange crystalline growths or glittering facets, but what really opened
his mind that day was in the section devoted to glass. </p>
		 
<p>He had always taken glass objects for granted, without giving any
thought to their manufacture. Bottles, jars, bowls, glasses, ornaments,
windows, mirrors, bulbs, lenses: things in everyday use he had never
bothered to think much about until his attention was drawn to one
particular item in that museum; a slender round-shouldered translucent
vase on a plinth base. The surface was etched with fine tendril-like
striations which had the effect of refracting the light so that the vase
appeared both to glow and sparkle at the same time. Sawly remembered
staring at the vase, entranced, before glancing at the label which
detailed its probable history, concluding with a reminder that this
ancient craftsmanship, like all glass-making, depended on the ability to
fuse quartz. Quartz was something with which Sawly was familiar from the
annual family holiday in Platport. He had spent many idle hours on
Platport beach, exploring, excavating and building short-lived
labyrinths and palaces from the same raw material, the same gritty,
slithering grains which could be transformed with the addition of a few
chemical compounds and a little skill, he realized with dawning
amazement, into something as breathtaking as that vase. Without
question, this was the skill he wanted to learn.</p>
		 
<p>Snoak Glassworks took on very few new apprentices. Craft glassmaking
was a very specialized discipline, requiring good hand-eye
co-ordination, a sound understanding of the underlying science and a
strong aesthetic sense. However, the Vext lad had arrived with a
portfolio of designs, very favourable references from the art and
science teachers at his school in Trevury, along with a letter of
commendation from the head, saying that he had rarely known a pupil with
such determination, whose abilities so closely matched the career he
hoped to pursue. Morsyl Tammer, the chief designer, was grudgingly
impressed, and had agreed to offer Sawly a month’s trial, with a modest
advance to cover living expenses. He was confident that the tourist
bureau at Central would have details of suitable lodgings, which indeed
proved to be the case. </p>
		 
<div class=plate>149</div>
		 
<p class=drop>After the meal Ma Wheggs had ushered them out of the
kitchen, and
they had retired to what they used to call the floproom. It was
essentially an informal library, with shelving on three walls. To an
initial nucleus of well-loved books, many previous guests, for the most
part students and trainees, had contributed a book or two of their own
before leaving. Under house rules, it was expected that borrowed books
would eventually be returned, but there were no penalties for default.
The net result was that the library had become by increments both a
useful educational resource and a treasury of surprises. A manual on
knot-making might rub shoulders with a textbook on hydrostatics, a Seff
Haldergath spy thriller, or a book of verse by Oxwell Gimbloss. The
central oval table was the only unobscured item of furniture. Ma Wheggs
periodically enhanced the original seating with fresh batches of
decorative cushions, so that it was often a matter of guesswork as to
what lay beneath, but there was always somewhere comfortable to sprawl,
and usually something interesting to read. </p>
		 
<p>On the lower shelves were propped some small framed holos, nostalgic
reminders of departed predecessors waving and smiling. Higher up, and
therefore less accessible, were a few older Wheggs family holos. Yethne,
feeling slightly light-headed and emboldened, had removed her shoes and
scrambled up a hill of plump cushions to peer up at the one which
featured a tall young man gazing down at the upturned face of his
partner, who was smiling back at him. They were at some kind of outdoor
evening celebration. She reached up carefully and brought it down for a
closer look, thumbing the side panel to activate it. Somewhere just
off-screen a band was playing; she caught a partial glimpse of blue and
gold uniforms. Behind the couple people were dancing. In the distance,
fireworks bloomed and showered, briefly illuminating a segment of what
appeared to be the Stadium. Yethne clambered down with as much decorum
as possible, and held it out for the rest of them to see.</p>
		 
<p>They clustered round.</p>
		 
<p>“Wow! ’That looks like a young version of…”</p>
		 
<p>“Do you suppose…”</p>
		 
<p>“It’s not a version. That’s definitely Ma Wheggs, but she looks
so…”</p> 
		 
<p>“…so happy. And so does that rather good-looking fellow. Is
that…”</p>
		 
<p>“Of course! It must be Pa Wheggs. Before he…”</p>
		 
<p>“Before the accident.”</p>
		 
<p>“Accident? I didn’t know. What accident?”</p>
		 
<p>“The bloating accident. He was the official Troller. At Praspafole
Stadium. For ten years or more.”</p>
		 
<p>“I never knew that. How did I never know that? I often wondered what
became of him.”</p>
		 
<p>“Well, she doesn’t care to talk about it, even after all these years,
which is understandable.”</p>
		 
<p>“Do you know what happened?”</p>
		 
<p>“The pitch was rock-hard. It was late season, and the ground had
frozen overnight, but they wouldn’t think of cancelling a game. You know
how resilient bloat players are. The perimeter glider malfunctioned; it
accelerated unexpectedly, he was thrown off and landed head first.
Suffered severe concussion, despite his head-pad. In a coma for weeks,
but sadly never recovered.”</p>
		 
<p>“Oh, that’s awful. Poor chap. And poor Ma Wheggs!”</p>
		 
<p>“I think she would have received compensation, but imagine having to
deal with the loss…”</p>
		 
<p>“It must have been ghastly for her. How did you get her to tell
you?”</p>
		 
<p>“Actually I didn’t, but Fissile &amp; Sprent have an old-fashioned
datafile full of local news reports, and I chanced to spot the name
Wheggs in the index. </p>
		 
<p>“We’d better put the holo back.”</p>
		 
<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>
		 
<p>“Thanks, Ruckney. Shoes!”</p>
		 
<p>“What? Oh, yes.”</p>
		 
<div class=plate>FARFYLE</div>
		 
<p class=drop>Black Lattons had been home to the Farfyles for as long as
anyone
could remember. It was an agricultural community, and, if you were a
Farfyle, the answer to most problems ultimately lay in the nutrient-rich
soil, fed by the upper reaches of the Stirrow as it wound through the
sheltered valley. The farms were largely self-sufficient, and their
high-quality produce and traditional hand-made craftwork were readily
traded or sold for any required items not available locally. It was an
idyllic spot, where human activity was geared to the daily movement of
the sun and the largely predictable pattern of the seasons. The work was
hard but rewarding, and Yethne, like her great-uncle Grome before her,
could not wait to be somewhere else, where you were not woken at dawn by
the ear-piercing yells of a mad-eyed bird, or obliged to muck out
unending quantities of smelly animal droppings before most sensible
people had eaten their breakfast.</p>
	 
<p>According to family legend, as soon as he was of a suitable age,
great-uncle Grome, who was allergic to feathers, pollen, sawdust,
animals, straw, and it seems anything else remotely relating to
agriculture, who was also prone to insomnia and blessed (or afflicted)
with sensitive hearing, had made it quite clear that he had an
irresistible urge to experience a completely different environment. True
to his word, he embarked on an ocean-going vessel bound for the southern
seas, working his passage as a galley-hand, and ended up on a remote
island, where, as a surviving handful of his subsequent letters
testified, he became proficient at diving for shellfish, inventing
cocktails and occasionally helping out at the weather station.</p>
	 
<p>Yethne Farfyle was just as motivated, but less inclined to plunge
into the unknown. Other than farming, the only profession she had had
the opportunity to observe at all closely was teaching. Apart from the
irascible Mrs Nullark with her glass eye and uncanny ability to identify
miscreants, all her teachers had been kind, reasonably cheerful, patient
people, who had tried to instil in their charges a love of learning, or
at the very least a vague curiosity and a useful smattering of basic
skills. She rather fancied being a teacher. It would be just like
helping the tinies to tell the time, or explaining difficult words to
her friend Morette, except that she would be paid, and still have
holidays. </p>
	 
<p>After a little research she discovered that even teachers had to
spend some time learning how to teach properly, and that would mean her
having to go to somewhere like Trevury or Meheric, or the famous
Sparagulan College in Snoak. She had been to Snoak two or three times
when she was younger. Memories of the first visit were rather hazy. She
suspected she might have slept through the entire trip. The other two
visits had been birthday treats; one to see a stage show, with live
music and dancers in dazzling floaty costumes. The third occasion had
been on her twelfth birthday, when she was allowed to spend her own
money at Snoak City market. That had been very satisfying. The more she
thought about it, the more appealing was the idea of living in Snoak.
She would need to persuade her parents, but they knew she was old enough
to make up her own mind. She was not quite sure whether it would further
her cause to mention great-uncle Grome. </p>
	 
<div class=plate>149</div>
	 
<p class=drop>The atmosphere in the floproom was comfortably soporific.
Tebbi and
Cendrel, both currently unattached, were casually discussing the virtues
and deficiencies of past boyfriends. Strag and Yethne were engrossed in
a well-loved children’s book (‘The very small <b>SHOUTING</b> Box’).
Ruckney had drifted into a light doze while waiting for Sawly to make up
his mind about joining him on the proposed overland journey in the
landshrinker. Sawly, who also had his eyes shut, was thinking aloud.</p>
	 
<p>“…well, I’m building up a decent reserve stock of the best-selling
designs, like the perfume-bottles and paperweights, and towards the end
of the year I’ll be able to concentrate on special commissions. And the
skimmer’s been in good shape, since I fixed the leak. So by next Spring
I should have some free time for travel, although being stuck with each
other in your monster of a vehicle for any length of time might drive us
both loopy. Still, if you’re prepared to risk it, Ruckers…”</p>
	 
<p>Ruckney stirred. “Hmmph?”</p>
	 
<p>“The question is, do you really want to risk it?”</p>
	 
<p>“Nngh. Hrrrm. No thanks, I’m really full.”</p>
	 
<p>“Ruckers?”</p>
	 
<p>“Hm?”</p>
	 
<p>“What did I just ask you?”</p>
	 
<p>“Did I want a biscuit?”</p>
	 
<p>“Go back to sleep.”</p>
	 
<p>Ruckney yawned and checked the time on a fingernail display. “I’d
better not. I’ll need to be heading back shortly to avoid the commuter
traffic.” He reached into a pocket for his nultox and tongued a tab.
“Whatever did people do before we had these?”</p>
	 
<p>“Suffered from sore heads and stayed off the roads, I expect. Listen,
Ruckers, about that trip: it sounds like it might be fun. We’ve still
got plenty of time to discuss details, but I meant to ask you if you’d
done anything yet about noise dampening. I’ve fitted out the skimmer
with these really effective acoustic panels…”</p>
	 
<p class=drop>“Clage….? Wispy moustache and snorty laugh?” </p>
	 
<p>“Like a flustered goose? No, that would be ‘Foghorn’ Flade. Clage is
quieter, taller, better dressed, usually in muted colours. Dark hair,
blue eyes, slender hands…”</p>
	 
<p>“Is that Clage? He was at Guyl’s party in Yarp Street. I thought he
looked bewildered. Guyl had a deafening waterfall hoto playing, so there
was a bit of a sensory overload, and no chance of conversation.”</p>
	 
<p>“Guyl’s rather fun. Were you and he…”</p>
	 
<p>“No, Tebs, not really. Well, we had a mild flirtation, nothing
serious. Now what about you and Clage?”</p>
	 
<p>“Ah, that’s complicated…”</p>

<p class=drop>Strag turned the last page, their heads almost
touching.
	 
<blockquote><i>"And after that they rinsed it clean and
dabbed it
dry with a scrap of cloth the colour of the sky, and put it on a stout
cork mat. They listened very hard. The little box was as empty as ever,
and it was quite, quite silent. So they wrapped it up and took it back
to the place by the pool. Under the tree with the drooping boughs where
the brown bird sang its solitary song, they lifted the stone that hid
the hole where the box had lain for so very long. Into the ground, with
scrupulous care, they placed the little box, and hid the hole with the
heavy stone. As they made their way home a gust of wind blew a swirl of
leaves over the spot with a whispery sound.</i></p>
	 
<p><i>"Traveller, should you pass this way, and see that tree with its
drooping boughs and lone brown bird beside the pool, and find the stone
that hides the hole, take care! For if you hear, however faint, the
sound of shouting somewhere near, go very quickly from that place. But
if you stay, my friend, beware! Beware the dark enchantment in the
air."</i></p> </blockquote>
	 
<p>Strag closed the book, and Yethne wiped away a tear with the back of
her hand.</p>
	 
<p>“Such a strange ending.”</p>
	 
<p>“I know. But didn’t you always secretly want to find the box?”</p>
	 
<p>“Of course I did! Didn’t you?”</p>
	 
<p>“I used to slip down to Horm pond and poke about with a stick in the
hope of finding the right stone, but the ground was soggy, the trees
were the wrong kind, too far away, and home to squadrons of bad-tempered
crows.”</p>
	 
<p class=drop>Their wistful moment was interrupted by the re-appearance
of Ma
Wheggs, bearing a tray of small home-made confections in little bags
which she placed on the table for her guests to take back with them. She
was closely followed by the devious Husspert, recent misbehaviour
evidently forgiven, who leaped onto the nearest vacant cushion,
immediately adopting that nonchalantly undignified attitude in which a
hind leg points to the zenith, while contorted ablutions are
performed.</p>
	 
<p>It was time to go. Before long the current band of lodgers would be
returning from their work or studies. “Still a little wet behind the
ears compared to you, my loves,” confided Ma Wheggs, “but not entirely
without promise.”</p>
	 
<p>“Well, they couldn’t be in better hands, Ma Wheggs, as I’m sure we’d
all agree,” said Strag, helping Yethne on with her coat. There was
general assent, as they all gathered their belongings and shared a
reciprocal hug with their favourite landlady on their way to the front
door.</p>
	 
<p>“You two girls behave yourselves, now.” Addressed to Tebbi and
Cendrel, this instruction, much like the admonitions to Husspert,
carried the implication that she had done her best, but could not be
held responsible for the inevitable lapses of judgment that lay ahead.
</p> 
	 
<p>“Now, Mr Plitter and Mr Vext, my young speedsters. Promise me you’ll
take good care of yourselves, and those vehicles of yours.”</p>
	 
<p>“Without a doubt, Ma Wheggs.” “Any time you want to come for a
ride…”</p>
	 
<p>She smiled. “That’s very kind, but you know how busy I’m kept
here…”</p>
	 
<p>“Dear Mr Wilderfoot, our man of letters, lovely to have you back, if
only for half a day. And Yethne, my dear…” She leaned closer to murmur
in Yethe’s ear. “You could do a lot worse, you know. He dotes on you, in
case you haven’t noticed.” Yethne’s eyes widened, and her sudden flush
was hidden from Strag by the upturned collar of her coat. </p>
	 
<p>They gathered at the foot of the path, sheepishly reluctant to
disperse into the late Spring afternoon, still suffused with the
residual inner glow induced by a return to No.149. </p>
	 
<p>“Strange to think I was barely out of school when I first came
here.”</p>
	 
<p>“Well, after all, this was our second home,” said Tebbi. “We all had
a lot of growing up to do.“ </p>
	 
<p>Sawly half-jokingly suggested that it was a complete mystery how they
ever survived each other’s company for so long.</p>
	 
<p>‘I mean, what with Ruckers being so stubborn, and quite out of
control,” he added, mischievously.</p>
	 
<p>“And you so preoccupied with your designs you could barely manage
more than five or six slices of toast at breakfast...”</p>
	 
<p>The rest of them hastened to join in.</p>
	 
<p>“…and Cen so suspiciously quiet, but wildly impulsive…”</p>
	 
<p>“Oh, dangerously so..”</p>
	 
<p>“…and Tebbi so loftily self-possessed…”</p>
	 
<p>“Virtually unflappable! I tried to make her flap, but failed
miserably.”</p>
	 
<p>“That’s because I need the wind under my wings, Strag. Hot air simply
isn’t enough. Speaking of hot air, what about Yethne, keeping us all
awake with lectures on crop rotation?”</p>
	 
<p>Strag couldn’t resist interjecting. “Ah yes, how to spin a turnip.
The very memory leaves me faint.”</p>
	 
<p>Suppressing a giggle, Yethne was quick to respond. “And so it should,
Strag, considering that turnip-spinning became so popular it had to be
banned by the Society for the Protection of Abused Vegetables.”</p>
	 
<p>As their mingled shadows slowly lengthened, a moment’s respectful
silence greeted the mention of this adroitly conjured organization, and
by consensus Yethne was awarded an unspecified but generously large
number of imaginary points. This accolade served as a cue for departure.
Cendrel and Tebbi opted to head for the park, Sawly said he might as
well accompany Ruckney back to the landshrinker, since it was not too
far from Lemp’s Runnel, where his skimmer was moored. Yethne had a
little research to do for a school project, but still had a day in hand,
and was happy to comply with Strag’s offhandedly hopeful suggestion that
she might like to help him choose a present for his grandmother’s
birthday. They set off in the direction of the market, chatting
amicably, walking companionably close together. Afterwards neither of
them could quite remember who had first put an arm round the other’s
waist, or how, by the time they had reached the market, their fingers
had somehow become agreeably intertwined. </p>
	 
<p class=drop>The micropod had gently disgorged its last cargo in the
dropbox outside the Wilderfoot house in Horm, provoking an unusual stir
of activity. </p>
	 
<p>Pled Wilderfoot handed the parcel to his mother-in-law, who set about
slowly peeling away the layers of packaging, disclosing at last a
glimpse of something sleekly furred. </p>
	 
<p>“Why would anyone want to send you a dead rabbit, Marla?” asked Pled,
with impish innocence.</p>
	 
<p>With a squeak of fright the old lady hastily pushed the offending
gift off her lap, while her wearily unamused daughter came to her
rescue.</p>
	 
<p>“‘Take no notice of him, mother. Pled thinks he’s being funny.” She
cast him a reproving glance and retrieved the débris from the floor,
separating the wrapping paper from what was evidently a pair of
slippers. </p>
	 
<p>“Here mother, it’s a pair of thermoderms, with a little note from
Strag.”</p>
	 
<p>Marla composed herself, affecting an air of injured dignity, while
allowing her daughter to fit the slippers on her stockinged feet.
Something akin to a sigh signified that she was not displeased. She read
the note from her grandson, nodded, muttered “Good boy,” and dropped off
to sleep.</p>
	 
<p>“That’s unusually thoughtful for our Strag. We’re more used to being
given those little animal ornaments, or packets of health food, aren’t
we, dear?”</p>
	 
<p>“There’s a lot more choice in the city, Flutz.”</p>
	 
<p>There was a flicker of maternal intuition. “Perhaps he’s found
himself a girlfriend.”</p>
	 
<p>“Well Flutzy, he’s in Snoak. Odder things have happened there.” He
looked across at the gently snoring Marla and chuckled. “<i>Two</i> dead
rabbits,” he said.</p>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The servant's shrieks had woken the house
far earlier than usual. Amidst the smell of baked rolls, and the cooked
meat of breakfast, a clangor arose in the richly decorated halls of the
Lavelle household. Rami, the owner of several ripe parcels of land
outside of Grislain, had stormed from his bedroom, saber in hand, and
robe flapping in his haste. Unkempt, graying curls floated around a
sharp, stern face, sending servants scrambling from his path. The
night’s fog still clung to his thoughts, making him more of a grumbling
bear than anything else. Hopefully, whatever fool had dared wake him so
rudely would be dealt with <i>before </i>he arrived to the scene. </p>

<p>What greeted him, however, was not some intruder, but several of his
men and women attempting to calm Arian. The young boy, he saw, was
covered in fresh blood, and weeping helplessly as he was led away. A
silver tray lay among the spilled tea and shattered cups, forgotten by
the others, who spoke in hushed tones and cast fearful glances at the
closed door. </p>
	  
<p>"Sir, please." Khonwen, a hawk-nosed man with dark, slicked-back hair
who had been with Rami since he was a boy, gently took him by the arm.
"I
apologize for the disturbance. If you would like to wait in your study,
I will arrive with breakfast and an explanation, shortly."</p>
	  
<p>"What happened?" Rami handed the sword to him, but made no effort to
leave. Khonwen pulled, slightly more insistent, on his master's arm.
</p>  
	  
<p>"Sir, I promise - "</p>
	  
<p>"Where's Delilah?" he said. In his haste, and with the remnants of
sleep still caked over his thoughts, he hadn't realized they stood
outside his daughter's room. Khonwen seemed at a loss, and refused to
look him in the eyes. "Delilah?" </p>
	  
<p>"Sir, <i>please!" </i></p>
	  
<p>Rami shoved him aside, dread worming its way into his heart. He
vaguely felt someone try to hold him back, to no avail. </p>
	  
<p>The floor was slick under his house slippers, and he banged his knee
against an overturned chair. Righting himself, he padded towards his
daughter's bed, the blankets piled thickly upon her. A faint hope that
she'd, perhaps, simply absconded in the night, and had yet to return,
was dashed at the smell. Shaking, he finally looked at the floor in the
early morning light - blood coated the floor, lending the scent of metal
and gore to the air. So very, very much blood, he realized, seeing it
pool thickly by the bed. A firm hand grabbed him, pulling him away. </p>
	  
<p>"Sir, this way. You... Please don't look."</p>
	  
<p>Khonwen had begun leading him away from the bed. Unshed tears
glistened in his dark eyes, and his lip trembled through his desperately
composed fa&ccedil;ade. Rami nodded slowly, allowing himself to be led
away.
</p>  
	  
<p>"She's not feeling well, yes?" he asked, in a timid, scared voice
that didn't quite seem like his. </p>
	  
<p>"Of course, sir." Khonwen gestured at a few of the staff, and he
whispered something harsh and clipped to them. Pale-faced and shaking,
they scurried away. "Breakfast will be done shortly," he assured Rami.
"I will make sure... that Delilah is sent down when she wakes."</p>
	  
<p>Rami nodded slowly. <i>Yes, she was only ill, that was it. That was
it... </i></p>
	  
<p class=drop>"This doesn't look like Karlis."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie shut her eyes briefly, trying to fight off the impending
headache. The caravan they had joined on the way to Grislain had been
full
of humorless folk who didn't believe in creature comforts. Among them
were, given the state of their backsides and ringed eyes, properly-built
wagons. The road had been unforgiving, with each bump and jostle feeling
like it would shake the damned things to pieces. Even worse was the fact
that the
passengers tended to be normal folk, meaning that Rosalie's legs usually
ended up dangling out the back. By the time they reached the city gates,
the trio shared a silent vow to never again suffer such circumstances.
</p>  
	  
<p>"Oh, another perilous adventure! You know I *never* tire of things trying
to eat me." Sarah clasped her hands in false joy, her face dimpling as
she spun in wonder at the opulent waiting area of House Villago.

"There's been a change of
plans." Rosalie stretched, working the last
cramps from arms and shoulders muscled enough to give the boldest enemy
pause. The scraping and clanking from the heavy plates of her armor
echoed around her, and she let her great-maul rest by her feet. The
faceplate of her helmet rattled when she yawned, its horns giving her
the appearance of a sleepy rhino. </p>
	  
<p>Brown and black leather armor creaked, and crimson hair flashed in
its tight bun, making the fierce smile that beamed from her pale, smooth
face seem almost festive. Her button nose crinkled, making her look for
all the world like a
princess from some far-off land. The twin short-swords that nearly
toppled a vase when she spun did much to dispel the image, sheathed on
either side. </p><p>The third, and final, member of their band, Merry,
lounged	under her black cloak
on a plush, cream-and-gold couch, sniffing at a vase of sapphire
flowers.
The Villago emblem of an orange eagle, with wings of
thorns had been etched into the side of the vase. As she did, the soft
hum of a
violin could be heard from her, low and mourning. Bone-white hair
spilled out from under her hood, framing a curious, youthful face, with
large, amber eyes that seemed to always be staring at something no one
else could see. Thick, expressive eyebrows bounced atop olive skin as
she studied the room. When she sat up, a plain white shirt, and begrimed
pants were revealed, with only a leather-and-chain doublet for
protection. </p>
	  
<p>A marble table with a bowl of fresh pears sat among a floating pool
of fish that swam awkwardly through the air. Rosalie absently batted one
away when it tried to dart through her hair, crinkling her nose at the
creatures' humid, moldy smell.</p>
	  
<p>"We're not going for a rest, just yet."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie rubbed her eyes at Sarah's darkening expression. She
should have known better. Everyone had been exhausted after their last
adventure, and gods knew <i>she</i> would have preferred to lounge some
place where you didn't have to trade watch every night. Still, when
she'd seen the paper flapping against the newsboard...</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie snatched a pear just before it would have smacked into her
face.
Sarah bit sloppily into her own, and sucked the juices from the fruit
with obnoxious gusto.</p>
	  
<p>"Are you going to tell us anything about this mystery assignment, or
are we going to have to guess?"</p>
	  
<p>"Someone's been cutting people up at night," Merry interjected, her
eyes peeking over the top of a fat pillow. "Makes a pretty mess, too,
from what the town guards were muttering about." </p>
	  
<p>"It was on the way," Rosalie said, adjusting her helm.</p>
	  
<p>"We passed a badger den a couple days back, 'on the way', but you
didn't see us stopping to see if they needed help...settling in for the
winter!" she sputtered.</p>
	  
<p>"Don't be silly. They won't need to do that for several months
yet."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie turned away so the others wouldn't see her smirk. She allowed
herself a brief moment of victory when Sarah huffed, and Merry's song
plunked happily. Thankfully, that seemed to be all the complaint Sarah
had in her, and she fell silent as footsteps echoed from the hallway.
</p>  
	  
<p>Dressed in a pure white shirt, and charcoal jacket, the man who
entered looked every bit as wealthy and upper-class as the house had
suggested. Raven-black hair was slicked back and tied into a short
ponytail; deep brown eyes studied them from a sharp, handsome face, free
of wrinkles, despite his age. </p>
	  
<p>"Thank you for coming so swiftly. I am Estil Villago, and wish I
could
welcome you under less dire circumstances." His voice was soft, but
rich, someone who could shake the room with their rage, if they needed
to. He didn't so much as bat an eye at Rosalie's height or armor,
grasping her hand firmly even as he tilted his head back to meet her
eyes. She had to fight to keep them from watering at the man's
overpowering cologne. "I was doubtful that anyone would respond at all,
given our area's...reputation."</p>
	  
<p>"The folk we traveled with were certainly cautious," Rosalie said,
and ignored Sarah's stifled laugh. "Cautious" would be giving the
nightly warding of the campsite, and the twitchy bowmen standing with
strings half-drawn at all times, a generous gift. Merry skulking in the
corner singing to herself, only her mouth peering out from the hood, did
nothing for their nerves. "But we couldn't bring ourselves to pass by.
Given what you're offering," she added. His thin mustache twitched at
the gauche comment, but nodded. Whatever he was going to say was
interrupted by the arrival of a servant carrying a silver tray laden
with tea, and assorted nutted breads and jams. At least, he had the
bearing of a servant, though the swarthy newcomer dressed more like he
had
spent the night at a bawdy house. An emerald vest had been hastily
buttoned over a wrinkled, silver shirt. From the undone collar to the
loosely-laced shoes, he seemed to have been sleeping in his uniform.
Black curls peppered with gray hung about his face in a mess, and
several days of beard grew unchecked. His eyes stared ahead blankly as
he began setting out the plates with shaking hands. So low as to be
almost unnoticed, he sang-mumbled something somber and reverent. </p>
	  
<p>"Khonwen, please," Villago said, taking the tea from his hands,
irritation washing over his face. "You already put my boys to bed. You
don't have to keep doing this."</p>
	  
<p>"A sliver of normalcy in dark days helps more than you might think,
sir," Khonwen smiled, but let Villago pour the tea. His hands free, he
rubbed at a golden token that was wrapped around his wrist by a cord - a
gilded shark's tooth, a
small compass, and a pair of keys. "These are?" he asked hopefully.</p>
	  
<p>"Ah, yes, forgive me." He motioned for the hunters to partake, and
clapped the servant on the back. "This is Khonwen, a long-time friend,
and retainer to Rami Lavelle. Rami's daughter was, ah... the reason why
we asked for help."</p>
	  
<p>"Your priests are your servants?" Merry asked, staring at the gilded
shark's tooth charm
around Khonwen's wrist. He smiled weakly, pushing it back up his sleeve.
</p>  
	  
<p>"Less a priest these days than I used to be," he said. "But I found -
"</p>
	  
<p>"Seems a rather hasty
proposition," Sarah
interrupted around a slice of
bread, glancing over the paper from Rosalie's bag. "This was only posted
a day or two before she saw it," she said, nodding at Rosalie.
"Shouldn't locals get a fair shot at this first?"</p>
	  
<p>"I'm afraid most who <i>could</i> help fled for safer lands some time
ago" Khonwen said. His teeth clicked, and he took a breath to calm
himself. "Some of us," he said, ignoring the shadow that fell over
Villago's face, "felt that perhaps specialists wouldn't be unwelcome,
given the nature of the... the murder," he managed. "She was eaten." His
face had gone pale, and clasped his hands behind his back. "Mostly. Some
was... there were remains," he finished, lip trembling. </p>
	  
<p>"And she hasn't been the first," Villago added. "There've been a
string
of killings over the past several months, across the city. Sometimes
people will disappear from their beds, others simply don't find their
way home at night. Much of the time they aren't found until days
later."</p>
	  
<p>"So, now that enough of you have died, you finally get off your
pillows, and send word for help?" </p>
	  
<p>"Sarah!" Rosalie hissed.</p>
	  
<p>The sellsword licked her fingers clean, and shrugged. "Maybe if
they'd moved quicker they wouldn't have to empty their coffers."</p>
	  
<p>"I apologize for my associate," Rosalie assured their employers,
quietly beckoning Merry behind her back. A moment later, her song hummed
with idle violins. The magic did its job well though, banishing
Villago's
clenched jaw, and lessening Khonwen's guilt-stricken face.</p>
	  
<p>"Do you have any idea what it is?" Merry asked, the music continuing
even as she spoke. </p>
	  
<p>"The surrounding roads are exceptionally dangerous," Khonwen said,
collecting their empty plates. He seemed to find solace in filling his
r&ocirc;le, his voice gaining strength as he composed himself. "Hundreds
of
people go missing every year. Probably far more, in reality, since we
only hear about the ones who meant to come to Grislain. In all
likelihood, something has now decided it would be easier to reside in
the
city, than to prey on wary travelers." </p>
	  
<p>"No one has seen it," Villago said. "At least, no one reliable. I
truly
wish we could tell you more but..." He spread his hands helplessly.
"Will you help us?"</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie glanced at her comrades – Merry had stuffed another slice of
bread into her mouth, and Sarah only flicked an eyebrow at her, neutral,
but annoyed all the same. </p>
	  
<p>"For double," Rosalie said. She allowed herself a tiny bit of joy
when Sarah coughed behind her. "Assuming," she added, cutting off
Villago's protest, "that we finish it within three days. Consider
it... extra motivation."</p>
	  
<p>Villago's jaw tightened, and a vein bulged in his forehead. He
glanced
at Khonwen, who had been waiting slightly behind, and to the side. The
servant's face was blank, but his shoulders drooped, expecting the
hunters to be summarily evicted. With a deep breath, Villago turned back
to Rosalie, and took her hand with his own.</p>
	  
<p>"Excellent," she said, resisting the urge to wipe her hand after the
clammy grasp. "Do you know where we should start?"</p>
	  
<p class=drop>As the monster frothed and scrabbled against her
song-ward, Merry wondered why things like these <i>always</i> stank. It
shrank back as the magic flared to brilliant light, <i>The Ballad of Sir
Luwain</i> sending tendrils of fire blooming after it. It skittered on
too-human hands and feet, its bones piercing the flesh like yellowed,
broken talons. Cautiously, it attempted to circle her, the fanged maw
attached to an obnoxiously long, bloody spinal cord, swaying as it did.
Fortunately, with her back against the sewer wall, there was nowhere to
circle <i>to. </i>Angered by the lack of opportunity, it lunged at her,
only to rebound from the fiery barrier with a screech. Merry only
sighed,
wishing that, for once, their prey would make its lair some place like a
flower garden, or by a bakery, rather than the endless sewers, crypts,
and the like. She tapped her feet gently against the wet ground, adding
a simple charm for sleep into her barrier, should the monster attack
again. </p>
	  
<p>Not that she had to worry. Rosalie, silent as ever, charged from the
side with her shield held high. The impact made a wet <i>splat,
</i>and her foe flew a
good distance before rolling to a stop. She roared, thundering after it,
and bringing her great-maul around in a savage arc. The beast sprang
away, barely avoiding a blow that shook the ground. </p>
	  
<p>"Merry!" she yelled as claws screeched across her shield. Her answer
was the sound of trumpets, and a ghostly knight on horseback charging
between Rosalie and the slavering beast. The next blow struck true as it
recoiled, eliciting a hideous moan as the monster tumbled across the
ground. It twitched weakly, snapping and spitting as it began to slink
down the tunnel. Rosalie followed, determined to finish this then and
there, but wary all the same. The air shimmered around her, and with the
sound of rusted chains dragging along the floor, the image of a giant's
club wreathed with skulls and nails formed around her maul. The points
gouged furrows in the ceiling, and deep, ominous drumbeats echoed with
the pull of the chains as she moved. With a burst of speed, she closed
the gap between her and her prey, sending the great-maul whistling
through the air.</p>
	  
<p>She barely managed to change its course, ripping a troll-sized
gash in the sewer wall. The flash of a blade in the darkness just
reached her eyes as she spun, the monster letting out a wet gurgle as
twin swords hewed through its neck. They fell again and again, hacking
the body to pieces while it spasmed. </p>
	  
<p>"Ha! Ugly bastard!" Sarah crowed triumphantly, putting a foot on its
back to heave one of her swords free. "And you said you didn't want to
split up." She whistled cheerily, kicking the corpse once more for good
measure. </p>
	  
<p>"Yes," Rosalie said, shaking the rubble off her maul. "Where
<i>would</i> we be without you bursting unannounced from the dark in the
middle of a fight?"</p>
	  
<p>"Still swinging at air, I'd bet." She patted Rosalie's cheek,
smirking at the wall. "If you're going to insist on using that thing, we
really need to work on your aim. Sing me out, will you?" she tossed at
Merry, with a rogueish wink. A playful drumbeat amidst the low strums of
a guitar followed the sellsword as she strutted away. Merry gave Rosalie
an apologetic shrug, following quickly – but not so quickly that Rosalie
didn't see the smile blooming on her face. Sighing, she grabbed the
monster's head for identification. At the very least, this little
side-step was finished. </p>
	  
<p class=drop>Rosalie heaved herself up from the sewers, bag in hand
with their proof. She glanced about as her companions made their way to
the surface, but no one paid any attention to the strange women. In
fact, many averted their eyes, and gave them a wide berth - it wouldn't
do to draw the ire of an armored warrior with a bag that wept strange
blood. Sarah grunted as Merry helped her out of the sewer.</p>
	  
<p>"What're you waiting for?" she asked Rosalie, wrinkling her nose as
she realized how filthy her armor was. </p>
	  
<p>"Courtesy dictates you wait for others," she responded, resting her
weapon on a shoulder. "Not run off to the nearest tavern to begin a
celebration."</p>
	  
<p>"Not that you could in your armor," she snorted. "Step lively.
Sooner we're on the road the better."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie's eye twitched as Sarah strutted off. Merry was quick on her
heels, tugging Rosalie along with a bright smile that couldn't help but
be contagious. It soon faded, however, when only a few streets away they
found a mass of people crowding around a storefront. A faded sign above
the window revealed it to be a tanner's shop - <i>Elan's Immaculate
Creations in Leather</i> looped across the wood in gold letters.
Underneath, several guardsmen stood with dour expressions, keeping the
throngs of humanity at bay, if not actually moving along. Merry pulled
Sarah to an irritated stop near the back; her eyes met Rosalie's,
darting to the store meaningfully. </p>
	  
<p>"...Adol yet?" someone murmured in the crowd.</p>
	  
<p>"No, the boy’s still home. The guard dispatched a runner to let him
know about..." </p>
	  
<p>"Ah...Hopefully it'll reach him in time." The speaker shook their
balding head forlornly. "No one should have to stumble in on this."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie kept listening, but the crowd was frustratingly vague as to
what, exactly, had happened. After a little while of trying to sort out
details from the generic sorrow of passers-by, she became aware of Sarah
standing impatiently at her shoulder.</p>
	  
<p>"Imagine my surprise when I turned around to find the two of you half
a city back," she muttered. "Please don't drag me into another
freelance."</p>
	  
<p>"Merry needs us to create a distraction." Rosalie's lips curled into
a smile
when
Sarah's teeth clicked. Searching quickly, she just barely caught a flash
of white before it disappeared into the alleys that, presumably, led
behind the tanner. </p>
	  
<p>"Right," Sarah said, stretching her neck. "Who started it last
time?"</p>
	  
<p class=drop>Merry slid along the shadows, peering around a corner. She
ducked back at the sight of guards still at the back door, but she
didn't have to wait long. The sound of a fight breaking out in the crowd
echoed off the walls, drawing the serious-faced men away from the doors
and windows. Several grumbled as they loped away, hands already on their
sword hilts, but their relief at being away from the tanner was
palpable. Of course, they still had the foresight to lock the door
before they left, she realized with a sigh. </p>
	  
<p>The lock was beautiful and free from tarnish, set into a door that
fairly hummed with enchantment. The owners had clearly spared no expense
- the hexagonal keyhole needed a custom ring, and anyone who attempted
to pick it would be in for a painful surprise. </p>
	  
<p>The mechanism clicked softly as Merry's song floated through it. She
strode through fearlessly - Her comrades were
accustomed to drawing attention when it suited them. The smell of death
was thick in the air; blood
soaked through the cloaks that had been lain across a pair of bodies.
The night's violence, however, was clearly painted in the dark red
smears on the floor, and sprays across the work tables. Handprints could
be seen where someone had tried to crawl away - and been dragged back.
</p>  
	  
<p>A muted cry to "Cease this madness!" focused her. There was only so
much time for her investigation. Holding her breath, she lifted the
first cloak.</p>
	  
"What...What..." </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie and Sarah had escaped the guards easily enough, who didn't
truly wish to chase an armored warrior and her insane companion. The
women stopped brawling soon as they heard Merry's drumbeats in their
ears. They followed the sound through winding alleyways, until finally
reaching Merry. The golden, musical soldier of Warrior's Lament stood
by, carefully depositing a body on the ground, before vanishing. </p>
	  
<p>It looked like a gentleman dressed for a night at a theater - if
they had starved themselves on the rack first. Too-long arms tipped with
yellow, curved nails painted with blood stretched past its knees; almost
emaciated, its face seemed to leer at the world, its eyes sunken and
bloodshot. Merry grinned madly, pressing the sides of its face, forcing
the jaw to flop open to the chest. Rows of tiny, needle-sharp teeth
gleamed in the light.</p>
	  
<p>"No wonder the guards were so nervous," Rosalie said, batting Merry's
hands away from the horror's face. </p>
	  
<p>"This too." Merry held up a broken crossbow bolt. "One managed to get a
lucky shot off before they got gobbled."</p>
	  
<p>"Stinks of grave dirt," Sarah broke in, nudging the monster with a
sword. "Big city like this, makes sense they'd have restless dead." She
grinned suddenly. "D'ya want to bring the guards in on this? How many
you think will find themselves too ‘sick’ to join us?"</p>
	  
<p>Her smile faded when Rosalie only stared at the body. Almost
unnoticed, she rubbed a twinging, old scar through the breastplate, and
turned away. The others jumped after her as she stalked out of the
alley, rigid with anger. </p>
	  
<p>"We're leaving, soon as we're paid for the... thing in the sewers,"
Rosalie said, nearly four streets later. </p>
	  
<p>"What, really?" Sarah shouted, trying to keep up. She smiled
nervously, but gave up as she tried to follow the reasoning. "Why?"</p>
	  
<p>"We were hired for one creature," she snapped, "The appearance of
another smacks of either foolish assumptions, or uncomfortable secrets.
It's not worth risking our lives fig - What's Khonwen doing over
here?"</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie followed Merry's curious gaze to a makeshift table down the
road. There, the servant sat with a young man, who was stirring
something in a bowl listlessly. Clean-shaven with his hair tied in a
topknot, he had a soft, friendly face that looked like any other day
it’d break into a smile for the smallest reason. Khonwen was leaning
forward, saying something that brought a tiny bit of life to the man's
face. It didn't last long though, and he returned to swirling his food
about, and staring into the bowl. Khonwen's face was pained, and he
absently stroked the gilded shark's tooth token about his
wrist, murmuring
something with his head bowed. A few moments later, he placed a small
figurine by the man’s hands, and left him to his food. Khonwen rubbed
his face wearily; he saw the hunters down the street when he was done,
looking as though he had aged half a lifetime since they last saw him.
His feet shuffled in the dirt, and he seemed as though he would rather
be
anywhere but in front of them. Despite that, he nodded in greeting,
retrieving a small envelope from a pocket. </p>
	  
<p>"I've heard of your success," he said, presenting it to Rosalie.
"Congratulations, and our thanks, are in order. Word travels
quickly when three strangers emerge from the sewers with a monster's
head," he added, offering a tight smile. "I hope none of you were
injured in the struggle."</p>
	  
<p>"No, we were fortunate," Rosalie assured him, taking the envelope
from him – a promissory note with Villago's house crest stamped heavily
into the wax. She tucked the musty-smelling paper away carefully in a
hidden pocket inside her armor. "Especially given that we went hunting
uninformed there were <i>multiple</i> creatures hounding your city, and
we had competition as well. Hopefully whoever killed the one at the
tanner’s was as fortunate as us."</p>
	  
<p>Khonwen's tensing, however slight, told her far more than his face,
which remained collected as ever. "There had been concerns that you
would be...opportunistic - "</p>
	  
<p>"How's that better than 'greedy'?" Sarah muttered. </p>
	  
<p>" - Had you known of the full extent of our problem," he finished,
gently caressing the shark's tooth hanging from his wrist..
"For all of their strengths, my master, and those like him, do tend to
be
self-absorbed." Khonwen nodded his head at Sarah slightly. "To them,
this is something for the guard – until it isn't."</p>
	  
<p>"Well, you can tell them that it once again falls on the guards'
shoulders," Rosalie said stiffly. "Assuming no-one wishes to keep us on,
we'll be leaving soon as we can."</p>
	  
<p>"Understood," Khonwen said, bowing his head. "It was good of you to
take as much time from your travels as you did. If I may, though," he
said, a thoughtful look on his face. "Take the east gate when you leave.
It adds to your journey, but it's by far the busiest route. Given recent
events, safety in numbers is never to be brushed aside."</p>
	  
<p>"Thank you," Rosalie said, taking his hand. "Hopefully this all finds
an end soon."</p>
	  
<p>"I'm sure it will," he said, nodding to her companions as well. "One
way or the other."</p>
	  
<p class=drop>The sun had vanished several miles back, and the plethora
of other travelers Khonwen alluded to had yet to be seen. Oh, the
eastern gate had been plenty busy, taking most of the day simply to
leave the city. However, once they left sight of Grislain, people became
outnumbered by the mice that darted between the bushes, and the plump,
flightless birds that chased them with a strange, warbling call. Most of
their fellow travelers had broken from the main road the first chance
they had, hurrying away with fearful glances back at the strange trio
who continued steadfastly onward.</p>
	  
<p>"This road is strange," Sarah griped, rubbing her shoulders against a
sudden wind. </p>
	  
<p>"The songs are sad and low," Merry said, which Sarah took as an
agreement.</p>
	  
<p>"And here <i>I </i>was, enjoying the road being quiet," Rosalie said,
not bothering to turn around. In truth, she was just as much on edge as
the
others. On either side the grass and trees grew tall enough to hide
danger of any size or number; the omnipresent rustling as the wind blew
them this way and that didn't help either. The worst thing though, was
during the few moments of quiet – quiet when she could hear the lack of
crickets, the absence of hooting owls, or anything else the land should
have. The thick clouds rolling across the sky, ominously keeping pace
with them, didn't ease her; this far into the forest, they had to make
do
with the occasional beam of moonlight. The rest of the time, it was
slow-going without so much as a torch, lest they wanted to attract the
wrong sort of attention.</p>
	  
<p>"Oi." </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie turned to see Sarah offering her a small, clear bead. The
sellsword was clearly already rolling one in her mouth, and from the
fresh spring in Merry's step, she was enjoying one as well.</p>
	  
<p>"Don't know about you, but I'd rather not make camp anytime soon,"
Sarah said. </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie hesitated. The bead would keep her awake and alert for a
solid day, but afterward she would sleep like the dead. The sound of
something moving through the brush – the first that she'd heard the
entire night – made her decision for her, and she popped it quickly into
her mouth. </p>
	  
<p>"We'll camp when we reach some place with four walls and a roof,"
Rosalie joked half-heartedly. Sarah smiled grimly, seeing her friend
shrug her massive shield onto her arm. Following suit, she pulled out a
blade, letting it rest on her shoulder. She beckoned Merry close,
feeling better with her in reach. A sudden gust carrying the cloying
scent of rot didn't calm her nerves, and she nearly put her sword
through Rosalie's back. </p>
	  
<p>They had come to a crossroads – or what was left of one. Signs
pointing
further down the road for D'Laq, for Greenmeadows, for Aeon's Rest, were
all plain to see, if a tad weather-beaten. A broken sign – the one that
would have pointed down the overgrown trail leading towards the smell of
death – was telling in its absence. Rosalie stared into the forest,
every part of her itching to take them <i>away</i> - and found herself
drawing her great-maul, and striding along the forgotten path. </p>
	  
<p>"...<i>Why</i>?" Sarah hissed.</p>
	  
<p>"The feeling Khonwen wasn't just being helpful when he suggested this
route," she answered softly. "And I hate leaving things half-done."</p>
	  
<p class=drop>Thick, black clouds concealed the moon, leaving only
trifling glimpses of light to the three hunters. It was made worse by
the path – the cobblestones under their feet, and tall, winding iron
gates worked into artful designs gave the impression of wealth and care,
but that had been long ago. Now, the décor was little more than debris,
the stones having been shattered, with opportunistic weeds springing
from the cracks, and the gates scattered into the forest. Nevertheless,
this
mausoleum of some forgotten family was imposing.  Rosalie
thought the atmosphere might have more to do with the almost
palpable sense of
dread issuing from the skeletal roof and sundered walls. The moon
graced them with a stray beam, revealing twin pillars standing tall to
hold up the memory of a ceiling, the faces of long-dead family worked
into the stone. </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie stopped at the foot of the stairs, dropping to one knee,
breathing slowly in the unnatural silence. Her shield scraped the stones
slightly as she adjusted her helm, and peered into the night. The stairs
were wide enough to let an army of mourners pass into the hall easily,
but had
been reduced to rubble. A broken line of sight inside
gave her pause - anyone with half a thought could set an ambush...</p>
	  
<p>She sighed, and rubbed her head at the sound of Sarah coughing and
hacking behind her. </p>
	  
<p>"Bit of dust." She smiled as she spat up the last of it, though her
nervousness showed when she touched the buckles of her armor, made sure
her
hair was still in its bun, that her short-swords were hanging by her
side. Still, she rolled her eyes as she dropped into a crouch. "Is there
a plan?"</p>
	  
<p>"Same as it always is." Rosalie reached behind her to where Merry had
slunk. The songweaver pressed a vial into her hand, filled with thick,
black paste. The magic stung her eyes when she rubbed it under them, but
faded as the darkness fell away like the sun was shining down. Sarah
grimaced as she accepted the vial, rubbing it under her eyes as well.
</p>  
	  
<p>"I hate this," she grumbled. "Why doesn't Merry have to wear it?"
</p>  
	  
<p>The woman's only response was to stick out her tongue, before closing
her eyes, and turning towards the stairs. She hid a smile by tucking a
few strands of hair back under her hood, but was otherwise still.</p>
	  
<p>"The front is still the best path for us," Roaslie said, ignoring the
complaint. "Keep close. Keep alert. Neither of you go off from the
group, Sarah, no matter what you see. Understood?"</p>
	  
<p>"Lift <i>one</i> ring, and you never hear the end of it..."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie hefted her great-maul in one hand, the other bringing her
shield to bear. "What was that?"</p>
	  
<p>"I bloody well heard you," Sarah snapped, drawing her blades, and
falling back a few steps to make room for Merry, who had begun to hum
quietly. She flourished her swords in a nervous habit, warming herself
up for the fight that was no doubt in store. </p>
	  
<p class=drop>Sarah slid quietly across the broken floor, grateful to at
least be inside. Here, at least, the mausoleum was – oh, who in the Nine
was she kidding? If anything the wind moaning through the cracks in the
walls and the now <i>complete</i> absence of moonlight made it even less
welcoming. Every so often, rodents or night birds would skitter or
flutter through the nooks and crannies, keeping her on edge. She cursed
when her foot found a loose stone, and just barely kept her balance.
How the <i>inside</i> was worse than the outside, she couldn't fathom.
Sarah made the "all fine" signal to Rosalie, who had shifted towards
her,
the colossal maul rising for a fight. </p>
	  
<p><i>Any signs? </i>Sarah signalled awkwardly, still clenching her
swords.
The others shrugged, and turned back to their own search. A sympathetic
grin passed over her face when Merry sucked in a breath, and clamped her
sleeve over her mouth. Where the outdoors had smelled musty as they grew
closer, it was at least fresh air. Here, though, the stench of the
long-dead was so strong that it threatened to overwhelm. </p>
	  
<p>Against her better judgment, she sheathed one of her swords, and
gently began moving aside various bits of debris. Here and there she
found mostly-burned candles, bowls for the burning of remembrances - so
tarnished they were brown - and the occasional scrap of clothing
torn from a corpse. </p>
	  
<p><i>Wait, what?</i></p>
	  
<p>Heaving on a piece of shattered coffin lid, she felt her bile rise at
the grisly revelation. The body of a man (what remained of it, at least)
was splayed underneath. Most of his clothes had been torn away, and what
remained were brittle with old blood. Sarah chucked a pebble at Merry
and Rosalie, beckoning them closer. Merry made a ward against evil when
she saw the body; Rosalie simply opted to heft her shield a little
higher, and scan the darkness. </p>
	  
<p>"Ugh!" </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie glanced at Sarah, annoyed, to see she had continued
exploring.
Another corpse had been jammed into a space where a coffin might have
rested in
the wall, a bracelet dangling from its shattered wrist. Dread crept up
on her when Sarah moved to the next empty space, though thankfully she
only nodded, rather than pulling whatever was in there into the light.
They crept sideways as best they could, growing more unnerved with each
discovery. Sarah finally stopped after a dozen, silently estimating as
she fully realized the size of the mausoleum.</p>
	  
<p>"Some had a lot more than one in there. I think it's safe to say this
is lair sweet lair," Sarah whispered. "Now what? We wait for them to
come
back from dinner?"</p>
	  
<p>Sarah was about to answer when Merry tensed, the sound of drums
booming from her as she wove. </p>
	  
<p>Above them, the noise of unseen things skittering through the shadows
reached their ears. Rosalie brought her shield up just as something
gaunt with four claws too many dropped from its hiding place. Her grunt
was lost in its rasping snarl as it tried to reach around and rend her
face. Sarah was quicker though, lunging forward and slicing the head
from its shoulders. Unnervingly enough, the body still thrashed on the
floor until Rosalie's maul finished it with a quaking blow. </p>
	  
<p>"Ugh." Sarah flicked bits off her blade. "Think that's - " She froze
when the great-maul sang a finger from her head. A monster with ribs
opened like a gaping maw squealed as it was smashed back into whatever
bit of earth it had crawled from. The quip died on her lips as she spun,
hacking something to pieces as it slid from the rubble. More cries of
the undead echoed around them amidst the sound of claws and decaying
feet against the ground. She didn't realize how chilling it was until
she nearly ran Merry through when she took her usual place between her
and Rosalie.</p>
	  
<p>Calm returned as the song began, wrapping Merry in a dim, silver
light.
As the haunting melody rose, thorny, ephemeral underbrush pushed through
the dirt, knotting around itself and whatever else it could find, until
it was high as their chests. Even their weapons weren't immune, wrapped
in thorns long as a man's hand. She smiled manically at the sight; it
was amazing what oversized spikes sprouting from your weapons could do
for confidence. </p>
	  
<p>"Arms up," Rosalie hissed, as a foe who was more mouth and belly than
anything else slouched through the thorns. The terrible wounds it
received for its efforts didn't slow it much. "This is going to be
interesting."</p>
	  
<p class=drop>Merry drank greedily from the waterskin, in-between bites
of jerky, shaking as she did. Singing like that always took a lot out of
her. At some point someone had wrapped a cloak around her shoulders, and
she pulled it tighter, resting her head in the folds. Footsteps, almost
silent despite the remains on the ground, made her look up. Rosalie
towered over her, ichor and bone dust coating her armor. </p>
	  
<p>"Just... Still tired," she managed weakly. "Anything else?" Rosalie
shook her head, and she relaxed a bit more. </p>
	  
<p>"<i>Oi!"</i></p>
	  
<p>They both jumped when Sarah came charging out of the next room,
stumbling over the shattered bodies. Rosalie caught her when her foot
slipped, saving her from a face-full of grave dirt. </p>
	  
<p>"Nice catch," she said, patting Rosalie's arm. "C'mon. Stop sleeping,
and help me search."</p>
	  
<p>Her companions followed swiftly as they could, while keeping wary
eyes on the shadows. They found Sarah tapping her foot impatiently at
the door to a side chamber. The door had rotted away long ago, and what
lay beyond looked like it might have been a chamber for a single coffin.
It was still used for that purpose, in a manner of speaking – gnawed,
bloody bones, torn clothes, and traveling supplies were scattered about
the room. Other rooms nearby had similarly grisly contents. After four,
Sarah finally ran out of flippancy, and leaned against a wall. </p>
	  
<p>"Job's certainly finished now." She gave a sick smile to the others,
trying not to guess at the number of victims. Rosalie and Merry gathered
her under the arms, and slowly made their way to the entrance. </p>
	  
<p>"Finished for us, anyway," Rosalie assured her. "We'll send a
messenger back to let – hells, Merry!"</p>
	  
<p>Sarah slipped to one side when Merry stopped, cocking her head this
way and that. Without a word, she began scrabbling at a bit of the wall
behind a moth-worn tapestry. Her companions didn't ask, only slipped
back into their familiar stances as she explored. Finally, a click, and
a rumble from the next room. Thankfully, nothing new made an appearance
from the hidden staircase. Even the smell was the same, though it was
enough to dash any hopes that it had simply been a smuggler's cache. The
steps were, compared to the rest of the crypt, pristine. As they
descended, it seemed like they were almost cared for. </p>
	  
<p>It was not a pleasant thought, of what might actually be doing so.
Merry began to hum strongly, greenish witchfire blossoming over her
hands and up her arms. Several orbs floated off on their own, flooding
the basement with light like tiny, plump moons. They all breathed sighs
of relief when they found the bottom, and nothing lay in wait. Then
Merry increased the light, and they almost wished she hadn’t.</p>
	  
<p>Stacked in neat, dreadful towers as far as they could see, were
boots, shirts, bags of every size and sort, belts, and grand hats, all
old, but serviceable. Or not, they quickly found. A closer look revealed
tears and holes in almost everything; what first seemed like mud and
rust turned out to be dried blood. Trunks were placed further in, filled
with enough jewelry to buy a modest kingdom, and nearby, heavy steel
padlocks waited to be affixed. On the back of each, was a horribly
familiar sigil of an orange eagle with thorned wings.</p>
	  
<p>"Don't suppose we can blame this on the nest upstairs." Sarah slid
one of the blades back in its sheath, trying to count a nearby pile of
trousers. "Maybe House Villago is just a nice, wholesome smuggling
house?"</p>
	  
<p>"His family's been preying on travelers for years," Rosalie said, in
cold realization. "Cleaning and selling whatever they had on them. He
probably thought we'd take care of the more impulsive monsters, and
everyone would go back to blissful ignorance."</p>
	  
<p>"Yeah, I sort of figured that out," Sarah muttered. "Sorry,
unfathomable evil makes me uncomfortable. Merry, is there anything else
down here?"</p>
	  
<p>She had been roaming the piles, oddly quiet. Usually even in the most
dour of settings they could still count on at least a tune coming from
the songweaver, but only hesitant footsteps reached their ears. Her face
was haggard when she came into view, still counting under her breath.
</p>  
	  
<p>"No."</p>
	  
<p>Rosalie nodded, loping towards the staircase. Sarah gently pushed
Merry's shoulders, nudging her to follow. She sighed, trying to put the
stacks out of her mind, and rubbed her face. It was impossible they had
been paid enough for this.</p>
	  
<p class=drop>House Villago was just as quietly imposing as it had been
the first time they had visited. The presence of a lush, sprawling
garden
in front was enough to set the three-story home apart from most other
houses. Not that you could see any others – it seemed the citizens on
the outskirts of the city preferred their privacy, and each building was
far enough apart that even arrows would find the journey difficult. </p>
	  
<p>Oddly enough, despite the obvious wealth, no guards could be seen
anywhere. Not that it would take many would-be thieves disappearing for
word to
spread, Sarah thought grimly, sliding past a crystal archway that
dripped with ivy. Still, not even Merry's sight detected anything; other
nearby homes were less confident, it seemed, fairly glowing with
protective magics, making House Villago stand out even more. </p>
	  
<p>"I don't like this." </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie gave Sarah a ghastly smile. "You never like anything I want
to do. Isn't this exciting?"</p>
	  
<p>"Excitement is overrated," Sarah muttered. </p>
	  
<p>Rosalie's retort was drowned out by the sound of Merry pushing
herself up into a now-unlocked window, and into the house. Her
companions fairly tumbled in after her, swinging it shut behind them.
Merry gave them a disapproving glance as she steadied an
expensive-looking bust. </p>
	  
<p>"You were taking too long." With that, she started off down the
pitch-black hallway, pausing every so often to make sure an alarm hadn't
been nestled away behind a painting, or underneath the garish
purple-and-gold swirling patterns on the walls. It wasn't long before
Rosalie and Sarah figured out why she had chosen this direction – the
smell of cooking meat wafted towards them, making Sarah's belly rumbled
happily. It was silenced quickly at the reminder of what animal that
meat had probably come from. A song, not from Merry as they were
accustomed, trailed from the kitchen, low, and cheerful. The cook's
shadow on the wall seemed to dance along with it; Rosalie held her
weapon ready, and was happy to see Sarah had her own out as well.
Silent, she slunk into the room.</p>

<p>Estil Villago, to her surprise, stood in the kitchen in a loose robe,
his hair dangling free about his shoulders. Stirring something in a pot
over a small fire, he was oblivious to their entrance. Rosalie hefted
the great-maul, intent on ending the fight before it began. She let out
the softest grunt as she prepared to swing – and that was all the
warning Villago needed. </p>
	 
<p>Her strike obliterated the fire, sending coals and meat across the
floor. The house's patriarch skittered away on all fours; when he faced
them, the handsome face was gone. Something dead and hungry stared at
them, tongue lolling out of an impossibly-wide mouth. Rows upon rows of
teeth undulated deep in his throat, his limbs stretching to impossible
lengths. </p>
	 
<p>He was aggravatingly nimble, leaping away as the next blow left a
crater in the floor. Escaping from the onslaught was made difficult by
Sarah's blades, whirling about to keep him in the room. Villago
screeched
as a hand was lopped off when he tried to eviscerate the swordswoman.
Sarah kept herself steady, allowing herself no celebration; her swords
kept a steady pace of parry, feint, and thrust. She wasn't intent on the
kill herself, but more on keeping him in one place. It was proving to be
an annoying task, like trying to smash a single blade of grass in a
windstorm. </p>
	 
<p>Sulfur filled their noses, and they threw themselves away from
Villago.
He flailed backwards as the fire washed over him, screaming and tearing
at what remained of his clothes and flesh. Merry stood behind him,
bellowing forth flames from her mouth; the floor shuddered with the
tempo, until she stood back, shaking from the exertion. Rosalie was more
than happy to take advantage of Villago's distracted mind – tile flew
everywhere when the maul fell, mixed with gore. Rosalie shook it best
she could from her weapon, grimacing in disgust. She snorted when Sarah
recoiled from the meat that had been cooking, cursing and flourishing
her
swords. </p>
	 
<p>"I don't know what I expected," she admitted, helping Merry up. </p>
	 
<p>"As long as you're expecting more of it." Rosalie shouldered the
maul, and peered around the corner. "He mentioned having boys. Odds are
he's got a wife as well."</p>
	 
<p>"What priest would marry flesh-eating monsters?" </p>
	 
<p>"Piedmont Grove," Merry whispered, strength returning to her limbs.
</p> 
	 
<p>"Ugh." Sarah wrinkled her nose. "I'd forgotten about that one. Thank
you for reminding me."</p>
	 
<p>They were shushed by a gesture from Rosalie. They followed her
through the kitchen, and into a servant's corridor. Though it was only a
dozen paces at most, being so cramped did nothing for them. Caution
stayed with them despite it, and Sarah peered through the keyhole before
pushing into the room. </p>
	 
<p>Shelves thrice as tall as Rosalie were filled with books neat as
the day they had been bought. Around the room, lamps sat next to plush,
comfortable chairs, or fine, oak tables that had game boards built into
their surfaces. The air smelled of paper and pipe smoke, and in any
other home, it would have been wonderfully luxurious. When Merry gave in
to curiosity though, and pulled a book off the shelf, she found it
blank.</p>
	 
<p>"Guess they're not voracious <i>readers</i>," Sarah joked, earning
her a look from Rosalie. </p>
	 
<p>"Oh..." Merry said quietly. She held up one of the largest books
Sarah had ever seen – a collection of tales from the bard Donwell
Solomado; her eyes were disappointed as she opened it to reveal that it,
too, was blank. </p>
	 
<p>"I'm sure we can find it from - <i>down!</i>"</p>
	 
<p>Sarah shoved Merry to the ground as something flew towards them.
Rosalie kept it from them, shattering the airborne table with an almost
lazy backhand. </p>
	 
<p>"This is why we don't talk!" she chastised them, grunting as a chair
rebounded off her shield. She dug her heels in as the attacker charged
her, slamming and grappling her shield. Massive claws yanked her off
balance, trying to tear away her defenses. In response, she rammed her
helmeted skull into where she expected its face to be. It roared, and
she saw a gaping maw dive towards her, stopping only when she jammed the
shield inside it. Rosalie swung her maul as quickly as she could,
keeping oversized hands from finding purchase on her armor. Something
landed on her back, using her as a springboard, and her assailant
squealed, falling back.</p>
	 
<p>Sarah's blades were lit with silver fire, flickering this way and
that. Though her foe was easily twice her size, a grotesquerie of
muscles and thick, clumsy limbs, the swordswoman drove it back
fearlessly. She rolled over a table, leading its attention away from the
others with feints and taunts. </p>
	 
<p>Rosalie gathered herself, carefully resting her shield on the floor.
She glanced back at Merry, whose fingers twitched and danced in the air.
</p> 
	 
<p>"If you’d be so kind," she pleaded, gripping the maul with both
hands. Rosalie sucked in a breath, and charged. Leaping, she felt the
wings of Merry's song lift her to the ceiling, and drop her – and the
maul, now glowing with power like a star – onto the monster's back. </p>
	 
<p>It was quite possibly the most disgusting thing she'd ever done.
She had expected some sort of resistance, possibly even that it might
continue fighting afterwards. Smashing its bulbous head like an overripe
pumpkin, its flesh boiling and melting away from the maul as she fell
had <i>not</i> been in her mind. Rosalie grunted when she landed, what
remained of the creature twitching feebly next to her. Sarah trotted to
her to slap her on the back in celebration, and thought better of it
when she saw how badly she had been covered. </p>
	 
<p>"Are you finally going to buy some new armor?"</p>
	 
<p><i>"</i>Their 'children' are probably upstairs," Rosalie said, wiping
futilely at her armor, and ignoring Sarah. They both jumped when the
body sighed, deflating into a nauseating puddle of muck. "We'll catch
our breath, and look for the others."</p>
	 
<p>The sound of footsteps above trickled down to them. They started as
an innocent pitter-patter, suited to children, or household pets; they
disappeared suddenly, though Merry swore she could hear the faint sound
of laughter through the ceiling. </p>
	 
<p>"Ominous," Sarah muttered. "So...Plan?"</p>
	 
<p>Rosalie looked to the stairs, and clicked her teeth.</p>
	 
<p class=drop>"I wish you had this plan more often."</p>
	 
<p>Rosalie smiled wearily at Sarah, who leaned against a tree, admiring
the roaring blaze that was swiftly consuming the Villago estate. They
had
blocked off the stairwells and whatever cellar entrances they could find
with plenty of kindling. With any luck, anything left inside would be
forced out the upper windows. Merry slumped against a bench, tapping a
steady beat as she stared at the burning house. Even if the rest of
Villago's "family" escaped some other way, she would see them quickly
enough.
</p> 
	 
<p>Sarah was oddly giddy, tapping the pommels of her swords. "We could
invite people, have them bring meat to roast. We already have music,"
she added, nodding at Merry. "It'd be grand!"</p>
	 
<p>"We could advertise," Rosalie smirked. "'Nothing tastes sweeter than
victory – We slay your monsters, <i>and</i> your hunger'."</p>
	 
<p>"Brilliant." They chuckled softly, taking care not to bother Merry's
focus. Sarah rubbed her eyes, looking to the sky, where dawn was still
horrendously far off. "How much longer?"</p>
	 
<p>"Long as we have to."</p>
	 
<p>Sarah sighed, and resumed searching the roaring flames for movement.
Not that she needed to – soon enough a window exploded outward,
something falling heavily to the ground, wreathed in flames. Without
pause, it charged at the hunters with a strange, stumbling gait. That it
seemed to be two bodies fused into one kept it at a brisk, three-legged
walk, but the faces held twin masks of hate, flowing horribly into one
another. Whatever it was screamed at them with two voices, making their
hair stand on end. Worse, as it grew closer, so did its mouth stretch,
seemingly forever, until most of its head was a gasping hole; its hands
tore at the air, eager to find them, and tear them apart. </p>
	 
<p>It didn't make it. </p>
	 
<p>A dozen paces away, it dropped as though hit from behind. Not even a
spasm shook its body – one moment it was determined to devour the lot of
them, the next, a rotting mass of flesh on the ground. </p>
	 
Several guards stood nearby, pulling their hoods back to stare at the
conflagration. One held his crossbow with shaking hands, his eyes wide and
frightened as the monster convulsed in front of him. Strangely, none of
them  ran for help with the inferno, instead eyeing the corpse warily.
Rosalie approached them, resting the maul on her shoulders.

"You, hunter!" A guard with thick sideburns, and a ruddy nose strode up to
her, hand almost resting on his sword. "What happened here?"

"Khonwen, on behalf of Houses Villago and Lavelle, hired us to
exterminate a nest
of monsters plaguing your city. Unfortunately, a few managed to enter the
Villago household, and in the ensuing fight..." She shrugged, and stared at
the house. A section of the roof finally gave way with a sharp crack, and
roar of refreshed flames.

"We will have to confirm this," the guard said. "You will all come with me,
until this is sorted out."

Rosalie said nothing. Instead, she backed away softly, the faint sound of
flutes in her ears. The guard continued to speak to the air harshly, even
after she'd returned to her companions.

"How long will the magic last?" she asked Merry. The woman looked up from a
few baubles she's taken while setting the fire, and smiled mischievously.

"Should fade by daybreak."

Rosalie grinned, and turned to see Sarah already striding quickly back
towards the road.

"*Now* can we take a rest?" she asked Rosalie wearily as she caught up.
	 
<p>"Yes," she said, smiling tiredly as she looked back at the burning
house. "I'd say we're certainly due."</p>

[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class="drop">A man in a top hat thumped his wooden mug
of foaming beer on the round table. “Those damn alchemists. Just because
they learned a few new tricks, they think they can get all high and
mighty. They should know their place!”</p>

<p>“Those young ones have no respect,” a bearded man next to him said.
“They weren’t there to see it twenty years ago. It’s thanks to us
magicians that Ilysveil is still standing!” He then proceeded to chug
half a mug of beer in one go.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus watched silently from the corner of his eye as he wiped off
the table next to them with a grey cloth. <i>The daytime shift at Cheer
Haus is supposed to be the quiet and uneventful one. Couldn’t they have
waited two hours to come here?</i> He straightened his black bowtie and
walked over to the table.</p>
	  
<p>“Gentlemen, may I help you?” Corvus asked with a polite smile on his
face.</p>
	  
<p>The man with half a mug of beer chugged the rest of it, then held out
the mug. Yellow alcohol dripped from his shaggy beard. “Go get me
another, kid!”</p>
	  
<p>“Yes, of course, sir. Would you like anything else? We want everyone
to enjoy their drinks in a pleasant and relaxing environment,” Corvus
said, slightly emphasizing the latter part. He couldn’t kick out
troublesome patrons, but he hoped he could at least convince them to
behave themselves of their own accord, even if he knew it was probably
futile.</p>
	  
<p>The man in the top hat glared at him, red-faced. “You think we’re
being annoying, huh? Rolling it in passive-aggressive sweet talk doesn’t
make it any less of an insult!” </p>
	  
<p>“Sir, you’ve had a lot to drink. I simply meant—”</p>
	  
<p>He grabbed Corvus by his black vest. “You know who we are? We’re the
Parsentheons! Who the hell are you to insult us?”</p>
	  
<p>The man with the dripping beard stood up and grabbed Corvus’s wavy
black hair. Corvus tried to look polite and professional, but his
narrowed eyes and forced smile betrayed his discomfort. He looked in the
direction of the manager at the bar counter, but the old man merely
looked down with a measure of resigned sadness. “Yes, why don’t you tell
us your name? I’m sure your family will be happy to know their scrawny
kid messed with the magic clan.”</p>
	  
<p>“Um… gentlemen… I—”</p>
	  
<p>“I can’t hear you!” the man said, pulling on his hair. “Huh?” He
pulled Corvus’s black hair out, or rather, he pulled off the wig Corvus
had carefully crafted.</p>
	  
<p>Both men let him go and stumbled back. “S-silver hair? Are you some
kind of demon?”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus quickly snatched his wig and put it back on. A few of the
patrons whispered to each other. Their stares made his heart throb, and
their unintelligible words rang in his head. He just wanted to live out
his days quietly lazing around reading scientific journals on weekends.
He wished he could just will all the troublesome people away, but not
even the magic clan had anything as convenient as that.</p>
	  
<p>“Wait a minute. Silver hair? Wasn’t there that rumor about a
silver-haired child being born to the mechanist clan after the war?” the
man with the beard said.</p>
	  
<p>“The mechanists? Those blasphemers who reject the gods of duality?
This is perfect. Manager! You’re going to fire this kid, or the
Parsentheons will be shutting down your joint!”</p>
	  
<p>“Well, I…” the manager started, obviously torn. A tense silence
pervaded the bar, with the other patrons drinking quietly, if at
all.</p>
	  
<p>The jingle of bells at the door broke the silence. Everyone turned to
see a black-haired young lady in a frilly light-blue dress enter. Her
fair skin shone divinely
in the light of the doorway. Her thin figure
gracefully walked up to the old man at the bar counter.</p>
	  
<p>“Excuse me, I’m looking for someone named Corvus Morgenstern,” she
said.</p>
	  
<p>The manager, still in awe and confusion, pointed at Corvus. She
walked up to him casually, and he gave her a surprised look, pointing at
himself.</p>
	  
<p>“You’re Corvus?” she asked.</p>
	  
<p>“Yes. What’s going on?” he asked.</p>
	  
<p>“Gentlemen, I’ll be borrowing Mr. Morgenstern. Good day to you
both.”</p>
	  
<p>“Hold on! This guy insulted us! We’re not done with him. Who are you
to butt in?” the man in the top hat demanded to know.</p>
	  
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. I haven’t properly introduced myself. My name is Mira
Chelavye, from the alchemist clan,” she said, curtsying. </p>
	  
<p>“So are the Chelavyes picking a fight with the Parsentheons?” the man
in the beard asked.</p>
	  
<p>“Quite the contrary. I’m asking that we not fight. Isn’t it important
for the magic clan to uphold its reputation too? From my perspective and
the perspective of all the witnesses here, it seemed you were merely
harassing the waiter. Could the clan really defend you in this
situation? I’d rather not have a fight between any clans, so would you
be so kind as to let this matter drop?”</p>
	  
<p>“Tch!” the man in the top hat said. He and the man with the dripping
beard stormed out of the bar.</p>
	  
<p>“Wait! Your bill!” the manager yelled.</p>
	  
<p>The bearded man threw some coins behind him. Corvus walked over and
bent down, picking them up one by one.</p>
	  
<p>As soon as the door swung shut behind them, Mira breathed out
heavily. “Ah, I was so nervous! Maybe I need a drink too!”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus turned to her, not knowing what to say. Her sudden appearance
had been surprising enough, but with this about-face in her personality,
he didn’t even know what to think anymore. One troublesome person had
walked out the door, and another one had walked right in.</p>
	  
<p>“Oh, that’s right! Corvus, I need your help!” she said as she leaned
in close to his face.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus leaned away. “Hold on. You haven’t even explained what’s going
on.” He made his way to the counter and dropped the coins into the
manager’s hand.</p>
	  
<p>She took a deep breath, then spat out her words, gesturing wildly by
waving her arms. “OK, so there was this guy that went missing, and then
I asked my clan, and then I asked your clan, and then I had to ask you,
but those two guys were bullying you, so I had to—”</p>
	  
<p>“Slow down! You’re not making any sense. First tell me what just
happened here. Then let’s move on to the situation as a whole, alright?”
Corvus said. He motioned her to take a seat at the table that had just
been vacated by the two magic clan members.</p>
	  
<p>She plopped herself down on the chair and started talking. “I was
looking for you, and I finally heard that you were working at the Cheer
Haus. I got to the door, but then I heard yelling. I looked in the
window and saw two men shaking the waiter. I wondered if that waiter was
Corvus Morgenstern, so I decided to ask. The bartender confirmed you are
Corvus. Those guys said they were Parsentheons, so I was really nervous.
I did my best proper lady act and got them to go away. And now we’re
here.”</p>
	  
<p>“So you’re telling me that whole threat was an act? You must be an
amazing actor. I think everyone in the room bought it,” Corvus said.</p>
	  
<p>“I have to do that a lot at family functions, so I guess I’m used to
it,” she said.</p>
	  
<p>He clearly remembered that she announced her family name as Chelavye,
the alchemist clan, the second most powerful of the noble clans in
Ilysveil. He wondered what someone like her wanted with him, an outcast
of his clan. “Alright. Now can you tell me why you were looking for
me?”</p>
	  
<p>“Can we talk in private?”</p>
	  
<p>“Corvus! Table four!” the manager said.</p>
	  
<p>“Ah, sorry, can this wait until the weekend? I have work today.”</p>
	  
<p>“No, I can’t wait until then. I’ll wait here for you until your shift
is over.”</p>
	  
<p>“That’s another two hours. Come on.”</p>
	  
<p>“No, really. It has to be today,” Mira said, staring unwaveringly at
him. He could see his own brown eyes reflected in her deep black eyes.
Her forceful will threatened to overwhelm him.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus sighed. “Mr. Stromberg, she’ll have some apple cider.” The
round old man nodded and poured the clear yellow cider into a glass, and
Corvus carried it over to Mira. </p>
	  
<p class="drop">Two hours later, the last daytime customer besides Mira
had left, and Corvus was wiping down the tables. He normally enjoyed the
quiet this temporary lull in people brought, but today the awkward
pressure of Mira’s constant gaze had him on edge. Someone tapped him on
the shoulder. He jerked in surprise. The manager handed him a pouch of
coins. It landed in his hand with a satisfying clink. </p>
	  
<p>“Your pay for this week. Good work today. Leave the rest to the night
shift.” </p>
	  
<p>Corvus noticed that the pouch was slightly heavier than usual. Mr.
Stromberg was always soft-hearted like that, helping him out a little on
tough days, even if the old man couldn’t deal with the troublesome
ones.</p>
	  
<p>“Thank you,” Corvus said. The manager walked out the door for a
break, and it swung closed with a jingle. After putting the cloth away,
Corvus walked into the back locker room. He hung up his white dress
shirt and black vest and then changed into his regular grey pants, white
shirt, and green vest.</p>
	  
<p>He went back into the bar, and Mira bounced over to him. “Whoa. Now
that you’re not wearing that bartending outfit, you look a lot younger,
almost like a kid.”</p>
	  
<p>“I’ll have you know I’m seventeen.”</p>
	  
<p>“I’m almost eighteen. Maybe you should start calling me ‘big
sister,’” Mira said with an all-too-happy smile.</p>
	  
<p>She was trying to close the immense distance between them, but he
couldn’t fathom why, and that unknown made him uncomfortable. Corvus
crossed his arms. “Don’t push your luck.” He had a feeling she was
bringing trouble, and humoring her antics too much would drag things
out. <i>If I have to do it, I’d rather it be quick.</i></p>
	  
<p>“Fine. Ready to go?”</p>
	  
<p>“Go where? I thought you were going to explain everything to me.”</p>
	  
<p>“It’ll be easier to explain once we’re there.”</p>
	  
<p>He didn’t really feel much like walking around town, but he had
already agreed to hear her out, and he found it very difficult to say no
in the face of the pure yet powerful pressure she exerted. Reassuring
himself that he wouldn’t get too involved, Corvus followed Mira out of
the bar. She quietly walked down the narrow, winding brick road. He
wondered where all her cheer had gone all of a sudden. Colorful wooden
houses overlooked their path on both sides, and occasionally he would
see a woman open the shutters and hang a shirt or pants on the
clothesline that stretched between houses.</p>
	  
<p>The deep toll of the bell resounded throughout the city. Corvus
looked up. The clock tower, the black obelisk at the center of the city,
had its hand on the six. It would be nightfall soon.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">Eventually, they arrived at a small green house whose
paint had worn off. He had passed by this street many times running
errands for Mr. Stromberg but had never paid this house any mind. So
many blue, red, yellow, and green houses with wooden shutters lined this
street that no individual house stood out, but together the street
itself formed a rainbow. No streetlamps illuminated their colors,
however, as this was a commoner district. Corvus wondered what this
noble young lady would have to show him in a place like this.</p>
	  
<p>She reached for the knob but hesitated, trembling. She grabbed her
wrist and turned the knob and pushed the door open. Apparently it wasn’t
locked. The house was small and simple in its furnishings. A desk with a
few papers and a pen sat next to the window. A tall brown shelf full of
colorful books overlooked it. A black sofa was against the wall, and a
small square table with two half-eaten plates of curry stood next to the
kitchen.</p>
	  
<p>“I suppose we’re here. Now let’s hear that explanation,” Corvus said.
“First, I want to know where we are.”</p>
	  
<p>She nodded. “This is where my former uncle lived.”</p>
	  
<p>“Former uncle? Lived? What do you mean?” Corvus asked.</p>
	  
<p>“He was my uncle until last month. I’m not sure what exactly
happened, but my family kicked my uncle out of the Chelavye clan. And
now he’s committed suicide.”</p>
	  
<p>“I don’t see him here, but how do you know he committed suicide?”</p>
	  
<p>“He left a note,” Mira said, pointing to a piece of paper on the
desk.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus picked up the note and read it.</p>
	  
<blockquote><i>“Dear Mira,</p>
	  
<p>If you’re reading this, then I’m sorry that I won’t be there for you
anymore. I enjoyed having you as my niece, and I treasure all the
memories of your visits. I’ve failed my family, I’ve failed Ilysveil,
and most importantly, I’ve failed you. I’m going to join your aunt
Stella in the eternal realm, so don’t look for me. Look through the
looking glass and seek your own happiness. If it’s you, I’m sure you can
transform the pieces and find the brighter future I lost.</p>
	  
<p>With love,</p>
	  
<p>Alfonse Chelavye”</p></blockquote></i>
	  
<p>The letter left a bitter taste in his mouth. Family politics in all
three of Ilysveil’s major clans were nasty. He didn’t really want much
to do with this mess.</p>
	  
<p>“This seems very tragic, but how does this involve me?”</p>
	  
<p>“I was very close to Uncle, and even after he was banished from the
family, I often visited him. He would tell me stories and teach me
alchemy. I asked my parents why they kicked Uncle out, but they wouldn’t
tell me. One day when I was walking down the street, I saw your parents.
They said, ‘Alfonse has been removed. So it’s not going to work after
all.’ I ran over to the Morgensterns and asked them if they knew
anything about Uncle. They just dodged the question. But they knew
something about him for sure. I tried talking to any Morgenstern that I
could find. At last I found you.”</p>
	  
<p>“You do know that I’m also in limbo with my relationship to my
family, right? If you think I have any inside knowledge of the
Morgensterns, forget it. All they do is send me money every month to
help pay the rent. I have to work to fund the rest of my living
expenses.”</p>
	  
<p>“Even so, you’re the only one who was even willing to talk to me
about this. I just can’t let it go like this. I have to at least know
why he died. I’ll give you anything you want, please!” Mira begged.</p>
	  
<p>“Why are you so insistent on having me help you? You could probably
get anyone on the street, and it’d probably be the same. I’m a
Morgenstern in name only.”</p>
	  
<p>“My parents aren’t helping me, and Uncle’s gone. I’m all alone, but I
don’t think I can do this alone. I’m sorry for dragging you into my
personal problems, and I know it’s selfish, but I’m afraid. If at least
you’re by my side, I might be able to confront this issue. The way you
patiently endured those Parsentheons and the way you
were
willing to put up
with me, it showed me that you might be a good person. So please, help
me.”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus felt the barrier of his peaceful uneventful life under threat
by her intense will. He wasn’t sure if he could help Mira, and
regardless, if he accepted her request, it meant venturing into an
unknown world of trouble. Still, she had bared open her heart and
pleaded. She would give him anything he wanted. There was one thing he
had wanted long ago, but he had dismissed it as nothing more than a
fantasy. The girl standing here, though, made him want to believe it was
possible.</p>
	  
<p>“Mira, look carefully,” he said. Mira watched him obediently. He
pulled off his wig, revealing his flowing silver hair.</p>
	  
<p>“Silver…”</p>
	  
<p>“That’s right. Silver hair. A sign of demonic influence. If people
saw me without this wig, they would say I’m a demon. My family sees me
as a devil. Are you still willing to ask for the help of a devil?”</p>
	  
<p>Mira stared at him silently for a while then spoke. “I don’t think
you’re a devil. No matter what the world says you are, I saw you with my
own eyes today. You’re just a person. I’m asking you, as a human being,
to help me.”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus smiled. Indeed, if anyone could make him believe again in what
he once sought, it was her. “Don’t regret it.”</p>
	  
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
	  
<p>“Well then, let’s think. First off, how are you sure he’s dead? Have
the police investigated yet?”</p>
	  
<p>“No. That’s what’s so strange. I found the note two days ago and went
to my family, and we went to the police station. They said they’d take
care of it, but they still haven’t sent anyone over, and my parents
won’t talk about it anymore.”</p>
	  
<p>“He was exiled from the clan, vanished, left a suicide note, and the
police won’t investigate. I don’t think we can say for sure if he’s
dead, but everything does point in that direction. Let’s work with that
assumption for now.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira nodded. “At the very least, I want to know why Uncle was kicked
out of the clan.”</p>
	  
<p>“Why would your uncle be banished from the alchemist clan? There are
three reasons someone can be excluded from a family. One, like my case,
there’s something inherently wrong with that person. Your uncle was
probably in his forties, so it’s unlikely that this is true since he
wasn’t kicked out until last month. Two, betrayal.”</p>
	  
<p>“Uncle would never betray us. He always enjoyed his work and wanted
to support us.”</p>
	  
<p>“I’m just saying it’s a possibility. I won’t say he betrayed you
unless there’s evidence. Three, he did something that would bring shame
to the family or was against its principles.”</p>
	  
<p>“He wouldn’t do anything like that either!”</p>
	  
<p>“You can’t be sure of that one. Every family has its own politics,
and shame and principles are about as solid as pudding. A moral man
could still easily cross an arbitrary line. We can’t speculate, though.
We need some facts. What was your uncle doing before he got
banished?”</p>
	  
<p>“He was just his normal self. He drank tea in the morning, then went
off to do alchemy experiments in his lab, then came back home.”</p>
	  
<p>“Where was his lab? And by home do you mean this house?”</p>
	  
<p>“His lab was this house. By home I meant the house he used to live
in, right next to ours.”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus looked around and saw few signs of any recent alchemy in the
house. Only a partially erased alchemic circle drawn in some yellow dust
remained on the floor. “Did he change in any way before a month
ago?”</p>
	  
<p>“Hmm… Maybe there’s one thing. He would occasionally tell me about
the experiments he was doing, and he always talked about some kind of
new liquid property, but one day he told me about an experiment he did
with transmuting a metal. After that, though, he wouldn’t answer any of
my questions about his experiments. He had this really uncomfortable
expression on his face whenever I brought up the metal experiment.”</p>
	  
<p>“Did he say which metal?”</p>
	  
<p>“I remember it was copper.”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus looked at the suicide note one more time. “One thing’s clear.
Your uncle’s death is not a suicide.”</p>
	  
<p>“What?”</p>
	  
<p>“A real suicide note usually talks about one’s own life, failures,
and sadness, along with an apology to family and friends. This note is
clearly directed toward you only, and most of it is talking about what
you should do. It’s also interesting that he specifically says the
memories of your visits. Wouldn’t a death note normally talk about all
his memories of you? This seems oddly specific, almost like a message to
you.”</p>
	  
<p>“Maybe he was just under stress. Isn’t it a stretch to say he was
murdered?”</p>
	  
<p>“Yeah, I’ll admit, the note wasn’t enough. It put me on the fence as
to whether this was suicide, but take a look at the room.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira looked around. “What am I supposed to see?”</p>
	  
<p>“The dinner table. There’s two plates. Food for two people. And
they’re half-eaten. Someone who’s committing suicide wants closure.
Someone else was here. It wouldn’t make any sense to stop eating a meal
with a guest to commit suicide. This also makes it highly possible that
the other person at the meal killed him.”</p>
	  
<p>“Then what about the note? If someone killed him, how could he have
left a note?”</p>
	  
<p>“Because this death was made to look like a suicide. If the killer
had just killed him outright, then there would be no note. If the killer
had left him to die, then if he could actually write a note, then he
would just tell you who the killer is. If the killer threatened him and
made him write a suicide note in front of him though…”</p>
	  
<p>“He would have to hide any message he wanted to tell me.” She looked
at the note. “So what’s the message?”</p>
	  
<p>“I don’t know. This note was written for you. If anyone knows what it
means, it has to be you,” Corvus said, placing the note in her
hands.</p>
	  
<p>“I really don’t know, though.”</p>
	  
<p>“There’s nothing more I can do then. I wish you luck on finding
answers,” Corvus said. He was happy that someone had believed in him
even after seeing his silver hair and that he could help, even if only a
little. This mess seemed beyond him, however, and getting any closer to
Mira, who shone so
brightly, felt blinding, so to save himself, he
would quit while he was ahead. Corvus headed for the door.</p>
	  
<p>Mira tugged at his sleeve. Shocked, Corvus turned around. She was
looking down, so he couldn’t see her eyes through her black bangs. “I’ve
already thought about this, but you got further in minutes than I have
in days. I can’t do this alone. To tell you the truth, my parents
actually told me to forget this. I shouldn’t be here right now, but I
couldn’t abandon Uncle. I lied to my mother and father to come here. So
please, even if you can’t do anything right now, please don’t
leave.”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus didn’t know how to respond to her feelings or her burdens.
They stayed silently still for a while, but even after thinking, he
couldn’t find the words. He did realize one thing though. For the first
time in many years, he truly wanted to help someone, despite his
hesitation at accepting a responsibility that would end the quiet in his
life. This was more important than going home and reading the
<i>Scientific Quarterly</i> on his sofa; he would try harder, an
unfamiliar notion to him. Corvus closed his eyes and thought it over
again. Exclusion from the family. A murder made to look as a suicide.
The involvement of the Morgensterns. An erased alchemic circle. Copper.
The note. There was still something missing. </p>
	  
<p>“Let’s go to the library,” Corvus said.</p>
	  
<p>“Will you go with me?” she asked, not moving.</p>
	  
<p>“' Let’s' means 'let <i>us</i>', ” Corvus said. Hearing himself say
it out
loud was embarrassing, but it had to be said.</p>
	  
<p>“What are we looking for?” Mira asked, looking up hopefully.</p>
	  
<p>“Anything that helps us figure out what exactly your uncle was
working on. In the note, he told you to find a brighter future. That
means he believed something was wrong with the present. It sounded like
he was entrusting his dream to you, so something he was working on would
change the future for the better.”</p>
	  
<p>“Looks like I wasn’t wrong to ask you for help. You’re amazing at
figuring things out!” she said.</p>
	  
<p>“T-thanks.” He hadn’t heard such earnest praise before. He hoped he
wasn’t blushing.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">Corvus and Mira stepped out the door and onto the brick
road. The orange of the sunset and the shadows of the houses colored the
road in tiger stripes. They headed toward the other great tower of
Ilysveil, the Library of Omniscience. Corvus occasionally glimpsed Mira
out of the corner of his eye. He had never traveled with a friend
before, so
his heart beat nervously. As the last slice of the sun sunk below the
houses, the rays poked the edges of his vision. He squinted and looked
away. For a moment he thought he saw Mira sneaking a glimpse at him, but
as soon as he blinked it was gone. He began to fantasize what would
happen if their eyes had met, but he stopped himself. He had probably
only imagined her glimpse. <i>I wonder if this is okay. If I go down
this path, it’ll probably hurt again. I could be setting myself up for
another tragedy, but Mira’s not going to let me stop. No, that’s just me
pushing the blame onto her. I’m the one that can’t stop.</i> They
continued walking, the crystal-laden tower looming over them.</p>
	  
<p>The spiraling white tower looked somewhat grey in the darkness, but
the giant green crystals embedded all over still sparkled in the night.
A large wooden door gilded with golden hinges and the sun and moon crest
of Ilysveil stood before them. Corvus pushed the door in, and white
light poured out, blinding him momentarily. He and Mira stepped onto the
dark red carpet of a circular room that seemed to stretch up into the
heavens. </p>
	  
<p><i> The architect must have one heck of an ego</i>. Shelves full of
books covered the walls, and a spiral staircase snaked around the
perimeter. Large tables with quiet readers filled the center of the
floor. At least practicality hadn’t been sacrificed in the name of the
architect’s vanity. The light from the crystal chandelier reflected and
sparkled throughout the space. It gave the books a faint glow. The
Library of Omniscience indeed.</p>
	  
<p>He looked at the chandelier. The light shone brighter than anything
he normally saw. “Say, Mira, do you know what’s giving off the light in
that chandelier? It’s too bright to be a candle.” When he received no
response, he turned to see that Mira had disappeared. He looked around
and found her talking to a lady at a round counter on the other side of
the room. Corvus wished she had brought him along. He jogged to catch up
to her. </p>
	  
<p>“What’s going on?” Corvus asked.</p>
	  
<p>“I asked Ms. Helvenia if she had any books on Ilysveil’s three
clans,” Mira said.</p>
	  
<p>“You rushed right over here. You seem to know this place well. Have
you been here before?”</p>
	  
<p>“Yeah. When I was younger, Uncle used to bring me here all the
time.”</p>
	  
<p>“That must’ve been nice.” Corvus felt a tinge of envy, wondering what
it would have been like to have family that did such lovingly normal
things with him. He turned to the librarian at the counter. </p>
	  
<p>“And what can I help you find at the Ilysveil Central Library today?”
the purple-robed Ms. Helvenia asked.</p>
	  
<p>“Hm? I thought this was the Library of Omniscience,” Corvus said.</p>
	  
<p>She placed her hands on her thin waist, and her short eyebrows
flattened. “Oh, they simply call it that. Because of the books’ glow,
people seem to have this notion that there’s heavenly knowledge to be
found here, though if they really believed that, it’d be nice if they
donated as much to here as they do to the Church.”</p>
	  
<p>“I see. You learn something new every day. Do you have any books on
the Dominion War and relations between Ilysveil and Elvengard?”</p>
	  
<p>She pushed up her glasses. “Of course. Please wait here while I find
the books you and the young lady requested.” She stood up from her seat
and began ascending the staircase.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus turned to Mira and cleared his throat. “As I was trying to ask
you earlier, that chandelier is unnaturally bright. Do you know where
its light comes from?’</p>
	  
<p>Mira’s jaw dropped far too much for someone who was supposed to be a
noble lady. She probably noticed this too and caught herself by covering
her mouth with her hand. “You haven’t heard? It was big news when the
Parsentheons and Chelavyes collaborated to make this. The magic clan
cast light magic that gathered light and transmitted it while my family
built the crystals.”</p>
	  
<p>He probably had heard about it but forgotten, as he felt politics had
nothing to do with him, but ignorance would be of no help today. “What
do the crystals do?”</p>
	  
<p>“Do you remember the crystals on the outside of the tower?”</p>
	  
<p>“Yeah, they were embedded all over.”</p>
	  
<p>“The spell that was cast on them gathers sunlight during the day and
transmits it to this chandelier. Our family used a new technique to
construct this crystal that could delay the emission of the light so
that it naturally starts shining at night as if it were natural
sunlight,” Mira said, smiling with her hands on her hips.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus decided to humor her pride. “That’s a pretty amazing
collaboration. I didn’t know the two clans were that close.”</p>
	  
<p>“Well, I don’t think they like each other that much. It’s just that
both wanted to preserve the peace, so we decided to do collaborations
and such.”</p>
	  
<p>The clack of the librarian’s heels on the metal steps alerted Corvus
to her arrival. “Here are some books related to the topics you
requested. If you wish to read more, then just let me know, and I’ll
simply guide you to the section. These books were located rather far up
the tower. I don’t think my ankles will survive many more trips there
with a heavy load.”</p>
	  
<p>“Thank you,” Corvus said, accepting a stack of books.</p>
	  
<p>He and Mira sat down next to each other at a large table. She
rummaged through the pockets of her dress and brought out a small bag
tied at the top. She pulled the string, and the cloth unfolded,
revealing chocolate chip cookies. </p>
	  
<p>“A little snack for us while we work,” she said, pushing the cookies
between them. </p>
	  
<p>Corvus wanted to refuse for fear of getting too close, but Mira
stared at him expectantly. <i>That look is just unfair</i>. He bit a
small chunk of a cookie. A mellow spiciness floated in the sea of a
strong sweetness in the soft cinnamon cookie. He was happy beyond words
to share a moment like this with another person, but shook that thought
off immediately out of embarrassment and pain.</p>
	  
<p>He must’ve been smiling unconsciously, however, for she giggled and
said, “I’m glad you like it.” From the stack of books she grabbed a
thick black volume titled <i>Chronicle of the Dominion War</i>. “Let’s
get to it then. What do you think the Dominion War has to do with
Uncle’s death?” she asked.</p>
	  
<p>“It’s not really what I think. Call it more of a hunch. It’s obvious
Alfonse Chelavye was murdered over something related to family politics.
If we think about the current political status and conflicts of the
three families now, most of it can be traced back to the war between
humanity and the elves.”</p>
	  
<p>“Oh, I didn’t know it went back that far.”</p>
	  
<p>“Well you can read all about it now,” he said. She puffed her cheeks
in an adorably angry manner. Corvus pretended not to notice. If she
wanted answers, she would have to research academic texts even if she
didn’t want to. “I’ll be reading up on current politics of the three
families. I’ve been a bit out of the loop for a while.” Corvus grabbed a
grey folder full of newspaper and magazine articles. He started poring
through it while Mira reluctantly opened the old cover of the
Chronicles.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">The articles mostly covered the alliance and tension
between the Parsentheon and Chelavye clan. Titles such as “Parsentheon
and Chelavye Brothers in Bar Fight” were common. He also read an article
titled, “Alchemists Oppose Magicians’ Proposal to Lower Tariffs on
Elvish Goods.” The oldest article was only from 1853, just twenty years
ago. The magic clan had risen to prominence immediately after the war,
and the alchemist clan gained influence shortly after. </p>
	  
<p>The first article about the mechanists was dated 1862, titled,
“Morgensterns Build First Reliable Steam Engine.” He found an article
describing Erwick Morgenstern, his father. Erwick was quoted as saying,
“Humanity should take control of its own future.” </p>
	  
<p>The last article he picked up was fairly recent, printed just over
four months ago. He couldn’t vouch for its credibility though; the cheap
paper and big flashy letters told him this had been published in a daily
rumor tabloid. “MORGENSTERNS BUILDING MECHANICAL COLOSSUS,” it read. The
article described it as a steel golem that would serve as humanity’s
counter to the Elvish Colossus. He closed the folder.</p>
	  
<p>“What have you found, Mira?”</p>
	  
<p>“Ah! That was a lot to read. I would’ve been okay with just knowing
the basic 'Elvengard invades Al-Shath and Ilysveil and ends in a
stalemate' story.”</p>
	  
<p>“This is your uncle’s murder we’re investigating. If anyone has a
duty to put some effort into this, wouldn’t it be you?”</p>
	  
<p>She fidgeted with her hands. “I know. I’m sorry. I guess I’m just a
little nervous right now.” Her expression was more hesitant than nervous
though.</p>
	  
<p>“Still, you worked hard and finished. So? What did you find?”</p>
	  
<p>“The book gave a little more detail on how the stalemate happened.
Elvengard is actually resource-poor, so they invaded mostly for minerals
and forests. The fairies didn’t have much military power, but they had
great defenses against magic, so Elvengard couldn’t break Al-Shath’s
border. Humanity had magicians, but elves have greater inherent magic
and the Colossus giants, so Ilysveil was being pushed back. The elves
almost reached Vathel.”</p>
	  
<p>“Now that’s something they didn’t teach in basic education. I guess
the officials didn’t want to tell kids that humanity almost lost their
capital city. Anyway, and then the magicians and alchemists worked
together to repel the elves, right?”</p>
	  
<p>“I heard that story as a child from my tutors too, but according to
this, that’s not actually how it happened. The magicians kept fighting
for sure, but it was the alchemists developing warfare methods like
transmuting the ground into bombs that forced the elves to offer a
truce. Ilysveil couldn’t afford to fight the war anymore, so it took the
deal despite the elves getting a favorable trade deal.” Mira looked him
in the eyes proudly, as if she wanted approval for doing serious
research.</p>
	  
<p>“You really did find something interesting. This now begs the
question, why did the magic clan gain power if they were mostly losing
the war?”</p>
	  
<p>Mira looked pleased. “I’m not sure about that. It really is weird if
you think about it. I think it’s because the Parsentheons started
creating many new magic techniques. The light magic that this library
uses, for example, didn’t exist until twenty years ago.”</p>
	  
<p>Something clicked in Corvus’s head. “Hand me that book on the
Parsentheons.”</p>
	  
<p>She placed the blue volume in his hand. “What are you thinking?”</p>
	  
<p>“If I’m right…” Corvus flipped through the pages and found the
section of their history of magic development. The clan did deserve some
respect. It had created a few key magic innovations in the forty years
from the 1800s to the 1840s. During the 50s, the Parsentheons had then
created new magic at an unbelievable pace, but had developed almost
nothing since the 60s. </p>
	  
<p>He turned the book and showed it to Mira. “Look, starting from the
end of the war to ten years after that, the magic clan’s rate of
innovation just exploded. Now war does accelerate innovation, but if
that was the only factor, then the magic clan’s rate would be similar to
the alchemist clan’s, but no, they gained power because their new
techniques surpassed anyone else’s. How did they get these techniques?
They didn’t even use these techniques during the war. Only the elves
did. If you look at their rate of innovation in the last ten years,
it’s dropped off significantly.”</p>
	  
<p>“That means—”</p>
	  
<p>“The magic clan probably had a corrupt deal with the elves. The elves
would give them some new magic for a few years to ensure the
Parsentheons would take control, and in exchange the magic clan would
keep the peace and give them favorable trade treatment. They didn’t
count on the Chelavyes and Morgensterns outpacing their innovations in
the last decade though.”</p>
	  
<p>“That explains a lot, but we still haven’t solved my Uncle’s
murder.”</p>
	  
<p>“Remember how I said I had a hunch about this?”</p>
	  
<p>“Yes. It looks like you’ve figured something out.” She impatiently
bobbed up and down on her toes.</p>
	  
<p>“I more or less have the whole picture. The magic and alchemy clans
have an uneasy alliance, but the mechanist clan is pretty much hated,
partially because they don’t believe in the gods of duality, but also
because their engineering techniques completely reject the metaphysical.
What were the exact words the Morgensterns said
about your uncle?”</p>
	  
<p>She sat back down in her seat. It seemed she had entered her serious
mode again. “Alfonse has been removed. It’s not going to work after
all.”</p>
	  
<p>“Notice that they didn’t say anything about the Chelavyes. Your uncle
was working with the Morgensterns in secret. He probably got caught at
some point.”</p>
	  
<p>“But they wouldn’t murder him over that! My parents loved my
uncle.”</p>
	  
<p>“No, I don’t think your family murdered him. Did your family meet
anyone from the magic clan recently before your uncle’s exile?”</p>
	  
<p>“Come to think of it, there was one time someone came over. He talked
in private with my parents and then left. My parents didn’t look too
happy.”</p>
	  
<p>“My guess is the magicians also caught on to what he was doing and
pressured your parents into exiling your uncle by casting him as a
potential traitor and unbeliever.”</p>
	  
<p>“Well, if the Parsentheons are involved, that explains why the police
haven’t investigated. They have the police in their pocket.” Mira’s
expression had turned serious, but it quickly softened. “Hold on,
though, that doesn’t explain why my family kicked him out. Even if the
Parsentheons pressured them, my parents wouldn’t give up my uncle that
easily.”</p>
	  
<p>“I don’t think the exile was supposed to be permanent. They
probably assured the alchemists that they only wanted a temporary
suspension or something. If he had been completely and permanently
kicked out, then you wouldn’t have been allowed to visit him.”</p>
	  
<p>“I get that the Parsentheons don’t like the Morgensterns, but that
seems like a lot of effort just to spite them.”</p>
	  
<p>“It wasn’t to spite them. Remember what your uncle was making?”</p>
	  
<p>“Copper, right? What is it about copper?”</p>
	  
<p>“Copper conducts electricity. It’s said that the mechanists are
making a mechanical Colossus. To do something like that, you would need
to have energy circulate the body and have something that can simulate a
mind, even if all it does is follow orders. The primary source of energy
for mechanists is electricity made from steam engines. Electrical
signals can also turn individual parts on and off. If you had fine
enough copper wires, you could both circulate electricity and send
signals to the body parts. The problem is current engineering techniques
can’t create copper wires that precisely.”</p>
	  
<p>“So they turned to alchemy!” Mira leaped out of her seat and leaned
close to his face. Her mouth was wide open, and wonder filled her
gaze.</p>
	  
<p>Corvus leaned back and looked away. “Exactly. Now who would lose out
if humanity gained a weapon powerful enough to take on the elves? The
magic clan would lose its standing. The alchemists probably didn’t
believe your uncle when he talked about a mechanical Colossus, or they
thought it was too risky to jeopardize relations with the magicians over
an uncertain bet like that, so they accepted a suspension.”</p>
	  
<p>“Then who killed my uncle?”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus lowered his gaze, and his bangs shadowed his eyes. After
coming this far, he felt a sharp pain in his chest as he told her, “I
don’t know. There’s just no way to find that out.”</p>
	  
<p>She grabbed his shoulders. “No! It can’t just end like that.”</p>
	  
<p>Not moving, he quietly said, “The magic clan probably killed him
after using the suspension to isolate him, but the trail goes cold after
that. We don’t know who visited his house that day. If we point fingers
at the magicians without any evidence, it’ll be our heads on the
chopping block.”</p>
	  
<p>She released her death grip on his shoulders and sank back into her
chair. “No way…” Tears started welling up in Mira’s deep black eyes.</p>
	  
<p>He didn’t want it to end like that either. Corvus closed his eyes and
ran through the evidence again. Her uncle had been exiled due to
inter-family politics. The suspension was temporary, but the magicians
murdered him and dressed it as a suicide. The uncle left a suicide note
directed at Mira. Was it merely a good-bye? Was the story of the man
working to change Ilysveil merely that of a victim? What had he told
her, and what had Alfonse Chelavye meant?</p>
	  
<p>After scouring his thoughts, Corvus looked up at the chandelier, and
it dawned on him. “You said you came to this library often as a child.
What was your favorite book?”</p>
	  
<p>Mira wiped her tears with her frilly white sleeve. Sniffling, she
answered, “<i>Through the Looking Glass.</i>”</p>
	  
<p>“I thought so.”</p>
	  
<p>“How did you know that?”</p>
	  
<p>“Basically, your uncle told me. Alfonse Chelavye saw his death coming
and left something behind. He had a message that only you would
understand. The supposed suicide note told you to look through the
looking glass. The killer might have searched his house, so he didn’t
want to leave the real message inside the house. The real message is
here in the library.”</p>
	  
<p>“I know exactly where it is. Let’s go.” Mira, her eyes still red,
jumped up and pulled Corvus along by the hand and up the spiral
stairs.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">By the time they had run up what Corvus estimated as the
equivalent of four flights of stairs, he was panting, but Mira was
scurrying around the shelves. He found it hard to believe that anyone
could regain their energy so quickly. They eventually found the
white-covered book in a shelf and she pulled it out. “But which page is
it on?”</p>
	  
<p>“He said to seek out your own happiness. Find the page that talks
about your happiness.”</p>
	  
<p>She flipped through the book for a while until she stopped and
pointed at the page. “There it is! ‘You must be very happy.’ But where’s
the message?”</p>
	  
<p>“He said to transform the pieces. I thought about what it meant, but
then I realized it meant from your perspective. You’re an alchemist. How
do you transform?”</p>
	  
<p>“I transmute materials.” She stared at the page and then looked up as
if a light had been lit in her head. “Oh, I get it!” She placed her hand
over the page, and both her hand and the page began to glow. When she
lifted her hand, the words on the page had vanished, replaced by an
intricately criss-crossed transmutation circle that looked similar to
the one in the house. “How?...”</p>
	  
<p>“A transmutation circle doesn’t need to be visible to work. He
probably put a circle in invisible ink that rearranged the visible ink
into this alchemic circle when you activated it.”</p>
	  
<p>“What is this circle? I’ve never seen it before. I don’t think my
clan has anything like this,” Mira said, staring intently at the
book.</p>
	  
<p>“Come on. Let’s check out the book and go. The real story’s in that
house.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira closed the book. She didn’t seem as happy as he’d expected. “Are
you okay with this though?” she asked.</p>
	  
<p>“I’m not sure what you mean.”</p>
	  
<p>“You said it yourself. Our heads could be on the chopping block. If
you go with me to Uncle’s house, then you’ll know what Uncle created,
what got him murdered, and you’ll really be involved. We’ve only just
met, but I’ve relied on you so much. I don’t want to put you in danger.
Even those cookies, I guess I made them to make myself feel less guilty
dragging a stranger into my personal troubles. I—”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus put a hand on her shoulder. He remembered the frightened
desperation with which she had pleaded for his help. Perhaps she had
felt guilty all along, but her fear of heading into the darkness alone
had overcome even that. She had indeed dragged him into her problems,
but for the first time, someone needed him and trusted him enough to
share her doubts. He was the one who was grateful. Even if staying with
her meant more trouble, this time, he felt certain he wanted to endure,
but it felt too embarrassing to say it. “I wouldn’t exactly say we’re
strangers anymore. Besides, those cookies were delicious. It wouldn’t
feel right if I didn’t stay till the end after eating them.”</p>
	  
<p>She locked eyes with him and wouldn’t let go. “Are you sure?” He
couldn’t tell if she was asking him or herself.</p>
	  
<p>“Yes, I’m sure.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira seemed relieved; she turned away and sighed quietly. She stood
still for a moment, then grabbed his hand. Before Corvus could react,
she pulled him with her. They flew down the stairs, drawing the stares
of readers disturbed by the banging steps. Mira signed a slip at the
librarian’s counter then walked out of the library with Corvus.</p>
	  
<p>The sun had set completely, and the brick road and colorful houses
were now all black, with a tinge of silver lining from the glow of the
moon obscured by the clouds. </p>
	  
<p>“Can you transmute a candle?”</p>
	  
<p>“Watch this, Corvus,” she said, pulling out a few cubes from the
pocket of her dress. “I always keep a few cubes of materials in case I
need to make anything.” She held them in her hands, which began to glow.
The cubes glowed and morphed, merging into a bronze candle holder with a
candle in the center.</p>
	  
<p>“You did that without a transmutation circle?”</p>
	  
<p>“I actually have a pretty good memory, so if I see a transmutation
circle, I memorize it perfectly, and for simple transformations, I can
channel the reaction straight from memory.”</p>
	  
<p><i>I thought she was just an airhead, but maybe, she’s actually a
genius?</i> “I guess it’s true you can’t judge a book by its cover,
though in your case, it’s the cover and half the book.”</p>
	  
<p>“Hey, that’s mean.” She gave him a playful shove on the shoulder.
</p>  
	  
<p>“Now to light the candle.” Corvus pulled out a small, grey
rectangular object. His thumb pushed down on the protrusion at the top,
then the box ignited a flame.</p>
	  
<p>“What is that?”</p>
	  
<p>“It’s one of the gadgets I made. I mostly just use it to impress
customers at the bar if they want a flaming cocktail.” Corvus touched
the flame to the tip of the candle and lit it.</p>
	  
<p>“What do you call it?” Mira asked.</p>
	  
<p>“I don’t know. I never thought to give it a name,” Corvus
answered.</p>
	  
<p>“Well then, how about, since it brought light to us when it was dark
out, a 'lighter'?”</p>
	  
<p>Corvus smiled. “I kind of like that name.”</p>
	  
<p>They continued to chat frivolously until they reached her uncle’s
house again. She pushed the door open, and it creaked. The house of a
dead man was even more creepy at night. She brought the candle close to
the partially erased alchemic circle. “Is it here? But this circle
doesn’t match the circle in the book.”</p>
	  
<p>“It’s not supposed to. Remember, the killer was here, so this was
meant to mislead him. Most likely, he drew a false circle as a
diversion, and the killer partially erased it, thinking that would
prevent anyone else from using it. In fact, this is just the material
for the transmutation. Draw the circle, then gather the yellow powder
and put it at the center.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira transmuted some chalk and then drew the circle on the floor
exactly as it appeared in the book. She and Corvus swept the dust into
the center with their hands.</p>
	  
<p>“Ready?” she asked.</p>
	  
<p>“Shouldn’t I be asking you?” he said.</p>
	  
<p>She smiled and put her hands on the perimeter of the circle. The
lines of the circle glowed with an intense white light that enveloped
the room. When the light faded, the powder had disappeared. Around the
perimeter of the circle lay a thin yellowish string. She picked it up,
but it didn’t bend. Corvus grabbed the other end and bent it with some
pressure. </p>
	  
<p>“This is a pure copper wire. Thin and flexible but not flimsy. This
is what he was working on for the Morgensterns. He passed it on to you.
That’s his dying legacy.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira cried. “This is what’s left of him. One day, when we’re the heads of
our clans, the mechanical colossus…” </p>
	  
<p>Corvus put his hand on her shoulder. He found it unlikely that
he would ever be the head of the Morgensterns, but he couldn’t tell her
that. “I’m sorry. Even though I know the truth, I can’t do anything to help
you get justice for your uncle. I can only observe.”</p>
	  
<p>Mira smiled as she cried. “No, you don’t understand. This is what’s
left of him. He left me his legacy. The future that he believed in, he
entrusted it to me. We both know the truth. Neither of us can do
anything right now. But even if we can only observe, I still found it
together with you. That’s more than I could’ve asked for.”</p>
	  
<p>As the clouds drifted, the moon shone through the window, revealing
Mira’s teary yet glad form cast in a soft light, and Corvus couldn’t
help but think to himself, <i>well, if it’s with her, maybe just
observing isn’t so bad.</i></p>

[*AUTHOR] Andrew Leon Hudson

[*BLURB] <b>"Here cometh April again, and as far as I can see the world
hath
more fools in it than ever."</b>	<br><small>Charles Lamb</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">It’s a cliché, but when I wake up at first
I don’t know where I am. </p>

<p>I only know I'm desperate for tea.</p>

<p>I fumble for my glasses on the bedside table, squint when I can’t
find them, then recognise the little framed photo of our parents by the
lamp and it all comes back: <i>Joanie’s birthday party</i>. I’m at my
sister’s place.</p>
	  
<p>I roll out of bed, still dressed from last night. March 31st, but not
any more. The alarm clock by the photo reads half ten, and I groan. I
must be last up: whatever happens next will be at my expense.</p>
	  
<p>I don’t have to wait long. Joanie is sprawled on the bedroom floor,
arms and legs twisted into a comedy swastika. She missed being a fool by
twenty minutes, and now every year makes sure someone else is one. This
ploy is a favourite but she never could play dead worth a damn, even as
kids. At least after thirty years she’s learned to keep her eyes closed
to avoid the blink reflex. </p>
	  
<p>I lean close, take a deep breath and blow on her face. Her eyelashes
flutter.</p>
	  
<p>“See you downstairs, faker,” I tell her.</p>
	  
<p>Tom’s dead in the hallway, or so he’d like me to think, the clown. I
have to admire the detail: all his clothes on backwards, even the shoes,
which is a pretty good touch. I’d almost believe his head <i>had</i>
been twisted around to face backwards, if we didn’t go through some
variation on this rigmarole every year.</p>
	  
<p>My specs aren’t in the bathroom either, so I have to aim hopefully.
</p>  
	  
<p>“Excuse me, Tom,” I say as I step over him to go downstairs, cistern
gurgling behind me. </p>
	  
<p>In the lounge, there’s blood <i>everywhere</i>. At least, that’s how
it looks to my 02-20 vision. </p>
	  
<p>“Keep it up as long as you want, guys,” I call. Let’s see how long
they maintain the pretence when the frying starts, shall we? Better
still, when the tea is brewing... </p>
	  
<p>I pick my way through to the kitchen, trying to avoid the puddles
soaking into the carpet. It’s a long way to go for a prank, but who am I
to moan? It’s not my house, not my cleaning bill. But they get me via my
compromised vision when some spatter I overlooked slides under my foot,
oily and warm. “Gross,” I moan, and peel the sock off, tossing it at the
TV without looking any closer.</p>
	  
<p>The kitchen floor is cold against my bare sole. I flick on the
kettle, get a mug down from the shelf and toss in a teabag from the tin.
I grab the milk from the fridge door, and a carton of eggs and two packs
of bacon from behind the fake Edward head, which I presume to
be—appropriately enough—a decorated cabbage. Not very convincingly done,
as far as I can see. </p>
	  
<p>Which isn't far, admittedly.</p>
	  
<p>I clatter a frying pan out from the back of the cupboard and stick it
on the heat with just a splash of oil. The steaming kettle clicks and I
pour, splash the milk in early the way I like—Joanie would spit—then I
tear the bacon open and drop in the first four rashers. It's like an
instant round of applause floods the kitchen.</p>
	  
<p>While the bacon sizzles I check in the pantry and find half-empty
bottles of HP and Heinz. Can’t believe Joanie and Duncan only have white
bread though. Hands full, I nudge the pantry door shut with my knee—and
<i>that’s</i> when I notice the doubly hazy figure, beyond the frosted
glass door to the back garden. That must be Dunc. Short-sighted as I am,
it’s obvious he’s wearing something on his head. I roll my eyes, then
grip the bread bag in my teeth and open the door.</p>
	  
<p>It’s a Tim Curry-style demon mask: curling fibreglass horns, matching
red body paint, furry loincloth, fangs, the lot. Nice try, dickhead.</p>
	  
<p>“Have you got my glasses?” I mumble through gritted teeth and
plastic.</p>
	  
<p>“FEEL you yet the TORMENT of the EONS?” Duncan booms from atop
disguised high-heels, gesticulating like the talented kid in a school
play. “SUFFERING in a CEASELESS INSTANT, WAITING for YOUR turn to
DIE?”</p>
	  
<p><i>Pffft</i>. “You should have let Edward do it,” I tell him, “your
acting sucks,” and I shut the door in his face. It’s not locked or
anything, he can come in when he’s ready to give it up. I head back to
the crackling pan and lay out slices of bread on the work surface. </p>
	  
<p>“Do you want brown sauce or tomato?” I call, but he doesn’t answer,
the moody bugger, and I squirt a splodge each on to the halves of my
sandwich-to-be. I flip the bacon over with a wooden spoon from the
pottery jug, mouth watering as I do, then I fish the teabag out of my
mug and drop it in the sink. </p>
	  
<p>And then, just for a moment, I feel weird and dizzy—enough that I
have to lean on the counter to steady myself. Like when you're reading
in the back of a car and it does a lazy swerve. </p>
	  
<p>But just as quick it's gone. Must be the missing specs. I didn’t
drink that much and I’ve got no hangover, but I never go without my
glasses if I can help it. When Joanie finally comes down she’d better
have them on her.</p>
	  
<p>To help recover I take my mug and a loud slurp of
tea—<i>bliss</i>—while I wait for the bacon to blacken. The tasty scent
fills the kitchen and, I have to say, this is almost the best bit,
really. The anticipation. As good as the eating. I’ll do the eggs in the
fat when it’s done. Lovely. </p>
	  
<p>I take another sip of tea. The mug looks as full as the moment I
poured it. </p>
	  
<p>A nice, hot brew: the very definition of English Heaven.</p>
	  
<p>I could do this forever.</p>

[*ITEM] Mount Elysium Revisited

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] <b>If you haven't already read <a
href="http://www.mythaxis.co.uk/6issuev14.htm">Mount Elysium,</a> now
would be a good time.</b>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>When the second visitor in one week
'disappeared', it was no longer an interesting mystery. The two
disappearances became a pair of cases, demanding police attention, which
it soon attracted.


Julius McRaven received what he referred to as 'the local plod' in his
office, an office designed to intimidate visitors. It was a hopelessly
ornate chamber; the walls and ceiling featured elaborate bas-relief
plasterwork representing woodland and hunting scenes, a duplicate of the
original owner's trophy room, and multiple shield shapes among the
plasterwork carried realistic wild animal heads, none of which had ever
adorned a living animal. Julius sat behind what appeared to be a
magnificent 18th century rosewood desk, made in Shanghai as recently as
five years ago, nursing a glass of Laphroaig, his favourite smoky malt
whisky. He did not offer any to the Inspector.

Inspector Gordon did not appear in the least intimidated. Everyone knew
that Mount Elysium, house and outbuildings, were not the original
property, but a plastic replica created in recent history by the
Altairians, to replace the original 18th century estate, which the
space aliens had accidentally destroyed during a near-Earth battle
exercise.  Moreover, Inspector Gordon would know that, although Julius
McRaven now bore the surname of the eighteenth century owner and builder
of Mount Elysium, he was actually a Roumanian immigrant whose birth
surname had contained too many adjacent consonants to be reliably
pronounced in Scotland. Julius had deed-polled himself through three
different British-sounding names as he worked his way from penniless
immigrant to property tycoon via a few convenient bankruptcies. His
purchase of Mount Elysium represented his desire to be thought of as
Lord of the Manor, while enabling him to turn the property into a
profitable theme park.

Other than for the money they brought, visitors to Mount Elysium were
clearly an irritation, especially when they vanished. Faced by Inspector
Gordon, Julius McRaven took the offensive. "This is the third occasion
on which you've come looking for these missing persons. People disappear
all the time, don't they? "

"Not around here, they don't, Mr McRaven. Both were unaccompanied male
tourists; both came to the district specifically to visit Elysium.
Neither has since returned to his place of work or his family."

"Very well, Inspector," said Julius, "I accept that a couple of people
seem to have disappeared. Have you any proof that they disappeared while
they were in Mount Elysium?"

"Well, each of them, on the day on which they vanished, paid for entry
to Elysium using their credit chips. One, Joseph Nardik, also paid for
goods in the souvenir shop on the same day as he entered. Neither has
been seen, nor used his credit chip, since their visit."

"So, circumstantial. No independent evidence then? No actual witnesses
to their death or misadventure?"

Inspector Gordon sighed, but made no reply. The silence stretched until
Julius said: "Very well. You have dates? Photographs? I'll ask our staff
if they remember anything, and I'll let you know."

"You already have the dates and photographs, as you know. It's not good
enough. We have to organise a proper search of all Elysium."

"No. No. No. We can't have policemen charging around inside Mount
Elysium, interfering with our visitors. Let me organise a search, using
my own employees, after hours."

"Still not good enough. I have applied for a search warrant, which I
shall get, but I'd much rather organise this amicably."

"All right, all right. Mondays are the lightest days. We can manage a
Monday next month, I suppose. Plain clothes, please, and I shall assign
an employee to each policeman."

"That's preposterous, Mr McRaven."

"No it isn't. There is much delicate stuff here, and the caves and
passages are confusing."

"No. I meant the delay. We must get on with this."

"I agree. In the meantime, how would you like the CCTV records for the
days in question? Perhaps we can narrow down the search area. Cause less
disruption."

Gordon was clearly angry. "I asked for these last time! You told me the
records had been erased."

"Well, I was mistaken. Do you want them or not?"

"Of course I do."

"Here are the CCTV records for the days in question," passing a padded
envelope across. "And don't come back until you can show me some
convincing proof that these individuals disappeared inside Mount
Elysium."

Inspector Gordon, somewhat out-manoeuvred, left in obvious irritation.

Julius sat at his desk for a few seconds. Inspector Gordon was
well-respected in the area; his service in East Africa, and in the Hong
Kong police, were legendary. Julius could not hope to forestall him for
much longer.

A feverish investigation of the CCTV records had, of course, already
been undertaken by Mount Elysium staff. The vanished tourists had been
observed on the tv record, entering the Great Shaft, but not leaving it.

<p class=drop>The original Mount Elysium had been built in the
nineteenth century at the behest of the supposedly eccentric Albert
McRaven. It was, in fact, a gigantic folly, occupying a precipitous
triangle of land at the corner of Albert's brother's estate in Scotland.

The main building, sprawling up the slope, moulded itself to the steep
terrain as a sort of Gothic-Baroque confection, with columns, balconies,
towers, steeples, ornate stained-glass windows, tiled roofs at oblique
angles, fluted chimney stacks and pointed archways. Most of the
stonework was carved with chivalric or classical motifs. Inside, it was
a confusing warren of impressive, ornate halls and rooms, with tasteful,
if complex, plasterwork, panelling and woodblock flooring. Huge
fireplaces dominated many rooms. Marble stairways swooped  from floor to
floor. To add to the charm of the building, secret passages and
unsuspected rooms were hidden behind panels, bookshelves and fireplaces.

The grounds were equally fanciful, with temples, ponds, grottoes,
tunnels, bridges and lookout points. A stable block, built as a
miniature replica of the main house, stood behind trees. There was even
a hermit's cave. The whole estate, planted with trees and flowering
shrubs, and criss-crossed by shady paths, was a delight to the spirit.

A particular feature was the Great Shaft, which was a circular well-like
hole, eight metres in diameter, starting within a classical temple near
the top of the property, and penetrating vertically through the rock, a
hundred or so metres down to a paved courtyard. Around the perimeter of
the shaft wound a narrow spiral staircase. At various points, tunnel
openings in the wall of the shaft led to places in the gardens or to
secret passages in the main house. In one case, the opening led to a
three-dimensional labyrinth, and from the courtyard at the bottom, a
tunnel led to a cave behind a waterfall.

But the whole complex had been reduced to cinders and rubble fifteen
years earlier, in an accidental random strike by an Altairian
"Atmosphere-enabled Offensive Space Pinnace".

<p class=drop>The Altairian Garrison, a bevy of huge alien spacecraft,
had been in orbit around the Earth and in other parts of the solar
system for half a century before the accident occurred.

Initial panic at the space fleet's arrival had died down when the public
accepted the aliens' declared intent, which was to protect an outpost of
their sphere of influence in a  galaxy-wide rivalry with another group
of aliens. The Altairians seldom appeared in public. Their environmental
requirements were such that they required special suits to exist on
Earth.

Their effect on mankind was almost exclusively beneficial. There was an
immediate banding together of the world's nations in the face of the
potential threat. The United Nations became united in a way they had
never been before, though ancient territorial and religious rivalries
continued to burn behind the scenes. The aliens helped with the
positioning and maintenance of Earth satellites, and with the
exploration of solar system planets.

However, Altairian ethics precluded the transfer of the major
technologies they so obviously possessed to the races they encountered
in their sphere of influence, and Earth had continued to go it alone in
scientific research and development, but with, perhaps, less enthusiasm.

The aliens' activities in near-Earth space resulted in magnificent
displays in the night sky. Rippling cascades of photons accompanied
hyperspace travel. Frequent combat exercises released silent explosions
of coloured lights. To date, no actual combat had taken place within the
solar system. The very presence of the Altairian garrison seemed to have
precluded that. From time to time, with due notice, space vehicles
entered Earth atmosphere in mock battle, and it was during one such
exercise that Mount Elysium had been demolished.

The aliens, with the co-operation of the owner of Mount Elysium - Roland
Thoroughgood - had reconstructed the whole complex using existing
original plans and the millions of visitor photographs stored on the
internet. Outwardly, the re-created buildings and grounds were
identical. In reality, much of Mount Elysium was made of durable
plastics and artificial stone.

Roland Thoroughgood, his work on restoration complete, had found the
place strangely repulsive, and had sold up and emigrated.

<p class=drop>In turning Mount Elysium from stately home to theme park,
Julius had made a number of improvements. For example, a safety rail and
lighting had been installed in the Great Shaft stairway. Its original
designers had found those luxuries unnecessary, and, over the centuries,
a few visitors had plunged to death or injury. Lighting had also been
installed in all tunnels and buildings, as well as outdoor paths.
Previously, the shaft had been illuminated only by daylight filtering
down from above, and tunnels could be navigated only by groping along or
by use of flashlights carried by visitors. 

Now, cameras were mounted
everywhere, and the kitchen in the main house had been turned over to a
monitoring centre. A new visitor centre had been erected inside the main
gate, offering souvenirs and fast food. Custodians were deployed at
crucial points to guide visitors. A family of docile goats inhabited the
rockier precipices of the park, and wild ducks and geese were living and
nesting in the lakes. Julius had ensured that the animals and birds were
kept under control and in moderate numbers.

Many of the visitors these days were more interested in the alien origin
of the place than in the over-the-top architecture and decoration. Huge
numbers made their way to the turnstiles and paid their entry fee just
to feel the alien materials.

<p class=drop>No-one could clearly remember when the hermit had arrived.
Certainly it was not long before before Julius McRaven purchased Mount
Elysium. Julius
was disturbed to discover that a real hermit had already taken up
residence in the hermitage, a deep cave lined with porcelain
stalactites. Being of a suspicious nature, he had had doubted the man's
motives. However, when it became clear that the elderly, bearded fellow
accepted the rent-free cave in lieu of pay, and was usually present in
his lair when the park was open, absenting himself only on Monday
mornings, Julius now regarded him as a bargain. On Sunday evenings, the
hermit would discard his grey robe, dress in jeans and a checked shirt
and leave the estate, returning on Monday afternoon.

The hermit, who called himself Anthony, seldom spoke, and was usually
engrossed in prayer or in his book - a fat volume printed in some
unfamiliar language. Visitors were encouraged to leave offerings of food
on a shelf near the cave entrance.

When spoken to, if Anthony responded at all, he paused for some seconds
before replying, often with some entirely oblique statement. His accent
was unfamiliar. Inevitably, unpleasant people, rowdy youths or
exhibitionists, sometimes tried to disturb the hermit's serenity. When
their advances became impossible to ignore, the old man would rise to
his full considerable height and roar incoherently at his tormentors
until they dispersed or a security guard appeared to restore order.

Julius was no fool. Most visitors and staff paid little attention to the
hermit, but Julius had not become rich by ignoring detail. Studying
Anthony closely, he had realised that Anthony was not one person, but
two, each taking one-week shifts in turn. The amorphous robe and heavy
beard hid the detail of the men's appearance, and one taciturn hermit
was very like another. Julius had kept this revelation to himself so
far.

One of the results of the recent examination of the CCTV footage was the
discovery that, after the gates were closed, Anthony would sort through
the edible offerings, consigning some of them to a wastebasket, some to
the goats and wilfowl, tucking the others into his robes, and would move
around the house and estate for a while before returning to his cave,
presumably to eat and sleep. Sometimes, after dark, a faint glow came
from the inner recesses of the cave, indicating that Anthony had some
private source of illumination.

Julius now wondered if the hermit or hermits were connected with the
recent events.

<p class=drop>Julius had good reason to be worried. In addition to the
reported disappearances, one night watchman had also failed to turn up
for work one day without warning. The man was a solitary widower, and
his absence had apparently gone unremarked, except by Julius himself and
the assistant who dealt with the payroll.

The police only had two days' worth of CCTV. Julius, while delaying the
police, had examined whole weeks, and the surprising discovery was that,
in addition to the reported disappearances and the night watchman, a few
other visitors occasionally entered the labyrinth and did not reappear,
perhaps one a week. What's more, a similar number appeared from the
labyrinth who had not been seen on the CCTV to enter it. He told no-one.
Who would have believed it?

McRaven ordered a thorough search of the maze. Since it was the daily
duty of a night custodian to traverse the entire labyrinth after
closing, in case of lost explorers, Julius did not expect any corpses to
be revealed. The thorough search, using strong flashlights, was made on
the basis that there might be an unmapped exit. 'Unmapped' because
Thoroughgood and his alien co-restorers had prepared a detailed
holographic plan of the whole estate on which every room, hall, tunnel,
path, tile, panel and door could be displayed in mid-air and could be
inspected at any level of detail. The device which projected this plan
was of alien manufacture, and was housed in Julius' office.

Taking the estate as a whole, a few discrepancies had been discovered,
mostly of the 'inaccessible room' variety, where a doorway or hidden
panel had been accidentally omitted from the holographic plan,
had not been implemented in the aliens' recreation,
and had to be opened up by local workmen on discovery. Thoroughgood
had documented all the updates made. None of
these irregularities had concerned the labyrinth, but the possibility
could no longer be ignored.

<p class=drop>As originally designed in the 1800s, the maze was not
illuminated. Visitors were expected to carry a lantern. Julius had
installed strings of LEDs along the ceiling of every passageway, so that
a flashlight was no longer essential, but the LEDs gave so little light
that, although sufficient to guide an explorer, the walls of the maze
were still not well lit. This was why the detailed inspection was
carried out using
powerful flashlights. Although the maze was on three levels, there were
no steps, level changes taking place via ramps. There was a specific
entry and a specific exit. However, in practice, the labyrinth could be
traversed in either sequence. On paper, it was not particularly complex,
but once inside, the featurelessness of the walls and the lack of
visible cues as to orientation made it very confusing.
<p>
<img src="./labyrinth.jpg">
<p>
No anomalies were discovered, no unmapped passages, no mysterious fault
lines on the wall to indicate a secret panel, nothing to explain the
disappearances at all. On the top level, there was a one metre square
groove on the floor with the word 'CENTRE' engraved on it, indicating to
any explorer that they had reached the halfway point in the maze.
Interest concentrated on that area, but without result.

Julius, knowing that people sometimes left the maze who had not
apparently entering it, even considered the possibility that each
disappearance was matched by an appearance, theorising that a change of
clothes might suffice to conceal a transformation. Again, he could find
nothing in the CCTV records to support that. The incidents of unmatched
entry and exit were, of course, very rare, and never occurred on the
same day.

<p class=drop>Inspector Gordon announced that he intended to enact his
search warrant on the next day. He had obviously discovered that the
labyrinth was the likely nexus of disappearances, as he warned that it
would be closed to the public until his search was complete.

It was time, decided Julius, to interrogate the hermits. He approached
the hermit's cave just as some tourists were leaving. He entered and
brushed past the old man, making for the deeper recesses of the cave.
The hermit stood up and started to bellow, but Julius snapped: "Shut
up, man. Don't you recognise me? We need to talk."

Anthony shrugged and followed him, saying nothing.

Julius sat down on a shelf of rock, and said: "Sit!"

Anthony sat.

"Now, I don't know what you and your colleagues are up to. As far as I
am concerned, you are an attraction in my park, and cheap labour.
However, I think you have your own agenda, and if you don't let me know
what it is, I'll chuck you out."

Long pause. Then: "I'd have to talk to the chief."

"I take it you don't refer to Jehovah."

"No. I'm authorised to admit that I'm a UN employee, but that's it."

"His number."

"What?"

"Your chief's telephone number, please."

"I can call him now."

"Do so."

Half an hour later, Colonel Parker of the UN Alien Affairs Commission
was sitting in the grandeur of Julius's office.

"OK," said Parker, "I take it this is about the missing persons."

"Yes. But first of all, I want to know what the -". He consulted the
Colonel's pale blue ID card "- the UNAAC is doing in my park."

Parker cleared his throat. "We are just keeping a discreet watching
brief. We do it for all substantial alien artifacts on Earth. Of which
there are a considerable number now. We are on
the alert for strange events, and we've seen one or two, I can tell you.
Now, about these disappearances."

"They are not supposed to be public knowledge."

"People talk. We listen."

"OK. Your guys have been keeping an eye on things. What are they telling
you?"

"'Guys'? You spotted the multiple Anthonys."

"I did."

"OK. We think it is probably to do with that maze. Some kind
of matter-transmitter trick. But the Anthonys can't
figure it out. At night, they've been round the place with portable echo
sounders and matter-penetrating radar."

"I've seen them creeping around. By the way, do you need our CCTV
records?"

Parker chuckled. "We've been tapped into your CCTV since day one. We
made sure you'd pick our contractor by pricing it at a loss. You notice
anything else?"

Julius hesitated for a moment before saying: "Appearances?"

"You've been paying attention, haven't you? It's been happening at other
locations where the Altairians have
established publicly accessible buildings. There's the new NASA training
school they set up in Florida, the replacement community centre in China
where that piece of their hardware accidentally fell out of orbit and
killed about fifty old folk, and the seawater desalination plant they
donated to Chile for no obvious reason. And wherever they can donate a
building without arousing suspicion. We think they have some
mechanism for extracting people from these places. And returning them."

"Have you managed to find anyone who reappeared?"

"A few. They are all under surveillance. They don't seem to be
doing anything out of the ordinary. Mostly, the returnees are very
discreet, but one in
particular had been reported missing, and there was a fuss when he came
back. He was one of the early missing persons. It took two years for him
to come back. He claimed to have no memory of his time away. And there's
just one more thing."

"Yes?"

"The guy who came back was not the guy who vanished. Either that, or he
was actually younger than he was when he disappeared. And Einstein says
that's impossible."

"How can you tell?"

"Because just before he vanished he broke his arm in an accident. We had
the X-Rays. When he came back there was no sign of any break. And that's
impossible too."

"So you think..."

"I think they're infiltrating spies among us. The Altairians."

"So where are we? What do I tell people?"

"Face it. If you come out with all this, you'll be regarded as a total screwball.
I'm talking to you because you've found out so much by yourself. You
should act as
mystified as everyone is. Another reason I'm telling <i>you</i> is so
you don't
kick out my Anthonys."

"Am I supposed to tell Inspector Gordon all this? They're doing a search
tomorrow."

"That's yet another reason I'm taking you into my confidence. Say
nothing.
He'll go through the motions, but he won't give you much more trouble. 
He'll probably decide there's stuff missing from your CCTV record. He's
under
pressure from his superiors to look active."

"I see. He's one of yours, is he?"

"Quite the opposite. He's one of theirs. A returnee. How old do you think
he looks?"

"About fifty."

"Inspector Gordon retired from the Hong Kong police about fifteen years
ago. Aged fifty. He dropped out of sight a couple of months later. We think
he arrived in this area shortly after your estate was rebuilt. Just keep
a lid on this, is all we ask. I know it'll be
hard for someone as smart as you, but just act dumb, OK? Besides, we
may have to move against you if we can't trust you."

"Got it. A drop of fifteen-year old Laphroaig, Colonel?"

"Don't mind if I do, Mr McRaven."

[*ITEM] Death plus One

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark

[*BLURB] <b>"Death comes equally to us all, and makes us all equal when
it
comes."</b><br><small>John Donne</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I followed Three Witches down the side
street, keeping to the shadows. It was one of those damp nights where
street lighting served merely to define the darkness rather than provide
illumination - which suited me just fine. They disappeared into the side
entrance of the Cologne Club and as the door opened I caught a brief
burst of the Halloween revels within. Franco Jacoby ran all the major
nightclub action in the Lower East Side and his seasonal-themed parties
were legendary. Tonight, for whatever reason, he’d gone for armed
security over his regular door-minder muscle, contracting out the deal
via a range of intermediaries. So there I was; armed and definitely
dangerous, in fancy dress. </p> <p>A black cat paused in the process of
crossing my path to give me the full hiss-and-glare treatment. Some wise
sage once said cats can see what lies behind your eyes, so felines
really have a downer on me - but I’m used to it by now. It stood its
ground so I ducked under a ladder propped against the side of Dobson’s
Depository, knowing it wouldn’t follow. You may think all this comes
under the heading of ‘Old Wives Tales’ but, trust me, it all depends on
which old wife you listen to.</p>

<p>The young woman on the door looked tasty; all ankle-length coat,
cropped black hair and inset mirrored shades. Light
rain made her black leather shimmer like liquid glass under the neon
‘CC’ sign. I recognised her as Amy Chandler – but then again, I know
everyone. </p>

<p>Amy stiffened as I stepped into a pool of light, so I slid back my
hood to give her a clear look at my face. Her stance relaxed slightly
and she laughed. “Stevens? I heard you were dead. I know you can never
have too much firepower but this is getting ridiculous.” She eyed my
hoodie and cargo pants, shaking her head, “What have you come as anyway?
A modern take on Little Jack Horner?”</p>

<p>I held my arms out at shoulder height and gave her a slow pirouette.
“Justin Timberlake, <i>actually</i>. In full-blown slasher movie mode,
circa Cry Me A River. Anyway, you’re one to talk with this whole Matrix
thing you’ve got going.”</p>

<p>Amy came over all mock-huffy. “It’s a William Gibson homage,
<i>actually</i>. You know, Molly from Neuromancer?”</p>

<p>“Whatever. Look, doll, who else is in on this? The details I have are
a bit sketchy and they said you’d fill me in. All I know is it’s a
bodyguard gig.”</p>

<p>“Well, more a kind of private army. We’ve got Suzy-Sue and Grumman
round front, Bain and Akira inside as close protection.”</p>

<p>“Christ, that’s some serious talent! Who’s this guy afraid of?
Godzilla?”</p>

<p>Amy pursed her lips. “Death.”</p>

<p>I blinked. Twice. “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“Franco Jacoby thinks there’s someone coming to kill him, and they’re
gonna’ come dressed as Death.”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “So why not just cancel the party? A refund has to
work out cheaper than hiring our little band of desperados.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Naw, it’s a machismo thing. Nobody tries to
muscle-in on Jacoby ‘cos he’s our own little Keyser Soze - a real shark
amongst sharks. No way can he afford to appear scared or it would be
like blood in the water. Luckily for us he’s paranoid about being
betrayed by a member of his own crew, so we got the gig.”</p>

<p>“But why just tonight? If there’s a contract out then I don’t see how
delaying the hit for a few hours will matter any.”</p>

<p>Amy frowned. “To tell you the truth this whole thing may be a
complete waste of time. Apparently Jacoby gets like this every
Halloween, like it’s some kind of family ritual. Talk about inherited
superstition, his father must have been a real weirdo.”</p>

<p>I wiped slick rain from my face. “So what you’re telling me, and feel
free to jump right in anytime if I’ve gotten hold of the wrong end of
the stick, is that we’re standing here to stop an imaginary assassin
killing a vicious crime lord who’s jumping at shadows?”</p>

<p>She nodded. ”Pretty much. To tell you the truth, Stevens, Jacoby must
be off his head. If he didn’t have such a reputation I’d have stayed at
home in front of the TV. As it stands he’s not someone I want to piss
off.”</p>

<p>I took up position beside her. “No lie.” She fished a spare earpiece
and lapel microphone from her coat and handed them over. Just as well I
had lapels. I plugged in and squeezed the mic to open the channel.
“Radio check. You all hearing me?” Amy nodded.</p>

<p><i>“Stevens, you little shit, that really you? Heard you was lying
low for the foreseeable. Heard you had a serious beef with Danny O for
screwing his kid sister.”</i> </p>

<p>I recognised the gravel-throated growl of Donald Bain (who never got
the joke). “I love you too, Don. Let’s just say me and Danny came to a
resolution he’s happy with.”</p>

<p>Suzy-Sue laughed. <i>“If this means wedding bells then I just got to
be there. Your side of the church will be packing more firepower than
Omaha Beach.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Enough already! Everyone get back on the clock.”</i> That was
Grumman. The guy must be fifty if he’s a day and always comes over like
he’s in charge whenever gunmen get together.</p>

<p>Amy arched an eyebrow, which made her wince. “You making an honest
woman of Tina <em>O'Shaughnessy</em>, Tony? Say it ain’t so.”</p>

<p>I shrugged and had the good grace to look semi-uncomfortable. “It’s
not what you think.”</p>

<p>“It never is.” She smiled and shifted her stance slightly. Her foot
brushed against a small bag I hadn’t noticed before, producing the soft
<i>clink</i> of glass.</p>

<p>“Boozing on the job, Amy? Or when we knock-off don’t you fancy paying
bar prices inside?”</p>

<p>She glanced down. “Naw, it’s a broken mirror. Didn’t you get one
through the mail from Jacoby? The rest of us did.”</p>

<p>“A broken mirror? What the hell are you on about now?”</p>

<p>“As in seven years bad luck for the poor schmuck who originally broke
it? But luck is like, you know, air – there’s only so much to go around.
So to screw with the intended the mirror has to suck in bad luck from
those in the immediate vicinity. Loads of gamblers and gunmen carry
glass. Don’t you know <i>anything</i>?”</p>

<p>I grinned and shook my head. “Apparently not. Well, our Franco sounds
like he’s a few aces short of a pack.”</p>

<p>Amy snorted. “Yeah, well, you can laugh but there’s a space reserved
for us in Fresh Kills if we fuck this up, so I for one will take any
help going.”</p>

<p>“I hear ya, doll, I hear ya. But ending up as Staten Island landfill
wasn’t what I had in mind for this body, if it’s all the same to
you.”</p>

<p>We stood like mismatched statues on either side of the entrance to a
particular tatty tomb. As nothing was happening in the street I took a
quick look around. “Why is there a line of white powder across the
doorway?”</p>

<p>“Salt. There’s a shaker in the corner should we need to re-establish
the barrier if it gets scuffed.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“You know, its proof against, against…” Her voice trailed away in
obvious embarrassment, “It was on the sheet.”</p>

<p>“Along with the broken mirror that I didn’t get?”</p>

<p>“Screw you.”</p>

<p>An awkward silence descended. We stood. I cleared my throat. “Those
mirror shades, they stuck on?”</p>

<p>She sounded relieved to discuss something other than our situation.
“Yeah, not my best idea. They itch like a bitch.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. The rain continued to fall. I hitched up
my pants as the twin .38 revolvers in the thigh pockets were hanging
heavy. A dispute broke out amongst some crows nesting in the Depository
clock tower. Maybe they were jumping about on the mechanism but it
suddenly chimed once, although everyone knew it got busted years ago.
The domestic spilled out in a flurry of wings and bad-tempered cawing. A
cluster of six crows swept down and along the street, passing close
enough I could have reached out and snagged one. The avian shouting
match faded away into the gloom.</p>

<p>Amy fished something out of her coat pocket and started fiddling with
it. She looked twitchy. “Six crows. That’s bad luck. Means someone is
for the chop.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “Only if we do our job right. What <i>is</i> that you’ve
got anyway?”</p>

<p>“An acorn. Brings good luck.”</p>

<p>“Say what? You’re not superstitious.”</p>

<p>“Tonight I am.” She crammed the nut back into her pocket. “Just leave
it, OK?”</p>

<p>We stood some more. Way in the distance a dog howled. I got bored.
For something to do I turned and checked the guest list on a clipboard
hanging inside the recessed doorway. “Amy, you looked at this?”</p>

<p>“Not as such. It’s only for those who turn up without tickets, and
they generally make a grand entrance round front.” A wary note crept
into her voice. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Its here, right down at the bottom - ‘Death plus one’. A
hand-written addition.”</p>

<p>Amy licked her lips in what I knew to be an uncharacteristic display
of nervousness. “Bullshit. Is this your idea of a joke?”</p>

<p>I held out the clipboard. “See for yourself.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward. “It’s still bullshit. I’m telling ya, Tony,
Jacoby is loony-tunes paranoid tonight and the club is like Fort Knox.
Every window has been bricked up, every chimney sealed. The only way in
is through one of us.”</p>

<p>Movement further down the street caught my attention. I pointed, she
looked. There were two figures approaching, briefly illuminated by each
street light as they walked towards us. One looked like a tall dude,
basketball tall, in a long robe with cowl, face hidden, carrying a
scythe over his shoulder. Beside him was a pale-skinned girl in a
blood-soaked wedding dress, her throat slashed wide open.</p>

<p>Amy shook her head. “Death and The Maiden? You have <i>got</i> to be
kidding me.”</p>

<p>As we watched the couple paused briefly then The Maiden headed off
down an alleyway in the direction of Regency. Death watched her go then
started towards us again. It was just an optical illusion but it looked
like the rain parted and fell either side of the scythe blade, as if it
were keen enough to cleave the very air itself.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. “Okey-dokey. Let’s not get
ahead of ourselves here. Say she’s gone to score an ATM or liquor store
while he heads inside to get in line for the buffet. Hell, they might
not even be guests at this particular party.”</p>

<p>“You really think that, Tony? Really?” My partner squared her
shoulders. “I say we take no chances. I say we off him, no questions
asked.”</p>

<p>“No way. This has to be a guest.”</p>

<p>“Yes way, bro. Jacoby holds this party every Halloween, never missed
a year since ever, and the invites stipulate absolutely no Death
costumes. Anything else you might fancy, but not that.”</p>

<p>“Shit, you can’t just kill someone for not reading the small print.
Anyway, I figure <i>this</i> dude is on the guest list.” I tossed the
clipboard aside and stepped out in front of the Grim Reaper, hands
raised. “Excuse me, pal, but-”</p>

<p>The scythe went one way, a glittering distraction, Death another. He
spun, robes flying wide, and kicked me in the chest. A solid hit, one
that sent me sprawling on my back, hands clawing at the thigh pockets of
my cargo pants. He leapt into the air, paused in a slo-mo moment, and
came down - his heel aimed at my throat.</p>

<p>I tore both .38’s free and started firing, nailing him multiple times
in the chest. The impacts seemed to dissipate his momentum and he
dropped short, landing at my feet, taking hit after hit without
reaction.</p>

<p>Both my revolvers clicked empty.</p>

<p>Death shook himself and a cluster of spent rounds dropped to the
ground. He laughed; not a dry-as-dust cackle, but a rich, basso profundo
chuckle that somehow sounded more unsettling. I scrabbled in the dirt,
trying to push myself away, but my shoulders came up against a wheeled
trash bin and I was trapped. He towered over me, the very picture of
inhuman fatality.</p>

<p>“Hey, dickhead.” Amy sounded wired, brittle, high on violence.</p>

<p>He half turned towards the voice.</p>

<p>“Eat this!”</p>

<p>A shotgun roared, real loud in the narrow street, echoing off the
walls. Death took it full in the face. His cowl vanished in a blizzard
of shredded cloth and blood. He fell back in a bloody sprawl and lay
still.</p>

<p>My saviour stepped up, her long coat now flapping open, holding a
pump-action Mossberg 500 with pistol grip. Amy kept the prone figure
covered while I got to my feet and peered down at what remained of the
body. I frowned. “He had a face? How can Death have a face? Isn’t he
supposed to be, you know, just bones?”</p>

<p>Amy shrugged. “Beats me, bro. Here, hold this while I finish things
off.” She tossed me the shotgun which I managed to catch and not drop.
Fishing inside her vest top she produced a big medallion, with five
spiky corners, slipping the chain over her head.</p>

<p>I laughed, sounding nervous. “Didn’t know you were into that kind of
mojo, doll.”</p>

<p>She crouched down and started scratching out a pentagram around the
body, the medallion leaving deep lines in the tarmac. “Doesn’t matter
what I believe, bro. According to our employer this will keep him safe
for another year and I’m not going to argue.”</p>

<p>I kept watch while she shuffled around the body, completing the
occult symbol. None of the other hired help came to our aid and I didn’t
expect them to. They’d keep station in case the gunfire was just a
diversion. The club soundproofing was primo so the revellers would be
none the wiser about our little fracas.</p>

<p>Amy sat back on her haunches. “There, done. Now I place this
whatever-it-is on his chest and we can make tracks. Don’t sweat about
the police showing up, Jacoby has paid them to stay well away tonight.”
She tossed the medallion onto the corpse which landed with a metallic
<i>click</i>.</p>

<p>We looked at each other. I shrugged. She frowned and reached forward
to move a fold of robe aside. “Body armour? What the hell does Death
need with body armour?”</p>

<p>I chambered another round, the <i>rak-rak</i> sounding harsh - and
final. Amy jumped to her feet, hand clawing for the Glock on her hip,
and I shot her square in the chest. The short-range impact spun her
around before she collapsed in an ungainly heap.</p>

<p>There was a silence as if the world held its breath.</p>

<p>Franco Jacoby was seriously twisted, and then some. Every Halloween
he took out an anonymous contract on <i>himself</i>, stipulating it had
to take place at the Cologne Club. You pay enough money and even a
hardened killer will wear a pink tutu and whistle ‘Dixie’ while blowing
someone away. </p>

<p>Or in this case, turn up dressed like the Grim Reaper, complete with
scythe.</p>

<p>The hit man had to have a proven track record; he had to be someone
who’d killed multiple times before. Same went for the bodyguards Jacoby
hired – all people on first-name terms with Death. Every Halloween
someone died, and every Halloween a clean-up crew made it like nothing
happened.</p>

<p>This year, though, was different. Jacoby’s daughter had just turned
21 and now needed ‘protection’ as well. Well, that’s what her father
believed and you can’t argue with a sick mind. So I was the ringer
brought in to ensure that <i>two</i> corpses ended up in the pentagram,
by any means necessary. </p>

<p>I heard high-heels and turned to face The Maiden – a.k.a. the love of
my life, Tina O'Shaughnessy. She stared at the faceless Death for a
moment, then spat on the corpse. “Bastard. I hope you rot in Hell,
Danny.”</p>

<p>As epitaphs go maybe her brother deserved better, but I’ve
learned never to get between family. Except, of course, on this occasion
I had; Danny O had a downer on me and Tina from the get-go, end of
story. I couldn’t do nothing as he was a Made Man with the Scharlach
family - and even if we’d just skipped town it wouldn’t have ended
there. </p>

<p>So I got him the Jacoby gig, moonlighting as Death, with Amy as
the designated target. Now, OK, I’d planned to pop him once he dropped
her, but his double-cross still <i>hurt</i>, man. Seriously. It’s a sad
reflection on society when you can’t trust a hired killer.</p>

<p>I pressed my lapel mic. “Splash one Zero…and one friendly. We’re
clear.” Nobody answered; everybody knew the risks that came with a gig
like this. I handed Tina the shotgun. “This won’t take a minute, doll,
then we’re free and clear.”</p>

<p>Tina had grown up in the life and this wasn’t her first multiple
murder. She chambered a fresh round and stood, hand on hip, as I dragged
Amy on top of the other body. From an inside pocket I took a hip flask
and poured the contents onto the scored tarmac. It flowed more like
thick oil than regular booze and smelled like cinnamon. Jacoby had
supplied it and no way was I taking a sip to find out if it was actually
alcoholic. It took almost a minute to mark out the pentagram with lines
that shimmered like quicksilver under the halogen streetlight. </p>

<p>I stepped back, fished out a book of matches, struck one and
tossed it. Pale blue flames flared up, burned for less than five
seconds, and were gone like someone turned the gas off. I stood back and
wiped rain from my face. </p>

<p>Tina sniffed. “We cool?”</p>

<p>“We’re cool. Some unknown guy shows up and gets the drop on Amy.
I open fire but he’s wearing body armour, the real deal. But the impacts
make him stagger back, he drops the shotgun. I get to it first
and…”</p>

<p>“Goodnight, Vienna.” She nodded. “You never saw his face, you
never realised who it was.”</p>

<p>I grinned. “Nope. No idea.”</p>

<p>She kissed me, careful not to get fake blood on my clothes, and
handed back the Mossberg. “Call me.”</p>

<p>I watched as she faded into the shadows; trying for a bit of
bump-and-grind but she doesn’t have the hips for it. Then I switched the
microphone to channel 2. “Mister Jacoby? This is Stevens. You can send
in that clean-up crew anytime now.”</p>

<p>A rasping drawl. “It’s done? Two bodies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir-” The Depository bell tolled twice, making me pause. I
cleared my throat.</p>

<p>“Death plus one.”</p>
