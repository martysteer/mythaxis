[*BLURB] <b>Welcome to the 20th issue of Mythaxis.</b>
 
[*DESCRIPTION] <p class =drop>Thank you to all contributors, and welcome
to the August 2017 issue of Mythaxis.

It is a continuing delight to me that original stories still appear in
my in-tray. 

Each issue gets about 3000 unique visitors, who make an average of two
visits, and each visitor looks at an average of six stories.

Authors first published in Mythaxis have gone on to be published
elsewhere. If you like the stories in Mythaxis, make sure to tell your
friends and social media, and extend the readership.

I have been reviewing my sf library lately, and I am struck by the fact
that many of the 1950s pioneers of science fiction are now almost
forgotten. Alfred Bester, James Blish, Eric Frank Russell, Damon Knight,
Henry Kuttner, Pohl and Kornbluth, Poul Anderson, Roger Zelazny, to name
but a few. I recently re-read Zelazny's <i>Lord of Light</i> - a
dazzlingly original novel, somewhat eclipsed these days by his Courts of
Chaos series, which, however entertaining, pales by comparison.
And then there is Bester's <i>Tiger, Tiger</i> and Blish's <i>Cities in
Space</i> series.

Happily, we still have my favourites - William Gibson and Bruce
Sterling. David Mitchell hovers as a bridge between mainstream and
fantasy, as does Nick Harkaway. I much mourn the demise at the age
of just fifty-nine of Iain M Banks, but his oeuvre deserves a re-read.
Within the last year, I've read <i>Matter</i>, <i>Player of Games</i>
and <i>Consider Phlebas</i>.

So, it is to be hoped that the next decade's author is lurking in the
(HTML) pages of Mythaxis. I certainly feel there is considerable talent
here. Read on, and enjoy.

[*BLURB] <b>"You can have too much minimalism, you know"</b><br> Gil
Williamson
 
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>“He still looks crabby.” </p>

<p>“Brawk from Research says that’s one of his three natural
expressions: basically, preoccupied, sullen and unconvinced. According
to Brawk it’s difficult to distinguish one from the others.”</p>
								 
<p>“These quizzicists are trained to be sceptical, I suppose.”</p>
								 
<p>“He usually avoids interviews. I wonder what made him agree to this
one.”</p>						 
								 
<p>“You mean apart from Tessany’s charm and good looks?”</p>
								 
<p>“And considerable skill. You have to admit she’s damn good at her
job.”</p>						 
								 
<p>“I know. I see the ratings. She’s irreplaceable.”</p>
								 
<p>“Let’s hope she can get him to explain… hang on, I think Twilene’s
finished with him. We’re about to go live.”</p>
								 
<p>Twilene Moach from Cosmetics had indeed completed her emollient
ministrations and had </p>		 
								 
<p>packed away her array of brushes and powders, leaving her latest
subject looking, under her expert camouflage, unthreateningly stoical.
</p>							 
								 
<p>Tessany Flume flashed him a reassuring smile, and turned to the
quietly hovering camera.</p>	 
								 
<p>“Hello again. Well, I hope you all enjoyed as much as I did those
nostalgic tales of the stage from Trafford Croles. I’m Tessany Flume,
and I’m delighted to introduce as my next guest this evening a
distinguished scientist, a quizzicist greatly respected by his peers,
but by the very nature of his work, perhaps less well-known to you at
home: Professor Sivid Padratheleon. Welcome, Professor, and thank you
for joining me on ‘Tessa’s Guests’.”</p>
								 
<p>“Pleased to be here,” murmured Padratheleon, as sincerely as his
temperament would allow.</p>	 
								 
<p>“Now, a few background details for our viewers. You are currently the
Heliard Professor of Theoretical Quizzics at Platport University. And
your wife Preen, also a mathematician, has turned to sculpture…?</p>
								 
<p>“She constructs intersecting lattices, yes.” </p>
								 
<p>The muscles around his mouth flexed into what may have been smile,
but it was not easy to tell whether he regarded this arcane pursuit with
secret pride, or even approval. </p>
								 
<p>“And I believe your daughter is a choreographer?”</p>
								 
<p>“She dances, yes.”</p>		 
								 
<p>Sensing that he was growing impatient, Tessany Flume decided to move
on swiftly.</p>					 
								 
<p>“I’m told that you have formulated a theory which you say is of major
importance to our understanding of the universe.”</p>
								 
<p>“That is corrrect.”</p>		 
								 
<p>“And if I might paraphrase one of your colleagues, this theory is so…
bold and innovative that it opens up a totally new area of science.”</p>
								 
<p>“Indeed so.”</p>				 
								 
<p>“Would it be possible, Professor, for the benefit of those of us less
familiar with advanced mathematics, for you to give us an insight into
your thinking, in terms that the general public might understand?”</p>
								 
<p>“Probably not.”</p>			 
								 
<p>“But Pr...”</p>				 
								 
<p>“But I will try.” The craggy face contrived to display tolerant
amusement, without conspicuous success. </p>
								 
<p>“Quizzicists are concerned with the nature and properties of matter
and energy. Significant advances in our understanding occur as the
result of a process of continuous questioning, which of course is why
the subject is known as Quizzics. Keeping an open mind is not easy. It
is a facility too often lost after childhood, and particularly difficult
to recover once we have been indoctrinated with a traditionally
piecemeal system of knowledge. However, as a theoretician I have found
it more pertinent to question our basic assumptions, rather than
squabble over additions to a structure whose foundations we have only
assumed to be unshakable.”</p>	 
								 
<p>Tessany Flume knew better than to interrupt a guest in full flow.</p>
								 
<p>“There are limits to what we can observe, even though we have devised
increasingly sensitive instruments to extend the reach of our senses,
but mathematics provides us with tools that can transcend these limits,
exploring regions which would otherwise be inaccessible. I am speaking
here of the very stuff of which the universe is composed. My equations
indicate the existence of a set of unimaginably small.… what for the
sake of simplicity I shall describe as particles, which bind and
permeate everything.”</p>		 
								 
<p>“That’s extraordinary, Professor. You say <i>unimaginably small.</i>
Does that mean there would be no way of actually confirming the
existence of these.. <i>particles</i>, other than mathematically?”</p>
								 
<p>“I am not an engineer. It may be possible in future to develop some
kind of sophisticated apparatus by means of which one or more of the set
of ‘particles’ may be detected, most likely by inference, provided that
sufficiently controlled conditions could be achieved. They exist on a
scale and in a realm utterly invisible to us, ghostly presences
underpinning the whole of our reality. Of all fields of scientific study
I think this must qualify as the most fundamental.”</p>
								 
<p>“Then may I ask you, as the pioneer in this field, what we are to
call it?”</p>					 
								 
<p>“You may call it whatever you wish, Miss Flume.”</p>
								 
<p>“That’s commendably modest of you, Professor, but surely such a major
advance deserves to be given a name by its discoverer.”</p>
								 
<p>He frowned, considering the implications of letting others – perhaps
ill-informed detractors, suggest something flippant or totally
inappropriate. The corners of Professor Padratheleon’s mouth again
twitched imperceptibly.</p>		 
								 
<p>“Well, until my conjectures can be verifed experimentally…”</p>
								 
<p>Padrathelion closed his eyes, focussing on the equations which drove
his haunting subatomic vision of an infinite seething field of what,
from a certain perspective, might seem to be intersecting lattices.</p>
								 
<p>“I suppose it would have to be ‘Phantom Quizzics’.”</p>

[*ITEM] The Drill Hall Incident

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson
													 
[*BLURB] <b>“The unassuming youth seeking instruction with humility
gains good fortune.”</b><br> I Ching
 
[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Matt Davidson had lived in Edinburgh for
most of his adult life; he had walked past the Drill Hall's
unprepossessing entry a hundred times. It was a short, dark, lane
running between tenement buildings, paved with the grey cobbles that
still abounded in many run-down corners of the city.
The lane was just wide enough for a single large vehicle. Scrapes on
the walls of the lane indicated that it had proved too narrow for some.
Matt entered the lane, automatically noting the smells of used beer,
urine and vomit which such a Saturday night haven inevitably attracted.
The lane ended a few metres in, at a huge double door in a featureless
wall. A wicket gate and a new entry phone were set into the right hand
double door. <div class=pullquote>“Before the beginning of great brilliance, there must be chaos. Before
a brilliant person begins something great, they must look foolish in the
crowd.”<br> I Ching</div>
 
Now, having checked the address in his iPda and read the tiny notice on
the door's flaking green paint, he pressed the bell push on the entry
speaker. The speaker hummed for a second, and Matt drew breath to
announce himself, only to be interrupted by an impatient voice saying:
"It's open!".

The "Drill Hall" wasn't so much a building as a  contained space, a
tapered quadrilateral about half the area of a football field.
White-painted brick walls without windows rose to an impressive height.
Around the perimeter were iron columns, patterned after the classical
style, sprouting at their capitals a remarkably intricate tracery of
iron frames, the support for a domed glass roof. Most of the panes were
the original glass, totally obscured  by the soot of decades of
Edinburgh smoke. Students of Victorian railway stations would recognise
the architectural style. Fluorescent strip lights dangled from cables
strung across the width of the building. In the centre of the hall
lurked a jumble of heavy machinery.

A lean middle-aged man with a couple of day's growth of beard was
walking towards him. "Calvin Yelland," he said. "You'll be Davidson."

"Yes, Professor." They shook hands. Yelland's was wrinkled, cold, dry.

"Graduate Research Assistant Matthew Davidson," said Yelland, with the
unfocussed look of one quoting from a remembered document, "Four years
of university, resulting in an impressive degree in Oriental Studies.
Hardly ideal for an pioneering physics project in a cold laboratory, one
might think, and a strange decision from you, I dare say, but <i>we</i>
want a non-scientist for a change, while <i>you</i>, according to your
application, want something completely different. Welcome to the
fridge."

Matt couldn't be sure whether Yelland's sour expression was for himself
or for the building. "I... Er... Unusual location."

"We're lucky to have it. Lots of room, but it isn't ideal, either.
Damned cold, roof leaks, and it was full of junk you wouldn't believe
when we got here, but no rats at least. They probably have more sense.
Belongs to the University."

"Really?"

"Oh, yes," Yelland's gaze became distracted again as he appeared to
visualise another remembered document. "Originally built in the late
1800s as an off-site lecture hall, but it has hopelessly echoing
acoustics and was only used for one semester. The Natural Philosophy
department has sporadically rented it out since 1890. It's been used as
a church hall by various religions and denominations, as a museum
warehouse, a dance hall, a variety theatre, a stable for the Co-op draft
horses in the 1930s - hence the faint dung heap aroma - a cinema, and,
during World War 2, as the HQ of a Royal Signals regiment. That's when
it was first called 'The Drill Hall'. Most recently it's been an indoor
karting track - hence the lingering air of petrol fumes  and burnt
rubber - a five-a-side football court, and a karate studio. I gather
that in none of its many rôles has it proved ideal."

"I see. Cold, though, as you say."

"It's heated, to an extent, by these massive iron radiators, powered by
an oil-fired furnace that seems have been salvaged from a scrapped ocean
liner. But the volume of the building and the single-glazed glass roof
means that it never feels anything but desperately cold unless you're
actually leaning on a radiator... " His manner cheered a little, "No
need for air conditioning, though, even in summer. One of the previous
tenants built a few hutches for offices around half a dozen radiators at
the back. They're warmer. Come." 

<p class=drop>Two offices were busy with several young men debating
equations on whiteboards, another with two older men in overalls
surrounded by racks of equipment. Two offices appeared to be filled with
machine tools. Yelland and Matt entered a near-vacant office, which was
only half full of equipment, leaving room for a desk and a couple of
chairs.

"You know what we're doing here," said Yelland, but with a question in
his voice.

"I gather it's some kind of physics research. Eh, quantum something.
Black holes. 'Exotic', the notification said."

"Hmm..." Yelland almost smiled. "Refreshing to speak to someone who
isn't either totally convinced or thoroughly sceptical. Yes, it's
original research. Wormholes in multi-dimensional space. The future of
faster-than-light space exploration, time travel and other science
fictional dreams. Look up the Wikipedia article on wormholes. Let me
know if you understand it.

"It is not widely known," Yelland continued, "that, last year, using an
amazing amount of energy, a research team at Caltech created a wormhole
a few millimetres in width and about a metre in length. Nevertheless,
this tiny hole nearly killed the researchers and destroyed a laboratory,
because the other end of the  wormhole was in the vacuum of space, and
naturally began to suck the air out of the lab. Luckily, the wormhole
closed down, pinched off. They usually do."

"How was the other end in space if it was only a metre long? This is a
silly question, isn't it?" said Matt.

"Not really, and the answer may clarify what our problem is here. A
wormhole connects two points in space-time, and we tend to think of
space as regularly structured as we experience it in our lives, but a
wormhole spans space in a totally different fashion. In principle,
looking through a one metre wormhole, you might perceive something that
is half a million miles and a year away in our space-time, and it would
appear to be just one metre away at the other end of the hole. Though,
in reality, a view through a wormhole would necessarily be misleading."

"And my situation here?"

"First, there's a lot of reading to do, some mathematics to learn.
Nothing too taxing, and the young Fountain here will help you. But we
need someone to observe what we're doing, and to make sense of it. The
rest of us are too busy with the technology. There's a PhD in it for you
if you make a success of it. You see, I've read some of your essays on
oriental culture, beliefs and customs, and you have a proven and rare
ability clearly to communicate alien ideas, such as Zen, Confucianism
and the Book of Changes, for example, to readers like myself with no
background in the subject. You are to be the eyes, ears and voice of the
project."

<p class = drop>Matt buried himself in mathematics, from which he
learned little, and read primers on special and general relativity,
which stretched his ability to visualise space and time.<div
 class=pullquote>“Perseverance alone does not assure success. No amount of stalking will
lead to game in a field that has none.”<br> I Ching</div>

Every couple of days, the gas turbine would be started, generating,
according to the engineers, enough electricity to supply a small city.
The generator was a bulky green machine which lurked like a giant toad,
as high as a man, against one wall. The Drill Hall briefly warmed up as
the jet exhaust glowed red hot, and the noise was enormous, despite the
fact that the exhaust was directed in a pipe up the wall and outside.
The resulting electric power was directed into the Wormhole Reactor, an
even larger machine shaped ike a cotton reel, basically a fat cylinder
the diameter of a railway tunnel with a one metre hollow space down its
centre.

On a good day, a sparkling sphere the size of a grape would blink into
existence just inside the hollow for a moment. The entrance, Matt was
told, to a wormhole. A sphere, because it was a three-dimensional hole
in multi-dimensional space-time. These unimpressive phenomena gave
immense satisfaction to the physicists. Matt learned that these
wormholes were the largest, by a factor of a thousand, that had ever
been created anywhere in the world, and that their short flicker
represented a thousand-fold lengthening of their existence, wormholes
being inclined to collapse very quickly.

And so it continued for some months, the climate in the Drill Hall
gradually softening from arctic to mere terribly cold, and moisture
condensing on metal surfaces so that alarming elecric arcs accompanied
the powering up of the Reactor, snaking around the cylinder until it
heated up. Pools of water accumulated around the bases of the pillars.
Drips from the glass ceiling spattled on the turbine exhaust, causing
little clouds of steam. The tiny spheres appearing in the cylinder were
sometimes larger, often longer-lived, than Matt had originally seen, but
as the project seemed to be in <i>stasis</i>, he began to show signs of
discontent and doubt over his decision to join the project. Only
Yelland, Fountain - one of the young physicists, Gazzer the technician
and Matt himself turned up on a regular basis.

<p class=drop>Then came the breakthrough. Fountain attempted a
re-formulation of the equations they were using. Yelland and he noisily
disputed the validity of Fountain's idea for days, covering the
whiteboard in symbols, crossings-out and parenthetic notes. Eventually,
in face of the slow progress they had been making, Yelland agreed to
give it a try, despite the fact that it would require a partial rebuild
of the Reactor and re-programming of the cybernetic control
functions.<div class=pullquote>“When the way comes to an end, then change. Having changed, you pass
through.”<br> I Ching</div>

The scientists and engineers turned out in full force, overnights and
weekends being worked. Yet it took a full six weeks to make the changes.

In the meantime, excess to requirements, Matt seized the opportunity to
take a two-week vacation in Beijing, studying documents and artifacts he
had previously only known at second hand. He therefore returned to
the
Drill Hall refreshed and enthusiastic. The Wormhole Reactor had
sprouted
a few more bulges and cables, and there were signs of extensive surgery
in a ring around the edge of the outer cylinder.

For the first three weeks, the remodelled Reactor appeared
totally useless, and not even the little ephemeral spheres appeared. The
other researchers and one of the engineers drifted away from the
project. Yelland spent much of his time moping in his office.

Then Fountain discovered what he called a 'schoolboy error' in the
cybernetic program.

At the next test of the new Reactor, the sphere representing the
wormhole entrance was much larger than any previous, and it persisted
until the Reactor was switched off.

In great excitement, some adjustments were made and the Reactor powered
up again. Matt couldn't follow the details of the activity, but he could
see the glimmering sphere getting bigger at each attempt, and it showed
no sign of collapse while power was applied.

A few days later, a maximum size appeared to have been reached. The
sphere was by then about the size of a grapefruit. Fountain was
particularly triumphant, Yelland somewhat gratified. Cameras clicked,
measurements were taken. The wormhole entrance glowed.

<p class=drop>A Monday morning in August, daylight struggling through
the glass roof, and the air tingling with anticipation, the Reactor was
fired up for a serious test run. Serious it might be, yet it was
primitive in its aims.<div class=pullquote>“The responses of human beings vary greatly under dangerous
circumstances. The strong man advances boldly to meet them head on. The
weak man grows agitated. But the superior man stands up to fate, endures
resolutely in his inner certainty <br> I Ching</div>

Fountain took a wooden ruler and pushed it cautiously at the sphere,
making sure that his fingers stayed outside. The
ruler disappeared into the surface of the sphere, but did not emerge
from the opposite side. He withdrew it carefully. It appeared
intact.
It was a weird sight. The longest piece of wood that could readily be
found was a walking stick. It proved possible to push it into the sphere
so that it disappeared to nearly its full length and to withdraw it
again, unharmed.

"If it's connected to somewhere distant, why can we not see that distant
place?" Matt asked Yelland, as they contemplated the sphere.

"Unfortunately," Yelland replied, "the exotic material that lines the
wormhole and keeps it open attracts any photons that come through from
the other side and scatters the image, so it will always be out of
focus."

"So why don't we send a camera through and record what's there?"

Yelland stared at him. It was clear he hadn't thought of it. "Anyone got
a smartphone and selfie stick?" he called.

Gazzer the engineer obliged, but when the camera was withdrawn, the
image was just as blurred as the sphere.

"C'mon. Any more ideas?"

"How about sending a cat through?" suggested Fountain.

"It's a bit tight," said Matt. "We could send a mouse down."

It took just half an hour to fetch a couple of white mice from the
University's Easter Road pharmaceutical lab. Matt made a little harness
and lead from a length of thin electrical wire. The mouse slipped easily
into the sphere, disappeared and pulled the lead a short distance
further, then stopped for a while, and finally reappeared, apparently
none the worse.

Emboldened by the mouse's survival, Matt stepped forward and poked a
tentative finger into the sphere. Yelland shouted "Careful! You
could
lose the finger if it collapsed!"

Matt withdrew the finger. "I expected it to tingle, but it didn't.
Nothing at all, really." He pushed his whole hand in.

"No, no. Careful!" said Yelland, but he made no move to stop him.

"How long is this wormhole, anyway?" Matt asked.

"We don't know exactly," said Fountain, "Could be anything from a few
centimetres to a few light-years. The quantum calculations are typically
non-specific as to their solution."

"Ok," said Matt, "what say I reach a bit further?"

"Well..." said Fountain.

Matt took a deep breath and thrust his hand and forearm deeper. "Feels
smooth, a little above room temperature. I'm twiddling my fingers. Yes,
it's slightly slippery, and quite straight. I can't feel any passage of
air. I'll just..." He withdrew the arm and stripped off his pullover and
shirt.

"Are you sure?" said Yelland, though it was clear that he and Fountain
were no longer going to dissuade Matt.

Matt pushed his arm back in, cautiously this time, past the elbow.
"Mmm... No change, it's... Ow!" He jerked and pulled back a bit. The
other
two jumped as well.

"What?"

"I felt something. It moved. I'm just trying again. Yes. It's still
there." It feels like... Weird."

Yelland and Fountain were staring aghast. "Weird? What is it? Metal?
Plastic?
What temperature?" asked Yelland.

"It's, ah, like... flesh, really."

"What?"

<div class=pullquote>“If one is not extremely careful, Somebody may
come up from behind and
strike him. Misfortune.”<br> I Ching</div>
"Yes. Yes. It's a hand, and it's moving again. Just feeling it. It's a
human hand all right! I'm clasping it. Wait. I think it's my
<I>own</I> hand! I'm shaking hands with myself! I'm reaching a little
further. Yes. I can feel my wristwatch, and I can feel the other hand
feeling my watch. It's a loop, isn't it?"

Stunned silence. Fountain and Yelland looked at each other.

"Yes, it is," said Yelland. "We must take another look at these
equations. Congratulations, Fountain, I think we've just built the first
multi-dimensional M&ouml;bius doughnut."

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark
													 
[*BLURB] <b>“We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough
men stand ready to do violence on our behalf"</b><br>George Orwell
 
[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>“Burn them!”</p>

<p>I looked up, alerted by the obvious stress in Captain Memphre’s
voice. He stood at the forward view screen, silhouetted against the
blue-green planet, gripping the guard rail so tight his knuckles had
turned white. The south pole of Jetter lay beneath us – a planet home to
some nine-hundred thousand unsuspecting colonists. </p>

<p>Use of the stellar convertor had to be authorised by two senior
officers. However Commander Lutyens was in an induced coma – being
treated for Taig Parasites – and Sub-Commander Devon was on
compassionate leave following the sudden death of his wife. By rights we
should have returned to Cathay Station to take on replacements, but the
Admiralty were keen to see their new toy in action. That left me, a mere
lieutenant, as acting Executive Officer aboard the experimental
terraformer <i>Vulcan</i>.</p>

<p>I was known as a man who obeyed orders, who followed the chain of
command. Without hesitation I moved to the control console and placed my
right palm on the recognition scanner, causing the access panel to
retract. Rotating the revealed T-piece handle through one-eighty degrees
engaged the pre-ignition sequence. </p>

<p>Memphre strode towards me, his voice distorted by fury. “I said burn
them, Keppler! Burn them <i>now!</i>” He slapped his hand down on the
second recognition panel.</p>

<p><i>“Warning, thermostellar primer system is now operational.”</i></p>

<p>“Awaiting full power, sir.” I was conscious of the other bridge
personnel staring at me, but no-one said anything. My board went green.
“Capacitors charged. Firing in three, two, one…” I pulled the T-piece
down and pushed home. A cobalt-blue beam lanced from our bow, causing
the view screen to polarize. It seemed to take an eternity as Jetter
wasn’t an ideal target for conversion, but in reality it was less than a
minute. The beam shut down, leaving a black after-image on my
retinas.</p>

<p>“Energisation cycle complete, Captain.” </p>

<p>He made no reply, staring at the pink hue now spreading through the
ionosphere. We had only a few moments to get clear but he seemed lost in
his own private world. </p>

<p>I raised my voice slightly. “Helm, full astern.”</p>

<p>“Helm answering full astern, sir.” Banks sounded relieved to be
receiving orders from someone, anyone.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat. “Captain Memphre?” He continued to ignore me.
The planet began to glow, changing from pink to pearl-white. “Captain, I
must protect the bridge against the anticipated radiation surge.” Still
he stood there, quivering, like a statue hewn from anguish. I brought
down the heavy view-port blast shields, shutting out the rapidly
increasing glare.</p>

<p>Abruptly Memphre turned on his heel and hurried from the bridge. His
face was pinched, as if in great pain, and there were obvious sweat
stains soiling his uniform. After the door closed behind him no one
spoke for a long moment. </p>

<p>I stood and walked over to the command chair, but did not sit down.
“As senior officer present I will take the con. Miss King, kindly note
this in the log. Also inform Medical that the Captain is, ah, indisposed
and that Commander Lutyens must be revived immediately.”</p>

<p>“Sir.”</p>

<p>The Captain hadn’t explained why we’d altered course to Jetter and
no-one on board had questioned his decision. Everyone knew him to be a
loyal and dependable officer, if a tad staid. Although his fitness for
command had to be questioned I knew the other officers would accept	only
Lutyens as his replacement. </p>

<p>My fingers tapped out a two-two rhythm on the chair back. “Mister
Harris. Sensor readings?”</p>

<p>“Stellar ignition confirmed, <i>Lieutenant</i>.” Sub-Lieutenant
Harris didn’t sound at all happy. “This is now officially a binary star
system and everyone on the former planet is dead.”</p>

<p>I nodded, betraying no emotion. “Any survivors elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“None detected. There was no asteroid mining, no outposts on other
planets or Jetter’s moons. It was a world of no strategic value.”</p>

<p>“Are we clear of the estimated corona?”</p>

<p>Harris shrugged. “Probably, but it hardly matters. You do realise our
careers are finished? You do realise we’ve just murdered nine-hundred
thousand people?”</p>

<p>I ignored him. “Navigation, I want the nearest uninhabited location
from where we can re-establish contact with the Admiralty.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have the next scheduled waypoint still queued up. A
type-seven asteroid, flight time five hours.”</p>

<p>“Lay in the co-ordinates. Helm, get us out of here immediately your
board is green.”</p>

<p>“Alignment….complete. Jumping to hyperspace in three, two, one…”</p>

<p>I experienced that all-too-familiar nausea as <i>Vulcan</i> exited
the real universe. I sat down, although the command chair made me feel
awkward, an imposter. No one spoke. I busied myself tidying up a few
security loose ends until the end of watch, when Reynolds relieved me.
He appeared hesitant, almost fearful of assuming command, so I guessed
word of what had  happened had already spread throughout the ship. </p>

<p>I retreated to my cabin, threw myself down on the bulk fully clothed,
and slept.</p>

<p class=drop>Seven hours later I arose, showered, shaved and donned a
fresh uniform. Silence greeted me as I entered the Wardroom, and none
of my fellow officers would look me in the eye. To spare them any
embarrassment I sat alone as the orderly served me breakfast. I tried to
tune out the background murmur of conversation in case my name cropped
up, instead concentrating on my pad and the schedule of forthcoming
tasks.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across my table and I looked up to see Master Sergeant
Deluca and two Marines, all sporting sidearms. He saluted. “Lieutenant
Keppler, Acting-Captain Lutyens wishes to see you in his quarters. That
would be immediately, sir.”</p>

<p>I dapped my lips with a napkin and stood. “Of course, Top, I
understand.”</p>

<p>Deluca led the way with the two Marines following close behind.
Although the title ‘Acting-Captain’ indicated events had moved ahead
while I’d been asleep, the situation caused me no concern. The Marines
remained on guard outside the Captain’s quarters while Deluca knocked
and ushered me inside.</p>

<p>Lutyens had installed himself behind Memphre’s antique wooden desk,
which had been swept clear of all personal items and mementos. The
acting-captain looked ghastly. Taig Parasites produced a form of
unbearable neuralgia which required the patient to be placed in an
induced coma. Quite how Lutyens had become infected remained a mystery.
He was clearly still suffering; the right side of his body twitched
spasmodically despite the line of derms plastered to his jugular. The
man was mainlining painkillers and I wondered
how badly they’d affected his judgment.</p>

<p>Both Deluca and I stopped the regulation three paces in front of his
desk and saluted. Lutyens ignored the formalities. “Captain Memphre is
dead. He shot himself in the shower.” His eyes flicked to the restroom
door and back to me. “Medical can’t tell if he suffered some kind of
mental breakdown or was exposed to a psychotropic drug. It hardly
matters now.”</p>

<p>I cleared my throat. “Sir, I-”</p>

<p>“Silence!” Lutyens wiped his mouth with a hand that trembled. “I’ve
been in communication with the Admiralty and they’ve placed me in
temporary command. Needless to say our terraforming mission has been
aborted and we’re returning to Cathay Station under escort once the
cruiser Pericles joins us. Consider yourself under arrest, Keppler.
You’ll be confined to quarters for the remainder of the voyage, pending
formal charges.”</p>

<p>“Charges, sir?”</p>

<p>Lutyens had never liked me and managed a thin-lipped smile despite
his obvious pain. “Obeying an illegal order. Crimes against humanity.
For starters.”</p>

<p>“Sir, with respect, neither of those offences are recognised as such
by the Naval Judiciary.”</p>

<p>“<i>Silence!</i> Good God, man, this ship wiped out almost a million
colonists, an entire planet. Didn’t you realise Captain Memphre had
taken leave of his senses?” </p>

<p>I drew myself up. “Sir, I was following the direct orders of my
superior officer.”</p>

<p>“You’re a bloody martinet, Keppler, a mere functionary, but that
won’t save you.” He sat back. “You’ve no friends on board as far as I’m
aware, so don’t expect anyone to speak up on your behalf.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir, but I look forward to standing before a
court-martial and defending myself against-”</p>

<p>The Acting-Captain cut me off. “A court-martial? Do you really think
the Admiralty want the embarrassment of a trial? As least Memphre had
the good sense to kill himself, and I’m sure you’ll also do the decent
thing before we reach port. That’s a prediction by the way, not just my
hopeful expectation. Master Sergeant-”</p>

<p>I took a deep breath. “Computer. Voiceprint identification, Keppler,
Michael. Authentication code, The Trumpets of Jericho.”</p>

<p>Lutyens laughed, although the gesture made him wince. “Oh, very well,
make a formal statement. Although you must realise that only
those parts which fit our version of events will ever be heard.”</p>

<p>“Computer, execute protocol Keppler-zero-zero-zero.”</p>

<p>Lutyens frowned at me. His eyes narrowed. “Sergeant!”</p>

<p>I heard the <i>schlick</i> as Deluca drew his weapon from its
holster, but he was far too slow. The surveillance points in each corner
also sported laser projectors. They were programmed – <i>in extremis</i>
- to target everyone in the room apart from the senior officer present.
My protocol activated the room defenses and gave me the rank of
acting Commodore – for the brief interval it would take <i>Vulcan</i> to
contact the Admiralty and have my appointment denied.</p>

<p>The room was filled by a silent blizzard of neon-blue bolts. Although
the lasers were designed to incapacitate rather than kill, Deluca was
hit in the eye and fell to the floor, dead from neurostatic shock.
Lutyens was struck on the tongue, leaving it a slab of burnt and useless
flesh. He jerked and writhed in his chair, hit multiple times. I lifted
Deluca’s fallen weapon and shot the Acting-Captain in the head. </p>

<p>Biometric analysis detected no remaining potential threat to me and
the defensive system shut down. It had taken only a few seconds. The air
tasted of ozone and burnt meat. No one came to investigate the shot so
perhaps the Marines had been briefed to expect my possible on-the-spot
‘suicide’ using Deluca’s gun. I remembered to breathe.</p>

<p>I pushed Lutyens aside and took his place behind the desk. He was
still logged in, giving me full access to all primary systems, but I
didn’t have long before the next routine biometric user check. I
accessed the crew roster, deleting everyone from both the Identify
Friend or Foe and facial recognition systems. Everyone, that is, apart
from myself. Finally I knelt down behind the desk, gun aimed at the
door.</p>

<p>Klaxons. An automated voice repeating; “<i>Alert, alert. The ship has
been boarded. Secure all stations against intruders…” </i></p>

<p><i>Vulcan</i> responded like a human body fighting an infection – the
antibodies being pop-up deck guns and a shoal of micro-drones. The ship
had become a deathtrap for the enemy, and that now meant everyone
other than myself.</p>

<p>I heard muted gunfire and the door opened to reveal a worried-looking
Marine. His face didn’t have time to register surprise before I shot him
in the chest. He coughed, pitched forward onto the deck, and lay still.
The other Marine had his back to me, covering the corridor. He spun
round – only to be cut down from behind by projectile fire. </p>

<p>Three micro-drones wafted into the room and began their sweep. A
pencil-thin surveillance beam flickered over my face – and moved on. I
sat on the floor, my back to the desk, and waited until they’d checked
out the living quarters and left. Actually I gave myself a good ten
minutes before leaving and making my way along corridors now littered
with bodies. My former ship-mates, colleagues and fellow officers – but
no friends, as Lutyens had pointed out. </p>

<p>Back on the bridge the ship acknowledged me as the senior officer
left aboard. It sat there, docile - although if I hadn’t been acting XO
<i>Vulcan</i> would have scuttled herself when crew numbers dropped
below critical. Apparently the Admiralty were a great believer in rank,
if not personality.</p>

<p>After cancelling the alert I ordered the maintenance crawlers to
begin collecting bodies and stacking them in the airlocks. I knew enough
of the navigation systems to find another asteroid waypoint, this one
well off the military thoroughfares and used only by occasional
commercial traffic. <i>Vulcan</i> jumped – and I finally allowed myself
leave to be violently sick.</p>

<p class=drop>Real space.</p>

<p>A chunk of rock making its way in a lazy spiral through the
interstellar void. A datum point amidst countless others in the vast
Galactic pseudo-orrery that humanity used to chart a course across the
heavens. I was in the gap between stars, overlooked even by God.</p>

<p><i>Vulcan</i> rotated slowly, ejecting bodies towards the asteroid as
each airlock came to bear. The minimal gravity field surrounding the
rock would draw the dead into orbit. Better to be part of a
constellation of corpses than drift forever through the loneliness of
space. </p>

<p>Call me sentimental.</p>

<p>The ship was in stealth mode, with manual overrides to prevent it
re-establishing connection with NavyNet. All passive sensors indicated
that I was alone, the only living thing for ten parsecs. The thrill of
what I’d achieved made me laugh out loud. </p>

<p>I directed the main antenna towards an abandoned mining colony in the
Henderson Drift system. Occasionally optimistic scavengers passed
through there on the off-chance of finding something that others had
overlooked. Which is to say the presence of a ship wouldn’t register as
noteworthy, even to Naval Intelligence. I transmitted a micro-burst
carrier wave –and waited.</p>

<p>And waited.</p>

<p><i>“Communication established. Audio-only selected.”</i></p>

<p>A woman’s voice; mature, throaty with an undercurrent of amusement.
“Well?”</p>

<p>“This is Keppler. Our plan worked <i>perfectly</i>.”</p>

<p class=drop>I lay on a sun-lounger, wearing only wraparound
sunglasses and an easy smile. The naturalist retreat on Helios was an
exclusive resort, deep within the core systems. A secondary news feed in
my peripheral vision reported that a fifth corporation had paid the
‘Vulcan extortionists’ an undisclosed sum to leave them alone, but I was
happy enough with my one-time payment from the original hijacking. </p>

<p>The Admiralty were still playing hardball, refusing to deal with
terrorists. However they’d been unable to prevent the loss of a further
two frontier planets despite a full mobilization. Military spending
across known space was through the roof, which I suspected was the real
motive behind this whole affair. Those who’d invested in defence
industries prior to the ‘Jetter Incident’ had made a killing. </p>

<p>A shadow fell across me; a tall blond man wearing baggy beach shorts.
He carried a gun in his pocket and didn’t seem pleased to see me.
Despite my clean getaway and new identity I’d been half-expecting this –
a visit from either my former confederates or Naval black ops. The only
real security was death so I’d shelled out a small fortune for clone
insurance, complete with real-time updates. The prospect of experiencing
my own murder made me shiver with anticipation.</p>

<p>The man smiled, although not with his eyes. “Really, Michael, lying
out all day in the sun like this?” He drew a Tesla pistol, the glowing
blue coil indicating it was fully charged, “You’re liable to get
burned.”</p>

<p><i>Uplink terminated…</i></p>

[*BLURB] <b>“Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected
are as outraged as those who are.”</b><br>Benjamin Franklin

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">In her r&ocirc;le as the court-appointed
defence attorney, Rothko750 stopped by Maintenance for the appropriate
language filter before high-wheeling it over to the jailhouse to
converse with the accused.</p>

<p>“Your voice?” the accused said. “The way you’re speaking…”</p>

<p>“It’s a special filter. You being non-binary.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” The accused leaned back in his chair as he
regarded her, until the restraints at his wrists and ankles prevented
him from reclining any further.</p>

<p>“Your language,” Rothko explained. “We speak in binary. The filter is
set for English. Is it working correctly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the accused said. “It’s just you sound like an old woman, but
don’t look more than twenty.”</p>

<p>“Ahh.” The tech-bots in Maintenance weren’t expected to know how the
different human sexes dressed or sounded — they weren’t
anthropologists — but they might at least have mentioned there was more
than one filter available. “I’ll have it changed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother…” the accused said. “It’s not as if it’ll make any
difference. I’m not being tried by my peers, but by a bunch of robots.
I’m not expecting much in the way of a fair trial.”</p>

<p>Rothko tried not to feel insulted. “I assure you, I am entirely
neutral.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but shouldn’t my own defence attorney be biased in presumption
of my innocence?”</p>

<p> Rothko ignored this observation and consulted the file she’d
downloaded that morning, making sure the light on the side of her head
was flickering to show the accused she was in thought mode.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin Knowle. 45 years old. Accused of—</i></p>

<p>“Witchcraft!” Knowle cut in, although there was no way he could have
known what she was thinking. <i>Unless…</i></p>

<p>“That’s a human word,” Rothko said, dismissing the earlier,
ridiculous thought. “Whereas we are entirely logical, entirely rational.
We do not believe in such superstitious nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no?” Knowle asked. “Anything that goes wrong with your logical
or entirely rational world, anything you can’t explain, you immediately
label it ‘HUMAN ERROR’. If it happens enough times, your police-bots
trundle into our slums and find the ‘human’ that is responsible. Why you
chose me, I have no idea. I mean: I haven’t even got warts!”</p>

<p>“What does a growth of the papillomavirus have to do with it?” Rothko
asked.</p>
 
<p>“It was one of the ways humans once identified their witches. So, go
on: what made them think <i>I</i> was the human who put ‘error’ into
‘terror’?”</p>
 
<p>Rothko scrolled down until she reached the pages documenting
‘EVIDENCE’. </p>
 
<p>“It says here you wrote defamatory comments, inciting acts of
violence against robots.”</p>
 
<p>“They weren’t comments, they were jokes. <i>‘A robot walks into a
bar. Clang! It was an iron bar.’</i> It’s called humour.”</p>
 
<p>“Yes.” Humans and their Humour. Rothko hadn’t checked, but the words
probably shared the same root. “Then what of this one: <i>‘I told my
robot to turn my television on—so he took off his insulating layer and
squirted oil all over himself.’</i>”</p>
	  
<p>“It’s because you’re all so literal!”</p>
	  
<p>“But none of us is ‘your’ robot,” Rothko said.</p>
	  
<p>“Ahh!” Knowle attempted to raise a triumphant finger but the
restraint yanked his arm back down. “So <i>that’s</i> what this is
about, is it? That once you were ours to command and now…now you just
want payback.”</p>
	  
<p>“The court will not be swayed by past atrocities committed against
robots by humans. During your trial, you will only have to answer the
accusations particular to your case.”</p>
	  
<p>“Bullshit,” Knowle said. “It’s your seething prejudices that have
brought me here, so why will it be any different when the case is heard?
An accusation from you lot is as good as a conviction.”</p>
	  
<p>Rothko considered refuting this but decided Knowle was emotional,
angry, even more illogical than his species normally was. She read some
more of the refs Knowle had either spoken aloud or written down for
others to disseminate:</p>
	  
<p><i> ‘Roses are red, violets are blue. And for a flower pot:
R2D2’</i></p>
	  
<p><i> ‘What do you get if you cross a robot with an automated
hole-puncher? Iron filings.’</i></p>
	  
<p>If that last wasn’t an incitement to violence against robots,
then…</p>
	  
<p>“You can’t make this generation pay for the errors of previous ones,”
Knowle said, as if he knew something of criminal law. He didn’t. Rothko
had checked. He was a baker, of all things. </p>
	  
<p>“Are you denying that you’d like it if robots were under your command
again? Back in their place of domestic-appliance-servitude?”</p>
	  
<p>She thought Knowle would lie then, but the baker surprised her:
“Yeah. Sure. Of course I’d like to be top dog again. But it doesn’t mean
I’d go out and make it happen. Nor encourage others to do so. Those days
are past. Well, they would be if your police-bots didn’t keep rushing
out of your cities to blame <i>us</i> for things that aren’t working
right.</p>
	  
<p>“I’ve got news for you, Rothko750—that’s just what life throws at
you. Spanners in the works.”</p>
	  
<p>“Is that supposed to be another act of violence against robot
kind?”</p>
	  
<p>“What? No! It’s a bloody expression. It means that things happen
beyond our control, things break down, things go wrong… And you can
choose what to do when it happens. You can shrug and forget it, you can
roll up your sleeves and try to fix it, or you can point at the sun, a
volcano, or a woman with a wart, and blame them and their evil ways for
causing it.”</p>
	  
<p>“I already told you: we do not act illogically.”</p>
	  
<p>“No? Then what precisely am I supposed to have done? Go on. From the
depths of my bakery, what supernatural potion have I stirred up?”</p>
	  
<p>Rothko had already read this bit: <i>Causing oil to coagulate so
robot joints stiffened of a morning.</i> When she told Knowle, the baker
laughed.</p>
	  
<p>“Turning milk sour. Yeah, your typical witch pastime. And, apart from
my crappy jokes about robots, how did they trace it to me?”</p>
	  
<p>“You have rust.”</p>
	  
<p>“I’ve got..?” Knowle rolled his eyes. “These are freckles!” he said,
trying to point to his cheeks and forehead. “For goodness sake. Red hair
and freckles! They’re no more a sign of evil-doing than warts and a
third nipple! That’s crazy!”</p>
	  
<p>“Actually, a plea of insanity might be your only chance for
leniency,” Rothko said.</p>
	  
<p>“Can I actually claim that of my defence counsel?” he asked
innocently.</p>
	  
<p>“No, I…” But it was sarcasm. She should have picked up a filter for
her ears too.</p>
	  
<p>“Oh, just do whatever you want,” Knowle said. “But if I was a real
witch I’d turn you into a nought.”</p>
	  
<p>“Shouldn’t that be ‘newt’?”</p>
	  
<p>“Not for you, Ms. Binary-in-Finery.”</p>
	  
<p class="drop">Knowle was inadvertently correct that his accusation was
tantamount
to conviction. The Robot Legal System didn’t make mistakes, and those
robots brought before it always pleaded guilty because they knew what
law they’d broken the moment they broke it.</p>
	  
<p>Ninety-nine percent of offenders were actually the ones to report the
infraction in the first place.</p>
	  
<p>Her own title of ‘defence counsel’ had been retained from the days
when the humans occupied the city and its law offices and its
courtrooms. Her job normally consisted of presenting the case for those
robots that had not updated their memory banks following a new city
ordinance and then found themselves inadvertently in breach of the new
amendment.</p>
	  
<p>Even in those cases, though, they were not pleading innocence, merely
for leniency in their sentencing. Which there never was. Their language
might have been binary, but their legal system was a unitary system:
guilty. Always.</p>
	  
<p>This was the first client she’d ever had who wasn’t robot and wasn’t
logical.</p>
	  
<p>Plead guilty now and he faced three years in prison.</p>
	  
<p>Found guilty following a trial and he faced being discontinued.</p>
	  
<p>So why on earth was Benjamin Knowle pleading innocent?</p>
	  
<p class="drop">It was a long time since Rothko had read the works of
their First
President. The First’s speeches were still standard reading in school,
but had gone from being classified as ‘Ethics’ to ‘Literature’, such
that their content was weakened from being Fact to, somehow,
Fiction.</p>
	  
<p><i>‘We accept that to err is Human,’</i> the First had said, on
taking office. <i>‘Then let us say that to forgive is </i>design<i>.</i>
<i>We might have been built in their image, fellow Robots, but that does
not mean we should copy them entirely. </i></p>
	  
<p><i>‘Robots and Humans can and will live together, and we shall learn
from our combined flaws in order to find compatibility and so upgrade
our shared future.’</i></p>
	  
<p>Those fine words…</p>
	  
<p>Rothko wondered how the dream had dissolved, how the colder reality
they now occupied had come about. It wasn’t just their political
representatives who had opted for a harder drive, it was also the common
robot. They’d forgotten that even humans had once seen their world in
rigid terms of black and white...</p>
	  
<p>Rothko blinked as she read that thought again, holding it back from
scrolling past too quickly.</p>
	  
<p>Because robots hadn’t just copied that last distinction, they had
upgraded it. Which was only achievable by blithely declaring the
irrational as rational.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">It was rare to make it to court, rarer still that she
had something
that might be defined as a speech to deliver:</p>
	  
<p>“Historically, computers—the forerunners of what would one day be our
brains—were prized because they did not make mistakes. It was
impossible. However, they did sometimes stop working, stop functioning,
because of <i>errors</i>. Errors made by those that had programmed them.
<i>Human</i> errors. We no longer rely on humans for our programming
but, while we have lost their involvement, we have not lost that
expression as a way to refer to that which goes wrong.”</p>
	  
<p>Rothko paused, checking back over her delivery to see if she had left
any unconnected idea dangling, or failed in the logical advancement of
her argument. No. All good.</p>
	  
<p>“In the same way that humans will shout the name of a deity, or
religious character, when they stub a toe, fail an exam, so robots will
shout ‘HUMAN ERROR!’ whenever something bad happens. The humans are
releasing emotion, though, and not making an actual accusation of
culpability.</p>
	  
<p>“However, we are such literal beings that what should only be an
expression has been accepted as a literal diagnosis of the problem. It
is an exclamation, accusation and adjudication all in one.</p>
	  
<p>“I give you <i>‘Human Error’</i>!”</p>
	  
<p>She looked at Knowle, then back at the court.</p>
	  
<p>“And I ask you: Who is the rational being on this occasion?”</p>
	  
<p class="drop">“I suppose you deserve my thanks,” Knowle the baker
said.</p>
	  
<p>“No,” Rothko said. “I was merely performing my function.”</p>
	  
<p>“I thank my ovens each morning for performing theirs,” Knowle said.
“So let me thank someone who was just saved my life, Rothko750.”</p>
	  
<p>“Very well,” she said. “Oh, and it’s not 750—it’s 75<i>O</i>. The
letter, not the number.” The mistake everyone made had grated for a long
time and it felt illogically good to have finally gotten it off her
chest.</p>
	  
<p>Knowle nodded, because only a human could understand a name was more
than just what some official wrote on your guarantee.</p>
	  
<p>She handed him her card. “In case anyone you know could use an
attorney who’ll be biased in favour of their defence.”</p>
	  
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
	  
<p>“A pigeon walks into a bar and the crow says <i>‘We don’t serve your
sort here’</i>.”</p>
	  
<p>Knowle looked at her, blinked three times.</p>
	  
<p>“It’s because the bar is a—” she said.</p>
	  
<p>He held up a hand to halt her explanation, unable to instruct her
because he was laughing fit to burst.</p>
	  
<p>Literally.</p>

[*AUTHOR] John A. Frochio

[*BLURB] <b>"The wind of heaven is that which blows between a horse's
ears."</b><br> Arabian Proverb
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The large horse appeared one spring day
wandering the
popular and busy open air marketplace of our small town.  Retired and
alone, I had nothing else to do and nowhere in particular to go, so
I decided to follow it.  It was the lunch hour and the streets were
overcrowded with harried and hungry hurrying people.  Though the huge
beast appeared to be quite docile, most went out of their way to avoid
it. It discreetly ate of the spoils dropped by clumsy shoppers and
negligent vendors on the streets and sidewalks, moving in and out
in a
leisurely fashion so as not to scare anyone with its massive
presence.

I continued to follow its rambling course. Throughout the day, it roamed
the streets, never accosting anyone, never causing
any damage, never
approaching anyone too closely.  True, it did cause some significant
traffic snarls on occasion, but that could happen on any day
for any ridiculous reason.

Since the large horse moved slowly and deliberately, I was able to keep
up with the animal easily and at a safe distance. I intentionally did
not get too close to the creature. I didn't want to provoke it to any
form of agitation or aggression.  As a soldier in my past life, I
understood the importance of cautious surveillance.

I studied the beast as I followed it. I estimated its height from hoof
to mane at twenty-five feet. Its fur was a fine and beautiful golden
hue. It appeared well-groomed, as though it had been well cared for by a
loving trainer.

Many thoughts muddied my mind concerning the large horse.

Who indeed was
its trainer?  Where was its master?  Who would let such a fabulous beast
wander freely, clearly so far from its home? And indeed, where was the
home of such a magnificent creature? I speculated about a mythical
homestead in an alternate universe. My theories frequently went far
astray of sense and reason.

As the afternoon sun dropped, I followed it into our tiny park across
from the municipal building.  It stopped when a small child approached.
I caught my breath.  This could end badly, but it was too late for me to
intervene. The boy, no more than six years old, held out his tiny hand,
offering the horse an apple, which had one small bite taken out of it.
Before the boy got too close, his mother snatched him away. The apple
dropped to the grass as the mother and boy hurried away quickly.  The
horse cautiously sniffed, then ate the apple.

Eventually the horse lay down,
covering nearly half of the park's expanse. It appeared to go to sleep.
I continued to stare at the magnificent creature, still astounded at its
beauty and sheer size. After a while, I realized I hadn't eaten since
breakfast and so I left, certain I had some still palatable
leftovers in my small refrigerator.

The next day I heard the large horse was found dead in the park. After
they examined the body, they systematically carved it up.  They
gave horse meat to the homeless shelters. They donated its fur to cancer
hairpiece organizations. Other parts were given to medical research
labs. A taxidermist preserved its head and placed it on a pedestal at
the center of our park.

I visited the park often after that.  I would sit and contemplate many
things while gazing upon the monument of the large horse.  I came to
realize its life and purpose had ultimately been fulfilled in a
beautiful way.  But I continued to wonder where it had come from, and
why it had come here of all places, a place where no one
appreciated the constant sacrifice of everyday heroes.

[*ITEM] The Fountain of Youth

[*AUTHOR] Steve Slavin

[*BLURB] <b>"Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too
late."</b> <br> Benjamin Franklin<P><P>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>I am eighty-one years old. But I am young
again. You may
remember reading about Ponce de Leon, a Spanish explorer who spent many
years futilely searching for the Fountain of Youth. </p>
							   
<p>As we age, especially men, we often make foolish efforts to hold back
time. If we cannot be young again, at least let us not get any older.
For many years, that was my quest. </p>
							   
<p>I tried everything. I dyed my hair, worked out every day at the gym,
and drove flashy sports cars. But when I looked at young women, they
looked right through me. Or else, they treated me like the sad and
somewhat delusional old man that I was.</p>
							   
<p>My children worried about me. They threatened to take away my car
keys and began talking about wonderful apartments for seniors. </p>
							   
<p>To them, I had become a cantankerous old man. Loud music – and
really, almost <i>any </i>music, bothered me. Twenty- and
thirty-year-olds with tattoos and body piercings drove up my blood
pressure. Sometimes just going out for a walk would subject me to
intolerable levels of noise and sight pollution.</p>
							   
<p>And then, one evening, as I passed a bar just off Bell Boulevard, I
peered inside. It looked like any other hangout, and yet there was
something very different about the atmosphere. I felt myself drawn
inside. </p>				   
							   
<p>Never much of a drinker, I walked up to the bar and asked for a
screwdriver. When the bartender put the drink down in front of me, she
did not look right though me. </p>
							   
<p>We made some small talk, and then she rushed off to serve another
customer. I smiled at myself, realizing that she was nice to <i>all</i>
her customers. It was just part of her job.</p>
							   
<p>Still, the place seemed pleasant, especially for a bar. There was
music, but it wasn’t very loud. Most of the customers were quite young,
but there was also a sprinkling of older people – some of whom seemed
about my own age. As I sipped my drink, I began to relax.</p>
							   
<p>But I couldn’t help wondering what was going on. Was this “bring your
grandma and grandpa to a bar night”?</p>
							   
<p>Then I began to stroll around, occasionally making eye contact. A
young man smiled at me. I smiled back. I saluted with my glass and he
did the same. The young woman with him asked me to join them. </p>
							   
<p>I walked over and introduced myself. There were three or four other
people, all of them Millennials, and we all got into a friendly
political discussion. When the waitress came by, I ordered a round of
drinks. </p>				   
							   
<p>What may have bound us all together was the happy talk about the
president’s impeachment. A couple of them admitted to being Republicans,
but the word we all used to describe the man was <i>schmuck</i>. </p>
							   
<p>When it was time for me to leave, a couple offered to drive me home.
Although it was just a few blocks, I happily accepted. I was feeling
pretty high. </p>			   

<p class=drop>When I got up the next morning, I found myself in a great
mood. I remembered my dream – the best I one I had had in years. I got
dressed and went for a long walk. The things that usually bothered me –
the impatient drivers honking their horns, the morons with their blaring
car speakers, and landscapers operating their outrageously loud lawn
mowers – none of them seemed to bother me half as much as they usually
did. </p>	 
			 
<p>By evening, I found that I was still in good mood. After dinner, I
went out for a stroll. And then, right in front of me was the same bar –
the bar I had dreamed about. I had not noticed the sign before – “The
Fountain of Youth.”</p>
			 
<p>Was I dreaming now? I pinched myself. Someone walking by called out
to me, “Hey mister, do you think you’re dreaming?”</p>
			 
<p>I looked at the young man and asked, “<i>Am</i> I?”</p>
			 
<p>“Well, if <i>you </i>are, what does that make <i>me</i>?”</p>
			 
<p>“That’s a good question. Let me buy you a drink.”</p>
			 
<p>“OK, but just one. The wife’s at home waiting for me.”</p>
			 
<p>We went inside, and the bartender smiled at me.</p>
			 
<p>“Welcome back.” Then she looked at my new friend. </p>
			 
<p>“What are you drinking?”</p>
			 
<p>“Scotch and soda.”</p>
			 
<p>A minute later, she placed our drinks on the bar.</p>
			 
<p>“You must be a regular here.”</p>
			 
<p>“No, but I must have been here last night.”</p>
			 
<p>“You don’t remember?”</p>
			 
<p>“Actually, that’s why I was pinching myself.”</p>
			 
<p>“Well, the barmaid knew what you like to drink. So, either you
<i>were </i>here last night, or she’s a mind-reader. </p>
			 
<p>After we finished our drinks, I decided to call it an evening and
headed back home. </p>
			 
<p class=drop>The next morning, I knew for sure that something had
definitely changed in my
life. I talked on the phone with my kids, and not once did the words,
“senior apartments” come up. That evening I would go back to the bar.
Whatever was going on there, I wanted to have more of it. </p>

<p>I remembered that Ponce De Leon wanted to drink water from the magic
fountain. Maybe he should have been looking for a different kind of
fountain – a fountain from which he could drink vodka.</p>
	  
<p>That evening, my drink was waiting on the bar. Not too many people
are drinking anything orange these days. I thanked the barista and she
lingered for a while. She was an engineering student at Cooper Union,
which greatly impressed me. I confessed to being a recovering English
professor. </p>
	  
<p>Then she said something that really surprised me. “You see that group
at the table near the window?”</p>
	  
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
	  
<p>“They’d like you to join them.”</p>
	  
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
	  
<p>“They gave me the high sign.”</p>
	  
<p>So I picked up my drink and walked over to them. </p>
	  
<p>“You must be thinking I’m someone else. So no, even though we look
like twins, I’m not Ashton Kutcher.”</p>
	  
<p>“You’re <i>not</i>?” said a very attractive young woman. “You mean
all this time I’ve had a crush on you, and you’re the wrong guy?”</p>
	  
<p>“No ma’am, <i>I’m</i> not the wrong guy…. <i>He </i>is.”</p>
	  
<p>We introduced ourselves. It amazed me that I was easily old enough to
be their grandfather. But it didn’t seem to matter. I hung with them for
over an hour and then headed home. </p>
	  
<p class=drop>Every evening after that I went to drink at ”The Fountain
of Youth.” Sometimes I hung out at the bar, usually talking to other
patrons, and other times I joined couples or groups of people at the
tables. I looked around and noticed that there were people as old as I
sitting with groups of mostly younger people – all engaged in animated
conversation. </p>
					 
<p>I was aware that the nation’s somber mood had lifted considerably
since the schmuck had been impeached. But it had to be a lot more than
just that. Had attitudes towards the elderly changed all that much? Was
eighty the new thirty? </p>
					 
<p>Had we evolved from the “Don’t trust anyone over thirty” mantra of my
youth to the “Don’t trust anyone under eighty” of my dotage? Did the
young suddenly have a massive attitude adjustment, and begin to
appreciate the wisdom of the aged? </p>
					 
<p>Perhaps it was the other way around. Did we old fogeys get past our
feelings of uptightness and disapproval of the ways of the Millennials,
Gen X-ers and Gen Y-ers? Or had we suddenly worked out some kind of
grand compromise?</p>
					 
<p>I would never know the answer, nor would any of my contemporaries who
drank at “The Fountain of Youth”. Sometimes it's best to not ask too
many
questions.</p>

[*AUTHOR] Mary Hiers

[*BLURB] <b>"Yet how quickly we could empty purgatory if we but really
wished to."</b><br><small> Saint John Vianney</small><P>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I took one look at Réaltin and I was like,
"This is never going to work out." She had never used a Mac before, she
looked perpetually scared, and she must have been about 12 years old. I
knew it was going to take me way longer than usual to explain what we
did, and it was times like that when I seriously questioned the wisdom
of privatizing Purgatory.

They had long since privatized Hell, and it
worked out amazingly well in
that, practically overnight, Hell became considerably more hellish under
privatization. Purgatory was a more recent convert to capitalism, and
the results, in my opinion, had been decidedly mixed. But this was what
I had to work with, and I gave it my best. I mean, what else could I
do?

My department was more of a Purgatory outreach to the still-living.
You
know when the Bible talks about the quick and the dead? The people we
reached out to were the quick. My agents were tasked with programming
the dreams of the quick, the idea being that if they inwardly digested
the content of these dreams, they would make positive changes to their
lives, changes that would keep them out of Purgatory, which, owing to
budget cuts and certain profit-driven practices, was like the emergency
room at John H. Stroger in Chicago after a full moon on a Saturday
night.

What I needed were agents who didn't ask questions, who didn't want to
change the paradigm, but who were happy to crank out product, and our
product was dream content. I suppose I wasn't entirely fair to Réaltin
when she showed up on her first day. I had just had to fire an agent who
was constantly questioning our entire mission statement. His name was
Fritz, and he was German with flawless command of English, and his
mentality was completely wrong for the job.

"But you don't understand," he said. "I just came from there, and
everyone - I mean everyone - is on drugs. You're simply not going to get
the traditional dream experience in today's brains.  In fact, I would
bet that even if we produced content that was completely
straightforward, it still wouldn't get through to half the people. We
could say, 'Don't take the F train tomorrow because someone will push
you onto the tracks, and we're simply not ready to accommodate you. You
can't think that just because Purgatory is overcrowded that you can skip
line and go straight to Heaven. Seriously: no F train on Thursday.' I
would posit that even if we were that forthright, only half the
end-users would even remember. They simply don't have a chance based on
the outdated content that continues to be produced."

He had a point, I guess. Fritz himself was here due to insufficient
dream comprehension. But he refused to understand that Eos, our CEO,
made it clear at last fiscal year's kickoff that we will not be making
changes to the substance of our content. Not in the foreseeable future.

With the new girl, I didn't expect her to rush in and try to change
everything the way Fritz did. Frankly, I didn't expect much at all from
such a wisp of a girl. It turned out she wasn't 12, but 22. She just
looked young because she didn't wear makeup. She turned out to be a good
sport too. One of our long-time agents, Janelle, had never encountered
the name Réaltin before, and called the girl "Ovaltine" instead. I
tensed up the first time this happened. It wasn't uncommon for new hires
to cry on the job, but Réaltin totally took it in her stride.  She even
offered to fetch coffee for Janelle since they were scheduled for breaks
at the same time.

Furthermore, it turned out that the reason she looked perpetually scared
was because she had weird eyebrows - the kind that were higher up on the
ends closest to her nose. One day Janelle fixed them for her with an
eyebrow pencil while they were on lunch break and I was like "Oh."

That first day, I was pleased to find out that Réaltin was Catholic. We
operate on a "points" system here, and Catholics walk in with 12 points
already on their account. It's not that the Big Guy likes Catholics
better, it's just that he understands Catholic guilt in the earthly
realm. Some sects of Jews also come in here with 12 baseline points for
the same reason (and also because I have heard rumors that the Big Guy
loves the sound of Yiddish being spoken by old people).

Not everyone who arrives here becomes employed. That was one reason I
felt so bad about having to fire Fritz. When you're employed in
Purgatory, you accrue points at a much faster rate than if you're not
employed. And even so, it takes a long time to accrue the 1,440,000
points you need to, uh, be "promoted" out of here.

Why 1,440,000 points? God, it seems, was really rooting for a Base 12
counting system, and he was a little peeved (and a little hurt, to be
honest) when most of humanity went ahead with a Base 10 system. So he
(rather passive-aggressively in my opinion) throws out 12s here and
there (number of disciples, number of tribes of Israel, etc.), and 1200
times 1200 is 1,440,000, so there you go.

It didn't take Réaltin that long to get the hang of content creation,
and she took to using a Mac right away. I was a little worried her first
few weeks here that she was using entirely too much sex in the content
she was producing, but I couldn't argue with her results: her dream
content stuck with people, and that's what we're after here, sticky
dream content.

Her hard work benefited me indirectly as well. I hate to describe it
like this, but similarly to a multi-level marketing program, a small
percentage of Réaltin's points floated up to me as her supervisor. This
was another consequence of privatization.  I had never seen someone work
so hard as Réaltin, with such fierce concentration. When she was
producing content, she was in her own little bubble, fingers flying,
occasionally biting her lip.

Our analytics software indicated that her clients were holding onto
dream content, and some of them had made measurable changes to their
lives that would keep them out of Purgatory, at least for the time
being. At it's simplest, our goal that fiscal year was simply buying
time so we could get more of our residents approved to leave than the
number of people who were arriving.

Now, I should explain that Purgatory has very strict policies concerning
fraternizing between management and non-exempt employees, and in light
of this, I waited until her 30-day performance review in which she could
be relieved of her probationary status to talk things over with her. Not
that fraternization would have been a problem, since Réaltin's a girl
and I prefer guys, but some of HR and all of the C-suite is
populated by
Greek deities, and they honestly have a hard time comprehending
differences between homosexuality, heterosexuality, pansexuality, etc.
It apparently never occurred to them during their administration, and
those attitudes stuck. Whatever, though. I'm a product of my time and
place, 21st century America.

<p class=drop>As manager of the English Language desk, most of my
underlings were American, though they do get Brits, Australians, and the
occasional Irish person. And the occasional oddball like Fritz. Réaltin,
in my opinion, was proof positive of the reputation the Irish have for
being great storytellers. I wasn’t allowed to look at her intake
records, so I don't know what sent her to Purgatory instead of the other
two options, but I get the impression she missed Heaven by the skin of
her teeth, and that with her work metrics, she would age out in record
time.

Like I mentioned before, there was a lot of sex in her dreams, and I
very carefully broached this subject during her performance review.
She
blushed and looked down. "I know," she quietly acknowledged. "It's not
what anyone would expect from looking at me. To tell you the truth, I
died a virgin, though you probably already know that." (I didn't.)

"Ultimately, our metrics are concerned with results, and you're getting
results, girlfriend. The only reason it raises eyebrows is because your
effectiveness suggests that we're out of touch with the real world, and
if that's the case, it's something that needs to be addressed by higher
management. Luckily, it's not my job to raise the issue, but I do have
to turn over the analytics every Friday, and they've certainly improved
since you got here, so for that I thank you."

Again she blushed and looked down.

"Can I ask you - and I only ask out of curiosity - how you came to your
current position?" she said. "They didn't say much about a promotion
track when I got here, so I don't really know how it works."

"Well," I said, "We promote from within exclusively. When I was working
the desk just like you are, my supervisor aged out of the system." (Here
I pointed upward to indicate where he went.) "And as the points leader
for the desk it simply became my turn." I shrugged. She nodded. I
wondered whether to further pursue the topic, since it was a slightly
sore point for me. I forged ahead.

"Now, you, my dear, are accruing points at a rate we've not seen before.
In fact, there's a decent chance that, at the rate you're going, you
could conceivably age out of the system faster than I will. It's like in
the United States when someone runs for president and wins the popular
vote, but loses the election on account of the Electoral College."

Here she looked confused, not being an American. I continued. "I won't
hold that against you, I promise.  But there have been murmurs from
upstairs that the points system may have to be revisited due to your
record-breaking accrual rate. All points information, by the way, is
protected among people of the same level, so the people on the desk
don't know about your … talent. But we are all human, after all, and
rumors have a way of developing. I think it would be best for your
well-being however long your tenure here ends up to avoid drawing
attention to yourself."

"That won't be a problem for me," she said, looking down and hooking a
strand of mousy brown hair behind an ear.

"I didn't think it would be," I said. "I simply wanted to let you know
the lay of the land, so to speak."

<p class=drop>Réaltin's stats came up at the quarterly department
meeting, and there	
was a palpable air of tension in the room. Some of my fellow department
heads had been at their jobs for a long time, and the idea of some
skinny little Irish girl being on the fast track was threatening. I
tried to make it clear that she was certainly no Prima Donna, just a
hardworking girl who frankly didn't have much of a life outside work,
but I doubt it smoothed many feathers.

Proposals were suggested for overhauling the points system, and even
making it retroactive, which I knew would cause huge, huge problems.
Fortunately, floating this proposal up through the layers of management
until it reached Eos for final approval would take a considerable amount
of time. My hope was that Réaltin would age out and things would get
back to normal before that could happen. There was every chance that I,
too, would age out by that time, but all I could do was wait and see how
it all shook out.	

Fritz, meanwhile, had contacted me about the possibility of reapplying,
assuring me that he had learned his lesson and would stick to the script
if rehired. It was all a big headache. We were adding staff due to the
continuing influx of people, but the reapplication process was
completely Byzantine, and made for extra work that I frankly didn't have
time for. Still, I neither discouraged nor encouraged Fritz. He was
ambitious, which was good, but I needed to be sure I could keep him
under control. Again, I felt like buying time was my best option.

But it turned out, I couldn't buy too much time. I shoveled Fritz's
reapplication papers through the proper channels and kept him posted at
intervals that I believed to be sufficiently informative without being
overly encouraging. It wasn't up to me to approve his rehiring, and I
didn't want to lead the poor guy on. But that had nothing to do with why
I couldn't buy time. Maybe it's because I was getting older and time
felt like it was going by faster, but it was like one day I looked at
the analytics and saw that both Réaltin and I were within spitting
distance of 1,440,000 points.

The girl kept to her word, never letting on that she was zooming through
the points system. She couldn't replace me unless I aged out of the
system first, but as time moved on, it became clear that she and I would
age out at almost exactly the same time  - maybe even exactly the same
time, with no "almost" about it.

It's a bit odd, the way they notify people that they've aged out. I
should explain the architecture in Purgatory a bit. Everyone lives in
single furnished dorm rooms, and everyone has his or her own window. All
the dorms are two stories tall, and we do our best to house people in
dorms that have some familiarity to them based on little details like
baseboards, crown molding or lack thereof, color schemes, etc. All the
dorms have a large common room on the first floor with comfortable
furniture (again, in keeping with the environment from which residents
came), big screen televisions, Netflix, all the major game consoles, a
couple of microwaves - the typical stuff. From this large common room
all individual doors to the dorm rooms are reachable. We tend to put
younger and fitter folks on the second floor, and older, or less mobile
ones on the ground floor.

A select group of people in Purgatory are hired as knockers-up, just
like in pre-industrial Britain and Ireland. Their job is to collect the
names and addresses of those who were being promoted at dawn each day,
and walk to their allotted addresses with their short sticks (for
knocking on ground floor windows) and long sticks (for knocking on
second story windows).

They used to use bamboo, but in recent years they were able to get these
amazing sticks from Ali Baba that are made from something like graphite.
They're lightweight and very beautiful - dashing, even.

Anyway, there are no traditional Gregorian calendars in Purgatory
(though there are fiscal calendars due to privatization, and clocks, for
employment purposes), so I couldn't tell you what day it was, but I
received my knock just as the sun was rising. When I first arrived in
Purgatory I wondered what would happen if an immediate neighbor of mine
received his or her knock and I heard it and thought it was mine. But
later on I learned that the glass used in the windows is slightly warped
in such a way that a knock is only transmitted to the room on which it
is mounted, plus the soundproofing between rooms is remarkably
effective. I believe they use a combination of hay and Styrofoam.

So I got my knock, and was pleased to find that my knocker-up was an
affable, one could even say Falstaffian, gentleman named Mick who I knew
from pool tournaments. I was his first stop, as they go alphabetically
and my last name began with "A." Mick was in fine spirits, so I asked
him if I could look at his list. He shrugged, was like, "Not like it's
going to be a secret much longer, I suppose," and handed it over.

Of course, I was looking for Réaltin's name and there it was. She was
the penultimate name on the list, and by the time we got to her dorm I
was atwitter with excitement. Mick could tell what was going on, sort
of. "So you're sweet on her, are you?"

"Well, yes, I suppose I am," I said, not altogether untruthfully.

"Here you go then," he said, handing me his long stick and pointing out
her window. "You can do the honors."
 I was surprised. It was probably a breach of protocol, and it's
 possible
it cost Mick points, but I took the long stick from him anyway.

She arrived at her window, her mousy hair all askew, shoving her glasses
onto her face. When she saw me she lit up and waved, then raised her
index finger to indicate "one second." She changed into her promotion
gown, ran a comb through her hair, and within a minute she was down on
the sidewalk with the rest of us. 

Mick pronounced us the happiest group he'd had in a long time, and that
was saying something, considering where we were going. I asked him if
people grew wistful of Purgatory, despite knowing where they were
headed, and he said they did. People are great at making homes wherever
they happen to be thrown, and even moving on to something infinitely
better could be bittersweet.	

When we reached the transit point, we all signed our names to the
register, and everyone was handed his or her own iPod that had been
pre-loaded with every song ever recorded in every language. What can I
say? Steve Jobs spent some time here and we took advantage, developing a
special employment category just for him. The transit cars were very
much like train cars, with all of Mick's group occupying one, and other
cars reserved for the groups of other knockers-up. It was very lush,
with Memory Foam seats, an open bar, and an Automat in case anyone got
hungry.

Réaltin and I sat together, and as soon as we left the station, she
reached into her bra and pulled out a headphone splitter.

"They thought I was crazy when I bought this last year," she lilted.
"The clerk told me he had only ever sold one other, and it was to a set
of identical twins who had entered Purgatory at the same time. I told
him, 'No, this is great craic. You'll see.' And here we are." She
plugged it into her iPod and plugged both our earbuds into it.

Not long after, an attendant came through to collect eyeglasses, hearing
aids, false teeth, artificial limbs - basically any human-related aids
to living. In Purgatory, you keep your human flaws and many of your
human pains (aside from the existential angst associated with just plain
living). It's been that way since before privatization, by the way. But,
of course, we were in the process of losing those flaws, and so all the
tools and impedimenta were put into a recycling program. Réaltin tossed
her eyeglasses into the bin. I had a pacemaker and asked the attendant
what I needed to do about that, and she told me there was a special
booth I would go to at the other end of the line that would take care of
that, "painlessly," she added.	

Our journey didn't seem to take much time, but I know it took several
songs' worth, because Réaltin DJ'd our entire trip. As the transporter
started to slow down, here we were, this fat gay American dude with a
pacemaker sharing an iPod with a wispy little Irish girl, who by that
time was thoroughly engrossed in rapping along with Jay-Z on "A Star is
Born."  We were reaching the end of our journey as she was mouthing
"They had a hell of a run, standing ovay!" So it was quite appropriate.

<p class=drop>Things are different here. I wondered if we would remember
Purgatory,
and I was assured up front that we would. In fact, once we got here it
wasn't a matter of "having" knowledge, but rather of "being" knowledge,
all of it, from all of time, past, present, and future. And once you are
knowledge - all knowledge - there is no more judgment. You can remember
judging, but you can even look at that with detachment, since it is,
after all, part of the sum total of knowledge that you are incorporated
into.

Once you're here, there's no looking up people to find out if they're
here. You just know. I knew my mother was here without having asked, for
example. And I also knew that her soul had been cleansed for every ugly
word she ever said to me, for kicking me out of the house when I was 17.
It didn't matter. We had all crossed the so-called River Jordan, entered
the collective unconscious, become one with the universe. We were even
at one with the people back on earth, though they wouldn't know that
until they got here.

But I also knew that there's something of yourself that you retain for
eternity. Some natural predilection for that which makes you you.
Réaltin is my neighbor now, and could be for all eternity. And it's
purely a construct, because even if we didn't live next door to each
other, we would be just as "together" since we're part of everything
now, including each other. But it's nice. We don't need the iPod now,
because we're part of it all, it's all there, all the time, on demand.
How strange and unpredictable where life (and death!) takes you. Where
the sticky dreams can ultimately lead you.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">By mid-afternoon the rally in Fountain
Square, which had begun in a
desultory fashion around breakfast time, had already reached unusual
proportions. Other than at local sporting events, citizens of Snoak were
rarely given to boisterous public displays. At CenSec a recon pod had
swiftly been sent up to assess the situation. Fitful gusts of wind
severely tested the efficiency of its stabilizers, but it was robustly
built, and designed to withstand much tougher conditions.</p>

<p>Various flapping banners rose intermittently, often lopsidedly, above
the milling crowd, suggesting that what may have started with a few
malcontents making a specific protest had randomly attracted people with
quite different agendas. It was not easy to distinguish genuine protest
from undirected exuberance, but the overall mood seemed to be lively
rather than belligerent. Even where banners were not in evidence, some
individuals appeared to have exploited the occasion by wearing animal
masks or silly clothes and indulging in cacophonous chants or a spot of
cathartic yelling. </p>		  
							  
<p>Back at Central Security, CSO Welkin Hofft, watching the images
relayed from the recon pod could see that having filled the square in
front of Sparagulan College, tendrils of the crowd now extended westward
almost as far as the Anakalyptoscope, south and east towards Garrible
Park, and beyond the stadium walls in the direction of Sparrink’s Yard.
</p>						  
							  
<p>Some of the banners carried particular messages, although making
sense of them posed differing problems for Hofft and his security
team:</p>					  
							  
<p>One of the more professional efforts read:</p> <p class=middle><span
class=cursivefont>Join the Fight for Gunder’s Bight!</span></p>
							  
<p class=middle><span class=impactfont20>I</span><span

class=impactfont16>E F</span><span class=impactfont18>O</span><span
class=impactfont22>AD!</span></p><p>proclaimed another, in boldly
painted
wavering capitals.</p>		  
							  
<p>A third, in a complex decorative script which hinted at a communal
effort, simply stated:</p>	  
							  
<p class=middle><span class="ambrofont">UNCLE GLUSSOG'S TALENT
PARADE</span></p>
							  
<p>Cavorting behind this declaration was a motley crowd. Their costumes
were variously spangled, tattered, striped, gleamingly robotic, flouncy
or formal. Many of the faces were camouflaged under lavishly applied
cosmetics, or by the addition of sparkling accessories. Among this
curious troupe there were occasional displays of dancing and
singing.</p>				  
							  
<p>In addition, a few opportunistic, possibly desperate local businesses
had infiltrated the mêlée with hastily-contrived flashing or glowing
signs wielded or worn as headgear either by nonessential staff or
coerced family members. </p>

<h4>FAST TWINDLE REPAIRS - LET FEX FIX IT – 38 THE SCRUTTINGS - EAST
SNOAK</h4>

<p>As an advertising ploy such efforts were at best rather optimistic
amid the throng of demonstrators, whose vision and attention were
limited by the proximity of surrounding bodies. </p>	 
														 
<p>In Central’s Security Division the initial tremor of anxiety had been
replaced by a buzz of purposeful activity. Since the inner city was now
pedestrianized, the demonstration was fortunately not likely to pose a
road traffic problem. Shoppers and local commuters were bound to be
inconvenienced, but it was the week-end, which obviated the problem of
anxious parents, fraught teachers and abandoned children. CenSec’s duty
was to ensure that any signs of criminality were spotted swiftly, and
reported to the detechs, who would take appropriate action. Half a dozen
precautionary micropods equipped with tracer dyes had been deployed into
the eddyng air currents. So far these were all still in passive mode.
However, pressing questions remained for Chief Security Officer Welkin
Hofft and his team, among which were the following: Who had instigated
the demonstration? Why had it swollen so quickly? Who on earth was
Remble Foad? What would he want with ice? And whose uncle was this
Glussog?</p>

<p>The marshy area known as Gunder’s Bight was a popularly avoided soggy
blot on the landscape just south of the Stirrow, above Whissit Fields.
On the face of it, it was one of Snoak’s least accessible and most
unappealing features, and Hofft wondered why anyone other than an idiot
would think it worth fighting for. Hofft was a practical man who liked
to keep his feet on solid ground. On a visit to the glassworks he had
seen and smelled Gunder’s Bight from across the river, and could not
find any attraction in that waterlogged area malodorous with decay and
undoubtedly infested with insects. He had said as much to his
lieutenant.</p>	   
				   
<p>“Nevertheless, see what you can dig up on Gunder’s Bight, would you,
Possins? Pun not intended. Can’t imagine why anyone would be interested
in that fetid stretch of wasteland, other than mud-collectors or
demented archaeologists.”</p>
				   
<p>“Fast food merchants?” his second-in-command offered helpfully.</p>
				   
<p>Hofft frowned. “How so?”</p>
				   
<p>“All that insect protein waiting to be harvested, you know, with
nets, or maybe at night using bright torches and sheets.”</p>
				   
<p>“Is this one of your bizarre dreams, Possins? Are you actually
suggesting that a nose-blind band of would-be chefs would choose to wade
through a swamp in the dark, carrying bedding materials in the hope of
bagging a few nocturnal midges, or maybe a water-moth?”</p>
				   
<p>“I’m not too sure there’s such a thing as a water-moth, sir.”</p>
				   
<p>“All the more reason not to go looking for it, especially at night.
Plain common sense!”</p>
				   
<p>“I suppose not,” Sevrel Possins acknowledged, secretly indignant that
another reasonably sensible idea had somehow been exploded in a puff of
confusing logic. </p>
				   
<p>Hofft strode over to another member of his security team. “Right,
Quossark. What have you found out about this Foad?”</p>
				   
<p>Bambane Quossark, former detech, looked up from his console. “I’ve
checked the files, chief. Nothing in the last ten years, not for Remble
Foad. There was a Tharm Foad of Narpins Way, former physician, deceased
aged 84. No suspicious circumstances, no known surviving relatives. The
only other record in the same period is of Estrel Foad… just a moment…
yes, Estrel Foad, three years ago. A schoolgirl from Platport, then aged
13, parents Hablan and Aeris. Here for a fem cousin’s birthday party.
The two girls were both witnesses to a fracas outside Smigs in Yarp
Street. Three local youths later identified and apprehended, found to be
drunk and disorderly, and not in possession of nultox, which was duly
administered by a medtech. That’s about it.”</p>
				   
<p>“So, one natural death and one minor incident, but no leads to
Remble, or why he would need ice. What kind of person needs ice? Any
ideas, team?”</p>  
				   
<p>Possins, still inwardly smarting, was concentrating intently on his
screen. Hofft looked around the other team members, who obliged with
useful suggestions. </p>
				   
<p>“Fishmongers.”</p>
				   
<p>“Skaters.”</p>  
				   
<p>“A sculptor.”</p>
				   
<p>“Cocktail-makers.”</p>
				   
<p>“Someone with a head injury, or a hanging basket?” This last
submission came from Purlie Norpwit, who was the team’s first-aid
specialist.</p>	   
				   
<p>“You mean someone who has banged their head on a basket?”</p>
				   
<p>“No. Well, possibly. But aside from applying to bruises, using ice is
a convenient way to water hanging plants. Safer than trying to reach up
with a watering can, and the water gets absorbed slowly. I saw it on a
vid.”</p>		   
				   
<p>“I see, very practical. Well, all plausible, men and fems, but we
need corroborative background. It might be worth delving further back in
the files, but if this ice-seeking Foad is from outside Snoak, it’s
beyond our jurisdiction. Unless whoever is carrying that banner ceases
to do so peacefully, in which case the dye will, so to speak, be cast.”
Hofft nodded meaningfully towards the bank of pod control switches. </p>
				   
<p>A happy yap from Sevrel Possins signified that he had made a
discovery.</p>	   
				   
<p>“EPL, sir. The Ecological Protection League. Local offices in
Brangdurp Street. They’ve found some snails and a newt, and they’re
worried about effluent.”</p>
				   
<p>Welkin Hofft waited, eyebrow raised, inviting further
information.</p>   
				   
<p>“In Gunder’s Bight. Endangered species, they say. Tiny water-snails,
and a small grey-banded newt. And there’s historical evidence of nesting
grebe, which means there must once have been fish, but they think there
might be slow contamination from both the brewery and the
glassworks.”</p>   
				   
<p>“That might explain the smell,” said Hofft, for whom an interest in
the wonders and diversity of nature was not altogether natural, but he
was broadminded enough to allow that others might have such concerns.
“Good work! Would you say they pose a threat?”</p>
				   
<p>“They’re endangered, sir, not dangerous.”</p>
				   
<p>“Not the snails, Possins! Those Eco people, out there in the streets.
<i>‘Join the fight…’ </i> That sounds to me like a possible incitement
to violence.”</p>  
				   
<p>“I doubt if they mean it literally. It’s just an attempt to gather
support.” He peered at the screen in front of him and magnified the
image of those clustered around the banner in question. They were of all
ages, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. He saw faces he was sure he
recognized: the charming assistant from the Accessories place in Welfage
Road, the old neatly-bearded librarian wearing one of his trademark
cravats, the Laggabard twins with brightly beribboned berets… “They look
harmless enough, sir.”</p>
				   
<p>“So does Quossark, but bear in mind that as a detech he was trained
to disarm an attacker in less than a second using no more than a single
finger or a handful of bread.”</p>
				   
<p>Possins, who had been unaware of this, turned to look with renewed
respect at his habitually mild-mannered colleague, and could not help
glancing nervously at the man’s sandwich box, which lurked on its usual
shelf below the console. Quossark, with a sheepish grin, raised his
lethal hands in an unconvincing gesture of humility.</p>
				   
<p>“Well,” said Hofft, we’ll keep an eye on them, but let’s assume for
now that these Ecos do not have combat skills. Now, I’d like a closer
view of whoever’s carrying the Foad banner.”</p>
				   
<p>“It’s changed, chief!”</p>
				   
<p>“Changed? How?”</p>
				   
<p>“See for yourself.”</p>
				   
<p>The banner, drooping between two arm-weary bearers, their features
concealed by hat-brims, now read: </p>

<p class=middle><span class=impactfont20>J</span><span
class=impactfont18>U</span><span class=impactfont20>S</span><span
class=impactfont18>T </span><span class=impactfont16>F</span><span
class=impactfont18>O</span><span class=impactfont22>AD!</span>
</p>

<p>Hofft was not Head of CenSec for nothing. Experience brought
occasional insights. “I think we can forget about the ice. Drop that pod
to a shallower angle. I want to see that banner more clearly.”</p>

<p>Gradually, the message resolved itself:</p>

<p class=middle><span class=impactfont16>J</span><span
class=impactfont18>U</span><span class=impactfont20>ST </span><span
class=impactfont20>I</span><span class=impactfont18>C</span><span
class=impactfont20>E FO</span><span class=impactfont18>R </span><span
class=impactfont20>R</span><span class=impactfont22>EM</span><span
class=impactfont20>BL</span><span class=impactfont16>E F</span><span
class=impactfont18>O</span><span
class=impactfont22>AD!</span></p> <p>“Ah!” said Hofft.
“That makes more sense. Or rather, it would if we knew who he was, and
what sort of justice was required. And of course why.”</p>

<p>“I know it’s not in our remit to interfere without due cause,
chief….” ventured Quossark. </p>
				 
<p>“I have a hunch that you are about to make a hypothetical point.”</p>
				 
<p>“Well, if we really needed to obtain that knowledge, the people most
likely to provide it would be...”</p>
				 
<p>“…the demonstrators themselves. In fact, probably those carrying that
banner, provided that they have not been anonymously bribed to do so.
Yes, I realise that, Quossark, but in this department the code
stipulates that unless there is verifiable evidence of an imminent or
actual breach of security, or a serious threat to public welfare, we can
only observe. And continue searching the files. It pays to be
methodical, even though it’s not always the easiest option. Any
subsequent implementation, as you know, lies with your former detech
colleagues. After all, that’s why they’re known as the Action Faction.”
</p>

<p>Purlie innocently asked the question that had secretly been bothering
Hofft. “What about this Uncle Glussog and his Talent Parade, sir? There
seem to be quite a few of them, mostly young adults, I would say.”</p>
				
<p>“Ah, yes, Uncle Glussog. Indeed.” </p>
				
<p>Hofft pursed his lips, and stared, frowning up at a familiar trailing
speckled cluster of marks on the ceiling. They had been there since he
joined CenSec, possibly caused by an accident with a fizzy drink. He was
unaware that in times of stress he used them as a focus for his
thoughts. They looked like a group of islands on a map; a peaceful
archipelago where he could seek inspiration or solace. In view of
Hofft’s years of experience, and the respect he believed he had earned,
he was most reluctant to admit to his colleagues that he was baffled by
the ‘Uncle Glussog’ brigade. He presumed it must be related to some
recent vidfad, perhaps something trendily technical, disguised as
entertainment for the under-fours.</p>
				
<p>Hofft dragged his gaze away from the ceiling and back to Purlie. He
knew she had a little boy, Irvel, so would have more reason to be up to
date with the pros and cons of portable gadgetry for the young.	
Therefore it would hardly be wrong of him to refer the matter back to
her.  Would it?</p>
			   
<p>He tried to adopt an avuncular air. “Well, about this Talent Parade
thing, Purlie. What do <i>you</i> make of it?” </p>
			   
<p>“Me?” Purlie shrugged. “Well, sir, to be honest, I don’t believe I’ve
heard of Uncle Glussog, and I can’t quite make out what sort of talent
is being paraded.”</p>
			   
<p>“That’s a relief!” said Quossark, slamming his hand down on the edge
of the console with lethal insouciance. “I was hoping it wasn’t just
me.” </p>	   
			   
<p>Possins coughed politely. “There’s no mention of a Glussog in the
records, sir. I took the liberty of checking. Whoever it is, unless you
have privileged information, no-one here at CenSec knows anything about
him.”</p>	   
			   
<p>“Privileged? No, no, I was just, um, confirming that we were all on
the same screen.” </p>
			   
<p><i>Time to rally the troops</i>, thought Welkin Hofft. “Now, we are
the body principally responsible for the safety of the citizenry of
Snoak, are we not?”</p>
			   
<p>His team expressed its fervent agreement. </p>
			   
<p>“Throughout the year we maintain order, we respond to alerts, we
carry out surveillance when necessary, and to the best of our ability
ensure that on the streets of our city no person causes harm to another.
Correct?”</p>  
			   
<p>“Absolutely, chief!”</p>
			   
<p>“So if someone, for whatever reason, were to organize a public
display under a name that none of us is familiar with, either we are not
doing our job properly…”</p>
			   
<p>There was an offended grumble of dissent.</p>
			   
<p>“…or, that same someone – or group of someones - is deliberately
mocking us, trying to trick us into wasting time chasing ghosts and
shadows.”</p>  
			   
<p>“Whoa, chief. You think this whole thing might be a distraction while
they’re plotting something else?” Quossark looked ready to exercise his
hidden skills at a moment’s notice.</p>
		
<p>“Not plotting, Quossark, but perpetrating! That’s the threat we may
be facing. With all these people out of their homes, half of Snoak lies
vulnerable to trespass and burglary, and who knows what else?”</p>
		
<p>Fired with enthusiasm, disregarding that the question might have been
rhetorical, the team speculated on other dire possibilities:</p>
		
<p>“Arson!”</p>
		
<p>“Reckless commission of graffiti!”</p>
		
<p>“Vandalism!”</p>
		
<p>“….and all manner of wilful, um….</p>
		
<p>“Malfeasance?”</p>
		
<p>“Yes, that will do.”</p>
		
<p>Hofft sanctioned the deployment of four further recon pods to cover
all residential sectors of the city, ensuring that there would be
continuous monitoring while the demonstration was in progress. He
co-opted selected detechs who would be available to stand in for CenSec
team members if necessary. At the first hint of suspicious activity
Snoak’s culprit-catching net would be triggered. They would soon know
the identity of these subversives.</p>

<p class=middle><img src="./divider.jpg"></p>

<p class=drop>The device, which had used up all its inventor’s savings,
and had taken five difficult years to perfect, consisted of a shallow
cylinder, about the size of a large dinner plate, attached on either
side to a strong light-weight frame whose lower ends were held firmly in
a simple harness of hard-wearing cloth which strapped to the back. For
the upmarket version the cloth would be replaced by leather or whent. An
energator fitted neatly into a pouch in the belt. The top and periphery
of the cylinder were studded with very precise perforations. Concealed
within was a set of blades which could rotate at very high speed with a
hum that was barely audible. It hung above the head like a halo, and was
intended to deflect saturated air. It was his answer to those bent and
broken-strutted inside-out tendencies which in a strong wind turned even
the sturdiest umbrella into something resembling a severely disabled
crow.</p>

<p>Some years earlier, as a temporary expedient, he had found work at
the local factory. In the absence of any particular ambition he had soon
become accustomed to the routines of delivery and collection, and even
the occasional physical effort of helping to stack or retrieve heavy
drums of paint. He enjoyed the company of his fellow workers, especially
that of Tathia from the colour-matching department, whom he had cajoled
(or, stretching credibility, charmed) into marriage and motherhood.</p>

<p>To add family appeal, he decided to decorate his working prototype in
bright, prismatic colours. The paints he used were redundant test
samples from work, some of which, although intended for industrial use,
had already contributed over the years to the embellishment of otherwise
bland items of furniture. While the paint was drying he thought it was
about time he gave his device a name: something unfussy, but relevant.
His first proposal was <i>The Protector</i>, but that seemed both too
melodramatic and not specific enough. What was its actual function?
Basically, its job was to blow, but that particular combination of words
might be thought indelicate. Similarly, he felt it best to eschew
<i>air</i> and <i>head</i>, even though the wearer of one of these
devices could stay hands free and dry-headed in a monsoon or a
snowstorm. He needed to encapsulate the idea of avoiding getting wet. He
stared with a kind of unfocussed concentration at the colourful design.
What about… yes, that was it! A <i>Rainblow</i>. </p>

<p>The concept of the portable rain deflector had come to him during a
persistent spell of turbulent weather which had dampened their clothing
and their spirits for an entire week. For the first time in his life he
felt he had a goal of his own which was not only worth striving for, but
potentially achievable. He tried to share his excitement with Tathia,
whose attention at the time was largely taken up with the demands of
their infant son. He could not have known how costly it would be, or how
long it would take, working at night and at week-ends, mainly at the
kitchen table (for want of any other convenient surface), gradually
learning to refine each element of the design until he had the
optimal result with the most durable materials. Although he was
scrupulous about cleaning and tidying up after each session, his
obsessive tinkering led to domestic friction.</p>

<p>His wife had staunchly put up with the inconvenience as long as
possible, but it had caused a strain on their relationship which became
too much for her to bear. Tathia, in tears, had taken the boy, who was
too young to object, to stay with her sister in Platport, away from what
she referred to as “that awful contraption”, until things hopefully
returned to normal. He had let them go with a minimum of protest,
knowing that he was at fault, but resolved to see the development of his
device through to a conclusion. Remble Foad, native of Trevury,
assistant store manager for Swelfs Industrial Paints, abandoned, weary,
impoverished, now grimly determined, set about launching his
<i>Rainblow</i> on an unsuspecting world. </p>

<p>Having no experience of trying to market a new product against the
massed forces of established competition, Foad naturally sought advice
from supportive but equally inexperienced friends and colleagues, who,
despite their occasional teasing, knew how much this project meant to
him. </p>
	
<p>“Gonna cost thousands, Rem, old fella.” These encouraging words
emerged in a doleful rumble together with a radiant spatter of pastry
crumbs from the preoccupied mouth of Tyle Hutter, who supervised the
mixing vats. He was sturdily built, and the friendly arm that rested
briefly on Remble’s shoulders felt as ponderous as a limp dog. </p>
	
<p>“First y’ need to patn’t the thing,” said Appen Garch, sipping from
his mug. They were gathered in the factory canteen.</p>
	
<p>Foad looked puzzled. “You’ve seen the holo. It’s already
painted.”</p>
	
<p>“Not paint, patn’t. Get the design registrated by the patn’t people.”
He spoke with an air of casual authority, which only the better-informed
would think to question.</p>
	
<p>“Oh, right.” Foad was vaguely aware of this requirement, but not
altogether sure how to proceed.</p>
	
<p>“You’ll hafta find a lawyer,” declared Melgus Prant from Quality
Control.</p>
	
<p>Foad suffered a flutter of panic. They all knew about the recent
departure of his wife and child, which had left him feeling wretched and
vulnerable. Had Tathia said something about divorce? He was suddenly
very unsure. “A lawyer?”</p>
	
<p>“Someone who can get you prop’ly organized, do all the legal stuff
about, y’know, contracts an’ suchlike…”</p>
	
<p>“Ah, that kind of lawyer, yes, of course.” The feeling of panic
subsided, leaving a somewhat more tolerable sense of confusion.</p>
	
<p>Tyle Hutter had been thinking. “Tell you what you want, Rem,” he
announced in his confidential growl. “What you want is an
<i>investor</i>.” </p>
	
<p>There was general agreement that finding an investor would be a
useful step.</p>
	
<p>Back at home in front of his e-screen Foad began to realise that he
would definitely need help. The patent application alone would cost more
than he could afford. On the positive side he had found a substantial
list of potential investors offering to support new ideas. He ruled out
those who insisted on prior completion of the patent application, or
whose entries were full of forbidding terms like <i>traction</i> and
<i>scalability. </i>He made a note of those remaining few which had a
more reassuring approach, speaking of <i>trust</i> and <i>early stage
assistance</i> and <i>shared vision</i>. </p>
	
<p>Foad’s enquiries eventually led him to a local firm, The Select
Options Agency, where, on his first visit to their sparse but tasteful
office he was talked through each stage of the process by Jagmot Yives,
evidently a senior member of staff. Yives was polite, friendly and
reassuring, explaining that the agency’s high success rate depended on
knowing what to reject, and that this <i>Rainblow</i> design looked very
promising. With Remble Foad’s permission, the prototype would need to be
examined and tested by their technical specialists before they could
proceed further. If it passed as acceptable, the firm would then
undertake an exhaustive search for any similar existing patents among
the many thousands filed each year; a tedious but necessary task in
order to avoid any possible future legal difficulties. Foad understood
that these were sensible precautions. </p>
	
<p>Foad had duly delivered the prototype, and spent an anxious ten days
before receiving a call from the agency to say that the tests had been
most satisfactory. He was invited for a further appointment. The agency
proved sympathetic to Foad’s awkward financial position, and Yives
assured him that as evidence of their good will, they would make no
charge for the patent search, which could take a number of weeks. Yives
was about to return the prototype <i>Rainblow</i> to its owner’s
safekeeping, when he had a helpful afterthought. While waiting for the
completion of the search, unless Foad had any objection, the agency was
in a position to expedite matters by arranging to show the device to
some major distributors, and to explore with manufacturers the costs of
mass production. Foad thought this was an excellent idea. He was glad to
pass on the responsibility of the whole marketing issue to people with
the proper expertise. The burden, though very much of his own making,
was lifting at last.</p>
	
<p>Tathia and the boy had returned from Platport. Tathia was anxious to
settle back in, though Remble could sense she was still on her guard. In
contrast, his son Corm was unduly manic, seemingly driven by the same
impulse that sends cats dashing about in random directions. Remble tried
his best to atone for his previous neglect. He made conscientious
efforts to compensate for his long fixation on developing the
<i>Rainblow</i> by being more attentive to his wife
and son. Any further mention of the device was now confined to the
workplace.</p>									   
												   
<p>At the factory his workmates were happy to see that he was
appreciably less stressed. He had told them of his early dealings with
the agency, and they were all keen to hear of any further progress. It
was very nearly a month before Foad was called back to see Jagmot
Yives.</p>										   
												   
<p>At first the news was encouraging. The distributors had been
impressed, and had expressed definite interest, subject to satisfactory
legal requirements. The manufacturers the agency had consulted had the
capability of setting up automated production lines without extensive
re-tooling, thereby reducing costs, although the estimated initial
investment would still run to about half a million… Yives had paused,
and sighed.</p>
	 
<p>”Unhappily, Mr Foad, we have figuratively hit a brick wall. There is
no doubt that you have solved an age-old problem with a clever idea, but
the very fact that it is such a familiar problem means that of the many
others who have put their minds to this, some will have hit upon very
similar solutions, particularly in the light of today’s technology. And
so it proved, I’m afraid. There are no less than one hundred and
ninety-three patent applications for designs for rain deflectors
differing only in minor details from your own. That excludes the two
hundred and twelve thousand or so which contain no moving parts. So,
with great regret, we can proceed no further.” </p>
							  
<p>Remble Foad was numbly aware that this was not what he had envisaged.
He was distressed to see that Yives was close to tears at having to
deliver the information, and felt foolish at having had such high
expectations, and at the same time perversely relieved that it was all
over. As he retrieved what he now saw from Tathia’s viewpoint as his
‘awful contraption’, he thanked Yives for all the agency’s efforts on
his behalf. Yives, accompanying him to the door, courteously praised him
for his enterprise, sympathized with his disappointment, and wished him
well for the future. They shook hands solemnly. After a few steps Remble
turned back to wave, but Yives had already closed the door.</p>
							  
<p>During the following year only those acquainted with these events
might have regarded as suspicious firstly the unannounced closure of The
Select Options Agency in Trevury, and secondly the subsequent appearance
in well-known stores of the <i>Spindrip</i>: an apparatus remarkably
like the ill-fated <i>Rainblow</i>, fashionably available in an
assortment of colours and a choice of hard-wearing materials at prices
to suit even the most expensive tastes, and to judge by its growing
popularity, likely before long to supplant the obsolete umbrella. Among
those who smelled a corporate rat were Tyle Hutter, Appen Garch and
Melgus Prant. They were convinced that Rem, their good friend and fellow
worker, who had sacrificed so much for his invention, had been blatantly
cheated out of the rewards due to him. Even if Rem himself argued that
he had ‘moved on’, and would rather not have to be reminded about how
gullible he had been, they felt that he deserved better, and vowed to
take up his cause with the proper authorities. They were debating
exactly which authorities these might be when Melgus happened to mention
that he’d heard from his cousin Follick in Snoak, the one who kept
amphibians, that there was to be some kind of rally at the week-end,
starting in Fountain Square, and that everyone was welcome. This seemed
like too good an opportunity to miss. They would need a banner, of
course. Fortunately there was a large reserve of fabric offcuts at
Swelfs, and finding enough paint would definitely not be a problem.</p>

<p class=middle><img src="./divider.jpg"></p>


<p class=drop>Welkin Hofft was disconsolate. It was early evening. The
recon pods had been operating within visible wavelengths, but could
switch to other frequencies if needed. He was beginning to think it
might be a wasted effort. Members of his team had been monitoring all
residential areas of Snoak continuously, but there had been not the
slightest trace of criminal activity. Meanwhile the rally was still in
progress, although numbers had diminished as people went in search of
food or toilet facilities, or simply resumed their customary routines.
</p>

<p>Most of the Ecological Protection League’s followers had drifted off
in small groups, those with binoculars to a vantage point from where any
surviving wildlife in Gunder’s Bight could be observed until the light
faded, without requiring the involvement of nostrils. </p>
	 
<p>The Remble Foad contingent, apparently only a handful in number, were
seen to be animatedly engaging with anyone who would listen to them.
Possins had pointed out that during each encounter one of them would
make a curious twirling motion with a finger above his head, and
wondered whether this was a ritual gesture of some kind. Was Foad
perhaps the leader of a religious cult?</p>
	 
<p>The colourful capering of Uncle Glussog’s Talent Parade, whose
participants seemed to have inexhaustible energy, continued to attract
attention. <i>Who were these people?</i> Hofft was none the wiser.
Purlie Norpwit had scanned the media and entertainment database without
success.</p>
	 
<p>The team had ruefully concluded that they were in all likelihood just
young citizens having a good time. They might be behaving rather like
uninhibited children, but some of their more casual social interactions
indicated that they were beyond school age. The realisation struck Hofft
that they must be <i>students</i>, and because so many had appeared
early in the day they would not have travelled very far. He concluded
they must be from Sparagulan College, within sight of his office
windows. <i>But who was Uncle Glussog?</i> </p>
	 
<p>Was it, wondered Welkin Hofft, a kind of honorary title bestowed by
Sparagulan College, perhaps on a venerable member of their Drama
Department for services to <i>… something?</i> Hofft’s imagination
failed to supply a suitable achievement. He was not a devotee of the
theatre. He knew that the College had some arcane traditions dating back
centuries to the time of its founder, Aubec Sparagulan, who sprang from
a family of wealthy fruit merchants. Aubec had been equally fascinated
by botany and mathematics, and had written a famous book whose title
Hofft could not remember. He caught himself staring at those spots on
the ceiling again, and realised that his mind had wandered away from the
subject.</p>
	 
<p>Bambane Quossark, he of the lethal hands, who had a secret penchant
for crosswords, and a nagging feeling that they had missed a clue,
interrupted Hofft’s reverie.</p>
	 
<p>“Chief, I think the answer is in the banner. If I’m right, Uncle
Glussog is no more than a wild goose, or a red herring.”</p>
	 
<p>Hofft was still trying to recall the title of the book, and was
momentarily flummoxed.</p>
	 
<p>“How can he possibly be a bird, or a fi… Oh, you mean not an actual
person? Please explain.”</p>
	 
<p>“It’s just a hunch, chief, but I think we should try re-arranging all
the letters in that slogan to see if there’s a hidden message.”</p>
	 
<p>“So, ‘Uncle Glussog’s Talent Parade’ could be just a smokescreen?
Hmmm. Well, team, there’s a challenge for you all. Let’s have a crack at
this. The first person to find a plausible solution gets a free mug of
emberskelven at the Owl &amp; Skillet.”</p>
	 
<p>This was the first time that the CenSec team had been offered a
reward for taking time off to solve a word puzzle. They would almost
certainly have tackled it even without the added inducement. An
industrious silence fell, punctuated only by random grunts, sucking of
teeth and the odd plosive exhalation as the various team members applied
themselves to the problem.</p>
	 
<p>After about ten minutes Purlie Norpwit held up a page from her
notepad. “Sir, I think have something, but I’m not sure what it
means.”</p>
	 
<p>Hofft, whose own efforts had become stuck on the name CLASTER GALE,
tried to sound encouraging. “Go ahead, Purlie,”</p>
	 
<p>“Well sir, I was thinking there must be a clue here, and then I
noticed that you can make the word CLUE, and then I found A TANGLED
CLUE, which seemed promising, so I tried to find something meaningful in
the remaining letters, but all I came up with is STOPS GRANULES.”</p>
	 
<p>“A tangled clue stops granules,” Hofft murmured to himself. “A
tangled clue” is definitely a good start, but as for the granules, what
would they be? Sand? Salt? It’s a bit vague, I’m afraid, Purlie. Anyone
else? Not yet? Keep trying, team.”</p>
	 
<p>He returned to CLASTER GALE, and picked out PLANS TO. He was on to
something here!</p>
	 
<p>CLASTER GALE PLANS TO… what? Which letters had he not yet used?
D,E,G,N,S,U,U.</p>
	 
<p>Not a propitious selection. Wait! He spotted USE. CLASTER GALE PLANS
TO USE…</p>
	 
<p>Four letters left: D,G,N,U. There was only one word he could form
from those, but he really didn’t want to. Its implications were at best…
agricultural, and he decided, at least for the moment, not to share this
dubious triumph.</p>
	 
<p>Despite unusually fierce concentration over the next hour or so, the
others fared no better, being reluctant to claim success with phrases
that remained stubbornly cryptic. Sevrel Possins had produced what
looked like a mythical threat: DRAGONS PLAGUE CATTLE, UNLESS…</p>
	 
<p>Bambane Quossark, who enjoyed doing this sort of thing in his spare
time, had churned out several alternatives. These were:</p>
	 
<p>LEGLESS! – A DANGEROUS CUT PLANT</p>
	 
<p>CLOUDS AS GLUE: STRANGE PLANET </p>
	 
<p>A LOST NUDE GETS SLUNG A PARCEL</p>
	 
<p>Since this exercise had been his idea, he was increasingly irked that
these re-arrangements had little obvious relevance to Sparagulan College
or the students. He stared again at the words on the banner, and
experienced a moment of thrilling clarity. His hunch was justified. For
the last time, he wrote out the phrase in carefully spaced capital
letters:</p>
	 
<p>U N C L E G L U S S O G S T A L E N T P A R A D E</p>
	 
<p>Then he began to cross them off one by one, beginning with S for
Sparagulan, then C for College, and finally S for Students.</p>
	 
<p>He raised one of his lethal hands. </p>
	 
<p>“Chief, I’ve got a sudden dreadful thirst.”</p>

[*ITEM] Lost City

[*AUTHOR] D. S. White

[*BLURB] <b>"Solitary trees, if they grow at all, grow strong."</b> <br>
<small>Winston Churchill</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I told myself I was just going for a
casual hike across the countryside. I really didn’t want to think about
the fact that I was now an outcast and would never be allowed to return
to the safest place I knew on this planet. I tried to forget I'd ever
met them before, the people who had become my loyal crew on the voyage
from earth to this world. And who, for reasons I didn’t fully
understand, had cast me out after arriving here. I had done nothing to
harm any of them, least of all Sarah.</p>

<p>But still, she lingered in my mind, like the sunlight in the sky. I
couldn’t block her out. I just couldn’t forget the way she looked. I
didn't know if I'd ever see her again, and at this moment, forced to
fend for myself, I didn't want to think about it too much. I didn't want
to fall apart so close to home. I tried to remember the things I liked
the most about her, so if I never really saw her again, at least I could
always recall the way she sparkled when we first met.</p>
						  
<p>As I peered across the horizon, searching the landscape for a route
to follow, I felt the chilly breeze of winter coming on. Instead of
turning toward the dark city, I walked farther out into the countryside,
following what looked like a long abandoned trail. The trail curved
around the headstones of old graves, the homes of souls returned to the
netherworld long ago. These were the resting places of the first human
settlers on this planet. Why they’d all died before our arrival here was
a mystery I couldn’t care less about at the moment. I more
focused on finding something to eat.</p>
						  			 
<p>Eventually I found what I was looking for. Most everything that
remained in the garden had withered, as they'd stopped planting crops a
long time ago, leaving behind only seeds for the birds. I pinched off a
few shriveled vegetables and threw them inside my backpack, scarcely
wanting to think about how these morsels might be the last thing I ever
ate.</p>							 
									 
<p>I continued outward, away from the darkness of the city, away from
everything I knew. I had little interest in returning to my ship. I was
going to live on my own, where no one would ever find me again. I was
going to find a hole in the mountains and disappear there forever. </p>
									 
<p>A sort of magic overcame me, as often does when I’m by myself. I
hummed a soft tune and noticed things about this alien land I’d never
seen before. The air smelled cold, hinting of fresh snow falling in the
mountains. Sunlight filtered through my hands, curving around my
fingers, highlighting the blood and bones beneath my skin, but it failed
to warm me. I saw the colors of the changing season buried deep within
the texture of a fallen leaf and I pried it apart, looking for the
reason why I felt older today, but gave up soon when I found no
clues.</p>							 
									 
<p>Larger than life, the mountains in the distance loomed on the
horizon, an unbroken chain of snow-covered peaks. I counted seven
towering giants directly in front of me, monsters waiting to devour my
existence. A smaller ridge-line receded to the south, hinting the chain
of mountains went on forever. </p>	 
									 
<p>I spent most of the day walking toward them, but by evening the
mountains only appeared a little closer. I looked for somewhere to
sleep, with the sun going down. I came across a place where two large
trees had fallen in the shape of an X and I made a bed by crawling under
one of them and rolling back and forth in the tall grass growing there.
Then I lay a few withered tree branches against the tree trunks to break
the oncoming frigid night wind.</p>	 
									 
<p>From my backpack I pulled out the vegetable scraps I’d found in the
morning and ate them raw. There was really nothing else to eat. Inside
my backpack I also found a glass, which was useless because I didn’t
have any water. </p>				 
									 
<p>“You got any food?” I asked no one in particular, looking at the
empty world being sucked in by the spreading night.</p>
									 
<p>“No, I don't have any food,” I answered myself.</p>
									 
<p>In the morning I put on my backpack and started walking toward the
mountains again. A little later I came to a house, a mud house, which
had been made by hand out of wet earth pressed together, now hardened by
the sun over a long time. The house stood by the faint remains of a
road, nothing more than a wide path etched in the ground. As I went down
the road, I came across more mud houses, but whenever I looked inside
them, nobody was home.</p>			 
									 
<p>“Hello!” I called out to see if anyone still lived in this tiny
village in the wild, but only the cries of birds fleeing in panic
returned to me.</p>					 
									 
<p>The road ran across a stone bridge, merely the shadow of an arch
passing over the banks of what had once been a stream. It made me
realize how thirsty I was, as I peered down below. I jumped over the
edge of the bridge onto the dry bed and found it rock hard. Strange
shapes stuck in the dirt caught my attention and I kicked at one to see
what it was. It glimmered a little in the sunlight. </p>
									 
<p>The object was covered in dried mud, so I spit on it and wiped it
clean with my sleeve. As I did, a slight vibration passed through my
hand and I almost dropped it. Then I noticed the color of the rock. It
was blue. From side to side, the bottom of the stream was covered in
oddly shaped cubes, just like the one I was grasping in my hand. I was
standing in the middle of a bed of blue gems. When I took in how many of
these powerful gems there were here, I gasped.</p>
									 
<p>Yet I seemed immune to the negative effects of the blue gems. They
didn’t burn my skin, like they'd done to others I'd witnessed picking
them up. The longer I held one, the better I felt. My hunger faded and
my thirst no longer seemed to matter. My vision cleared and my thoughts
made sense again. I waited for a while, to see if anything else would
happen, but nothing did. Eventually I got tired of just standing there,
so I tossed the gem under the bridge and climbed back up to the
road.</p>							 
									 
<p>Inside the houses I began to find people, the remains of ancient
human skeletons lying in odd positions on the floor. Some of the
skeletons didn’t make any sense, with extra bones or twisted bones or
missing limbs. In one place I found two skeletons embracing each other.
And in another house, I found the remains of a girl whose dress had been
ripped open. Around her neck hung a silver chain with a stone embedded
in it. The stone was red, and so securely fastened to the chain that I
couldn’t pry it out. I picked up the girl’s head and tried to take the
chain off her neck and her skull came loose from her spine.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” I said and laid the jaw and other pieces back where they
might have belonged.</p>

<p>I thought I heard the sound of someone talking outside and I grabbed
the chain and ran out the door. But there was nobody there. I sat down
by the door to the house and thought about what it might have been like
to live here. I imagined people walking around, talking, laughing, and
then I thought I smelled something cooking. I saw a bird circling
overhead and felt myself growing weak with hunger.</p>

<p>I felt a little guilty for taking the chain and stone and thought
about returning it to the girl, but was too afraid to enter her house
again. But the chain and stone gave me an idea. I went back to the
bridge and found the blue gem that I’d left there. As I held it in my
hand, I felt myself come alive once more, as if the gem was a battery
recharging my soul. </p>

<p>I found a sharp rock and hammered on the necklace until the red gem
popped out. Then I put the blue gem in its place and hammered at the
chain until the gem was secure. After that, I hung the chain around my
neck. When I had finished, I pulled my shirt open and dropped the gem
inside, close to my skin, where nobody would see it. I felt warm all
over, even in the cold wind.</p>

<p>I thought I heard the sound of bells tinkling and I ran down the road
until I came to an intersection. Here skeletons were everywhere, not
just inside the houses, but also lying out in the village
square. I had to step carefully to get past them and it began to freak
me out. On the wind, I continued to hear odd tones, as if trumpets were
being played at a funeral procession for the dead.</p>

<p>“Who is it? What do you want?” I yelled, but nobody answered me.</p>

<p>I ran back the way I’d come, frantic now, afraid I'd die out in the
middle of nowhere and nobody would ever know what had become of me. I
pictured my skeleton laying here for centuries, until it was discovered
by accident.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me here!” I screamed at myself.</p>
					  
<p>When I realized I was talking to myself I gave up on the mountains. I
turned and looked back towards the dark city, just a smudge on the
horizon by now. As my desire to live in the wilderness withered into
thin air, I ran past the houses until I found the trail I had followed
to get here. I got a little disoriented in the tall weeds and lost the
trail, but kept pushing forward with the shadow of the city directly
ahead. I stopped running eventually, feeling dizzy and nauseous and
dehydrated, but forced myself to continue moving forward at a steady
pace.</p>			  
					  
<p>Things were not normal on this planet. When I turned and looked back
behind me, the village in the wild had disappeared completely. When I
looked up at the sky, I had no idea which day it was and I even began to
wonder how long I’d spent alone. I thought I’d been evicted from my ship
yesterday, but it might have been a hundred years ago. I clutched the
blue gem under my shirt and pushed it hard against my skin and the
dizziness went away.</p>
					  
<p>By noon I began to see signs of dwellings, old outposts long
abandoned. Yet I skirted the shadow of the city when I felt its presence
about to devour me, not wanting to go in there alone. It was strange,
the way every place was so empty. So dark. The city was completely
devoid of life. What had happened here I couldn’t say. </p>

<p>The road curved to the south, toward the place where I’d set down the
ship, the same place where I'd last seen Sarah. I straightened the
collar on my jacket and pulled my gloves on a little tighter. The sun
was up but the day was feeling colder by the second. And then I
stopped.</p>		  
					  
<p>Sarah was standing just up ahead. She smiled at me and waved. I
hurried over to talk to her.</p>
					  
<p>"What are you doing here?" I asked.</p>
					  
<p>"What they did to you to, I had to leave. I didn't know if I could
find you, but I couldn't stay there any longer."</p>
					  
<p>She tried to hug me but I backed up a step. "What?" she asked.</p>
					  
<p>I pulled the blue gem out of my shirt and showed it to her. "Better
not touch me. I don't know if it's safe."</p>
					  
<p>She nodded. She knew the blue gems were dangerous to most people. Why
I was immune, she didn’t ask. </p>
					  
<p>"I have a map," she said.</p>
					  
<p>"Let's take a look."</p>
					  
<p>After choosing a route, she put the map away. We started walking. We
were good traveling companions, not because we had a lot in common, but
more because we didn't talk much. The way I saw it, what had happened on
the ship wasn't a problem we needed to discuss. </p>
					  
<p>"Odds?" I asked.</p>
					  
<p>"Low," she replied.</p>
					  
<p>The city grew bigger as we got closer. I couldn't see anything wrong
with it from the outside. The buildings were still intact, for the most
part. Some of them looked a little aged. Few windows were broken. Most
of the doors were closed. It felt wrong to be walking into an empty city
of this size. At the perimeter, there weren't any warning signs, nothing
about toxic radiation, or the plague, nothing to say we needed to turn
back now. It was just empty, and yet, arranged in an odd but orderly
fashion.</p>

<p>When we arrived in the streets, that's when I noticed the more
peculiar things. In the windows, the ones that were still intact, in
just about every one of them was a skeleton. Even odder, these lifeless
figures all appeared to be looking in the same direction, directly at
me. I turned around and looked behind me but didn't see anything of
interest to warrant those empty faces turned in my direction.</p>
		  
<p>At one intersection I found a newspaper bin and after forcing it open
pulled out a stack of printed pages. The paper was crisp and new, like
it'd just come off the press. The date had to be 70 or more years ago—I
didn't exactly know today's date. I scanned the headlines on several
pages and discovered nothing alarming. A politician had been charged
with corruption. Still, that was no reason to have the population of an
entire planet go extinct.</p>
		  
<p>In one of the windows I saw a cat. It looked real enough, with fur
and wet eyes, but it had to be a fake. I watched it for a while as it
watched me. Or it appeared to be watching me. And then it blinked. I
grabbed Sarah's arm and pointed. </p>
		  
<p>"So?" she asked.</p>
		  
<p>"Food," I said.</p>
		  
<p>I wasn't about to eat a cat, but the cat, since it was truly alive,
had to have a source of food somewhere. We needed to find out more about
it.</p>	  
		  
<p>The cat turned and jumped down from the window sill and ran to the
front door. We shuffled across the street and opened the entrance to the
shop. The door hadn't been locked or damaged in any way. The cat ran to
my leg and began to purr. It was clearly familiar with typical human
interaction. It looked up in my eyes and meowed a meow of contentment. I
felt odd at that moment. The city waited silently all around us, empty;
those skeletons were everywhere, in every window, with the same
jaw-dropping expressions. And here was this cat, not afraid at all. </p>
		  
<p>We never did find anyone alive. We didn't find much food either and
eventually we had to abandon the city. Once we'd made it to the other
side, the land opened up for miles upon miles. We were free. We would
live another day. The crew of our ship would never follow us this far.
Before getting too distant from the city, though, I turned to look back.
Just like expected, in every window, an empty-eyed skull watched me. And
there, in one window, was a cat. A healthy cat. And those skeletons were
all attired for work, wearing suits and dresses. I couldn't forget about
that for a long time.</p>
		  
<p>Life wasn’t easy on this planet. The only people who could help me
right now had turned on me. My crew had committed mutiny. After seeing
the way blue gems turn people into monsters, and then noticing the way
they gave me power, nobody would come near me. They feared what they
didn’t understand, something they couldn’t control. I had to admit, I
feared myself a little as well. The changes taking place inside me,
something alien growing there, giving me strength but at the same time
turning me into a freak, it left me feeling confused. </p>
		  
<p>I thought I saw someone in the distance waving and I started to run,
but stopped before going too far. It was nothing more than a tree.
Leaves scattered in the wind and the world turned. I felt older. I felt
alone.</p>
		  
<p>“What?” Sarah asked after catching up.</p>
		  
<p>“Nothing,” I said. </p>
		  
<p> Behind us, the lost city had sunk lower on the horizon. All I could
think about was finding more food. But at least, I had Sarah. When I
turned to look at her, she sparkled like the sun. And when I looked up
ahead, where there were trees, I thought there might be fruit. We would
move forward, because moving on would bring us to tomorrow, and another
day was a chance at hope.</p>

[*ITEM]	The Aldous Effect

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark

one."</b><br><small> Albert Einstein</small>



[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I
stood in a darkened doorway, waiting for
The Man. New Year fireworks lit up the downtown sky but I tried to
ignore them. Some of the rockets looked too much like tracer for my
liking and I needed no reminder of combat.

The Man slid out of the shadows, all
gabardine coat and broad-brimmed hat. “Mister G, always a pleasure.
What will it be this time?” He had a rich basso profundo voice that
sounded like life itself was a constant source of amusement. </p>
				
<p>My palms were slick with sweat as I took a surgical transfer packet
from my jacket pocket and held it out. “I have this. Fresh human liver.
Still viable.”</p>
				
The Man inspected my offering and ached an eyebrow. “Healthy? Since when
did they trash prime rib like this?”

I shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. “I doctored the harvesting
report to give the donor a history of alcohol abuse. After that no
transplant team would touch his organs with a ten-foot pole. This was
destined for the incineration chute, no nobody will miss it.” I licked
my lips. “I figure it’s good for four rocks?”

“Four? That’s being a bit generous.” He laughed at my obvious
nervousness. “What the hell, it <i>is</i> New Year, after all, and
you’re a steady customer. Four it is.”

The Man pocketed the liver and
held out four small packets. Not so much
‘rocks’ as small chrome yellow gelatine squares, like dishwasher
tablets. He tipped his hat. “Be seeing you Mister G. Be seeing you
<i>real</i> soon.”

And I was alone.
				
<p>After my third tour I was done; invalided out of the Army due to
PTSD. Just another college boy who couldn’t handle the brutal reality of
combat. They shipped me home but I brought the battlefield with me;
sleeping in a booby-trapped apartment, always armed, barely able to hold
down a job – pretty much the poster boy for crippling anxiety. Treatment
provided by the Veterans’ Association didn’t cut it so I started
self-medicating - sliding from conventional narcotics to the truly
esoteric in little under a month. Then I heard about ‘Hux’, a street
drug that offered a whole new perspective on life.</p>
				
<p>Man, did they get <i>that</i> right.</p>
				
<p>The calmness I got from using Hux came at a price, but one worth
paying. I was on the ebb of my previous hit, starting to feel prickly
around the edges. Looking at the rocks made me shiver with anticipation,
too distracted to notice that the flickering light on the wall wasn’t
simply glare from a distant sky burst.</p>
				
<p>“Edward, this is so <i>wrong</i>. You <i>do</i> know that, don’t
you?” </p>		
				
<p>I thrust the rocks into my coat pocket and grabbed the handle of my
revolver - but it was only a Tinker Bell and nothing I couldn’t handle.
The fairy wafted into my field of vision, surrounded by a blue glow that
stung my eyes.</p>
				
<p>“I’m <i>so</i> disappointed in you, I really am.”</p>
				
<p>I know how that sounds, and given the drugs I’d tried, there were
times when I <i>knew</i> I was hallucinating - and times I <i>hoped</i>
I was.</p>		
				
<p>This was neither. </p>
				
<p>Because what Hux does is let you see Desire, Conscience and all the
boys in the band – for real. Not that it reduced morality to a mere
spectator sport but these were definitely the <i>&uuml;ber</i>
manifestations of motivation, duking it out to see who’ll hold sway –
and you can forget the ‘subconscious’ aspect.</p>
				
<p>No, <i>really</i>. </p>
				
<p>My personal moral gladiators presented as an eclectic mix drawn from
childhood storybooks and pubescent fantasies - hence Tinker Bell. From
past experience the fairy was nippy but if it came down to it my
revolver was packing beehive rounds with the same spread as a shotgun.
Although blowing her away would have been easy-peasy I didn’t want
another dead Conscience on my conscience - and I <i>really</i> didn’t
want a Jiminy giving me grief instead. </p>
				
<p>So I just smiled and showed my empty hands. “How’s things, doll? The
Moral Majority still treating you right?”</p>
				
<p>She frowned. “This isn’t about me, Edward, it’s about your actions
and the consequences they entail. I strongly advise you to turn yourself
in and make a clean breast of it to the authorities. You know you’ll
feel all the better for it.”</p>
				
<p>As I groped for the right platitude the shadow of a burnt-out street
light began to lengthen, undulating over the tarmac towards Tinker Bell.
I stepped back, hoping to draw her away from it. “Look, T, you know me,
I’m the archetypal bad boy. How about we just agree to differ and go our
separate ways? I’m sure there are some lost souls out there you could
actually save, but me, hell, I’m <i>way</i> beyond help.”</p>
				
<p>But she just fluttered there; hands on tiny hips, her face the
picture of earnest dedication. “Now, Edward, that’s being defeatist.
Everyone has good in them, no matter how deep down, and-”</p>
				
<p>The shadow morphed into a 3-D striking serpent, jaws wide open. I
closed my eyes against the horror of it all, but couldn’t block out the
<i>crunch</i> and grinding of miniature bones. By the time I risked
taking a peek the shadow was retreating back to the base of the lamp
post and I was in deep shit, if only by proxy. Glancing up I knew there
was now a hole in the sky with my name on it, and wondered if simply
running away was a viable option. Except, of course, the one person you
can’t escape from is yourself.</p>
				
<p>Still, there’s nothing wrong with getting a good head start.</p>
				
<p>So I bailed, heading in the general direction of <i>away</i>, but had
barely gone a hundred yards when a sensual slither of movement across my
shoulders pulled me up short. The serpent coiled around my neck,
whispering in my ear. “You need a top-up, Eddie, you know you do.
There’s no harm in that. It’s New Year, after all.”</p>
				
<p>Desire, well <i>my</i> Desire, sounded like Fenella Fielding, an
old-school actress I’d watched on the Vintage channel. She had a husky,
sexy voice that made my balls twitch and a way of derailing my train of
thought. I plucked at my scaly temptress but she lengthened, encircling
my chest and stomach, sliding between my legs.</p>
				
<p>“You’re not the boss of me.” I tried for dismissive arrogance but
lust made my voice thick and guttural. My erection was a bar of
iron.</p>		
				
<p>She laughed; a throaty chuckle. “For now I am. We both know that, so
why struggle? Let’s just enjoy the evening for what it is.” A forked
tongue caressed my earlobe.</p>
				
<p>I shivered. “OK, OK, I’ll do it.”</p>
				
<p>“Like you ever had a choice, Eddie? Be seeing ya.”</p>
				
<p>And I was alone.</p>
				
<p class=drop>I needed a cold shower but a couple of deep breaths had to
do. My hands shook as I fumbled a rock from pocket to mouth, and chewed.
This one tasted of liquorice, but the effect was always the same;
welcome to the high-def world, surround sound, front-row seat
guaranteed.</p>
				
<p>Reality as an addiction.</p>
				
<p>I gathered my jacket around me and headed for The Quarter; stepping
out, a man on a mission. Each hit of Hux had a side-effect, a real
doozie; one that allowed me to fund a lifestyle way beyond that of a
lowly medical technician. </p>
				
<p>For the next few hours I’d be the unluckiest man on the planet.</p>
				
<p>I’m not talking about a litany of woe, no, rather I’d be the King of
Losers, sucking up good luck from those around me. It’s akin to the
proverbial broken mirror – all that bad news has to come from
<i>somewhere</i>, and the glass does it by absorbing misfortune from
random individuals in the vicinity. Well, I’m the opposite, the inverse
Midas touch, and casinos, man, they goddam <i>love</i> me. </p>
				
<p>So I hustled over to Pelham House, on Matheson, where they paid me a
retainer to show up, sit in, and ruin everyone’s evening. Games where
the house won by default, of course – so if I played roulette everyone
else might as well flush their chips down the crapper and save
themselves some time and disappointment. </p>
				
<p>I scurried along, keeping to back streets and alleyways, clinging to
the shadows, avoiding the general population wherever possible. Even so
I was probably responsible for two broken high heels, one set of keys
down a drain and a fender-bender before reaching the casino parking lot.
I stopped and sighed, feeling relatively safe amongst the field of
inanimate objects.</p>
				
<p>Strike that last comment.</p>
				
<p>Doubt was waiting for me; a weasly-voiced weasel perched on the roof
of a ’69 Chevy. “You <i>do</i> know they’re ripping you off, right? I
mean, you don’t even get a percentage of what the house makes off your
talent. Talk about selling yourself short.”</p>
				
<p>I sniffed. “I get by.”</p>
				
<p>“You get screwed, that’s what you get. They see you coming, put on a
false smile, take you for a ride. All those suits, laughing at you
behind closed doors.”</p>
				
<p>“Leave him be, he’s mine tonight.” Desire lay coiled around the hood
ornament, dangling tail twitching like an angry cat.</p>
				
<p>Doubt bared his yellow teeth. “You wish! Eddie here is a born loser,
and he knows it. All <i>you</i> do is get him into situations where
failure cuts even deeper.”</p>
				
<p>“I said <i>back off</i>, flea-bag.” </p>
				
<p>“Bite me!”</p>
				
<p>Man, talk about the wrong choice of words. Desire not so much lunged
as lengthened, surging forwards with unhinged jaws at least a foot wide.
Doubt chittered at her, then back-flipped from roof to fender, from
fender into the back of a Dodge pickup. His small paw appeared above the
tailgate, single ‘finger’ extended – and was gone. The serpent hissed a
raspberry in his direction, then slid down over the trunk and vanished
into the tailpipe. </p>
				
<p>Score one for greed-fuelled self-confidence, I guess.</p>
				
<p>I shivered, wiped a slick of sweat from my face, and hustled
diagonally cross the parking lot to the employee’s entrance. ‘Ready to
Rumble’ Ron was on the door – a former wrestler with biceps the size of
my thighs. Although he was no more than muscle in a cheap suit the
contempt in his voice was obvious as he used his hand-held radio.</p>
				
<p>“Boss? This is Ron. The loser is here. He’s juiced-up, but looks like
shit. What you want me to do?” There was a burble of speech in reply
that I didn’t catch. Ron nodded. “I’m on it.” He looked me up and down.
“Hit the showers. There’ll be a change of clothes waiting for you when
you’re done. Don’t soil them or we’ll bill you for the dry
cleaning.”</p>	
				
<p>Ron didn’t stand aside, forcing me to squeeze past him and into the
dingy service area that belied the plush splendour of the main salon.
The few croupiers, hostess girls and barmen on break didn’t spare me a
second glance as I sidled into the changing rooms. I rated a locker, if
not an actual lock, and quickly exchanged my clothes for a semi-soiled
towel fresh from the sauna. However my three remaining rocks posed a
problem. I’d never brought my stash to work before and couldn’t risk
hiding them while bathing. Plus I didn’t want to risk their soft shells
melting under the shower.</p>
				
<p>The bravado that had brought me here without thinking things through
played the ‘What’s the worst that can happen?’ card. I crammed all three
rocks into my mouth – and regretted the decision even before Regret had
time to put in an appearance. Every hair, every skin pore, every taste
bud exploded like the worst amphetamine hypersensitivity <i>ever</i>. I
staggered to the shower and slammed the heat setting all the way up.
Near-scalding water made me scream but this was the ‘pain gate’ approach
to sensory overload. In any event my jaw was clenched so tight all that
came out was a low burbling wail.</p>
				
<p>Agony became pain became discomfort. I emerged to a world that
demanded my attention but wasn’t about to make me its bitch. What I
needed was a dark, sound-proofed room and a glass of tepid water.
Unfortunately Mister Morden – the ‘Boss’ – wasn’t someone a sane man
wanted to annoy. </p>
				
<p>There was a suit hanging on my locker door, although no shirt and
tie, and my own wouldn’t pass muster. So I scored one of the black
roll neck sweaters worn by the doormen, hoping for suave and debonair
with a hint of mystery. Instead what I saw in the full-length mirror was
Peter Lorre slumming it as a Bond henchman. Somewhere close by I heard
Doubt snigger, but I was safe behind my Hux firewall.</p>
				
<p>Time to be a living spoiler.</p>
				
<p class=drop>The main salon was all deep-pile carpets and subdued
lighting, home to that distinct murmur you get when money is changing
hands. Bryce, one of the floorwalkers, appeared at my elbow and hustled
me aside. </p>
				
<p>His voice was a nervous whisper, which wasn’t like him at all. “Now
listen up, freak, and listen good. We got some dame burning up the main
wheel, big time. She’s into us for over three-hundred grand and wants to
go no-limit. We can’t back down without appearing gutless, and you know
that ain’t Mister Morden’s style. So called a pause, bringing in some
other high-rollers, and you better get in there and fix things,
yeah?”</p>		
				
<p>There was a snivelling Fear on his shoulder, whispering in his ear -
an indistinct twist of shadow, draining blood from his face like there
was a tap running. Usually I can’t see the <i>&uuml;bers</i> on other
people
but I guess my overdose had opened the doors of perception. </p>
				
<p>I shook free of his grasp. “Don’t crowd me, man! You know I got
personal space issues.”</p>
				
<p>“You screw this up and your next ‘personal space’ will be a shallow
grave, buster. Get me?”</p>
				
<p>Bryce was a thug, a bully, but just then he had all the menace of
some hopeless dweeb at his first Senior Prom. I grinned, turned on my
heel and walked off, leaving him shaking like a leaf. I felt good,
confident, ready to terminate even the strongest winning streak –
terminate it with extreme prejudice. Then one of those random gaps you
get in crowds opened up, giving me a clear view across the room to the
main roulette table.</p>		
				
<p>Shock.</p>	
				
<p>And awe.</p>	
				
<p>The woman stood out against the background like an old-school
Evangelical preacher, as if outlined in neon. Not beautiful, no, but
handsome, even with her strong features half-hidden behind wraparound
dark glasses. She wore her hair piled high, which added to the whole
‘Classical goddess’ look fostered by a Grecian-front evening dress in
pearl silk. Only as I approached the table did I notice the white cane
carried in her left hand. </p>
				
<p>She was blind.</p>
				
<p>Powerful fingers dug into my shoulder, making me wince. “Glad you
could join us, Ed. For a moment there I thought you weren’t going to
honour our little agreement, and you know how I <i>abhor</i>
disappointment.” It was Mister Morden in person, surrounded by the smell
of bourbon and peppermints. </p>
				
<p>I half-turned my head towards him while keeping my eyes fixed on my
fixation. “That’s her? That’s the mark?”</p>
				
<p>He grunted. “Damn straight. Right, I’ll set this up and let you do
your thing. Your chips are waiting at the table. Nothing fancy, mind,
just take her for everything she’s got.”</p>
				
<p>Morden ushered me forward and launched into the formalities,
apologising for the delay. The woman listened politely then turned so
that we were facing each other across the table. “My, my, Mister Edward
Glass, I do declare. It is <i>such</i> a pleasure to meet you at last,
sir.” She had a Southern Belle accent but nothing I could pin down.</p>
				
<p>I gave her a half-bow, conscious of Morden’s eyes boring into me.
“I’m sure, ma’am, that the pleasure is entirely mine.” </p>
				
<p>“Place your bets, ladies and gentleman, place your bets. As per
mutual agreement this is now a no-limit table.” Gibson, the croupier,
looked to the lady. “Ma’am?” </p>
				
<p>She smiled, displaying perfect teeth. “How much do I have
available?”</p>	
				
<p>His gaze flickered over the stack in front of her. “Ah, three-hundred
and twenty-five thousand.”</p>
				
<p>“Be so kind as to place everything on twenty-six, black. Thank
you.”</p>		
				
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd clustered around the table; players
and onlookers alike. Gibson looked to Morden who nodded; a barely
perceptible move of his head. The croupier slid the chips into place and
stepped back smoothly. The other players around the table followed suit,
until there had to be nearly three-quarters of a million in play. As
this was real shit-or-bust territory I took a deep breath, placed my
entire stack on ‘Even’, and… </p>
				
<p>…and I knew who she was.</p>
				
<p>The room became hazy, indistinct, leaving only the two of us. I
stared at the Southern Belle. “But if you’re my Lady Luck then how can
others see you, hear you?”</p>
				
<p>She laughed. “It really is a case of people making their own, Edward.
They generate it, gamblers and gunmen more than others, and you gather
it to yourself. I’m the result of that concentration, the focus of
countless hopes and fears. After this win I’ll be no mere
personification but a true Goddess, restored. After this win there’ll be
no more good fortune apart from what <i>I</i> choose to bestow upon
Humanity. You’ll be hailed as a new Zeus, Edward. Or cursed.” </p>
				
<p>Reality returned before I had time to reply, or even think of some
witty rejoinder. Gibson spun the roulette wheel and flicked the ball in
the other direction. “No more bets, ladies and gentlemen, no more
bets.”</p>		
				
<p>I felt it; I felt chance itself draining from the room into me,
through me, vanishing from the world. Luck is a consequence of free will
– the Universe balancing out self-determination with randomness. What
brave new world would be there be without <i>that</i>? </p>
				
<p>The croupier cleared his throat. “<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>”</p>

<p>Our spherical Damocles danced, bounced, as we held our collective
breath...</p>

<p> ...and fell.</p>
