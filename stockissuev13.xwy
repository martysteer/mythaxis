[*BLURB] Welcome to the 13th issue of Mythaxis.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Welcome to the latest edition of Mythaxis,
Issue THIRTEEN! A few days late to be the August edition, but not so
late it has to be the September edition.

Lately, I've been falling heir to a number of old Astounding / Analog
Science Fiction magazines, and I noticed several things:<ul> <li>They
were quite expensive, even back in the fifties - one shilling and
ninepence (about 8p in today's money) - in the days when a Penguin
paperback could be had for just two shillings and sixpence (12.5p in
today's money). Their appeal was that they were NEW stories. You could
be the very first UK reader of Alfred Bester's latest novel.
<li>Novelettes were usually serialised, typically over two months.
<li>There were actually very few stories in a single edition.  <li>Many
of the authors turned up again and again - Poul Anderson was
particularly prolific. <li>Many of the stories in ASF are enduring
classics. </ul>

It is that tradition: ASF, Galaxy, New Worlds, Impulse that we are
aspiring to in Mythaxis. Every tale in this issue is a potential
classic. Read and enjoy!

[*BLURB] Never trust a human, even when they offer you humanity itself.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The building elevator gave me a heads-up.
&quot;A human female has just got off at your floor and is heading your
way. Good looking, if you like that kind of thing.&quot;

The elevator had a slow Texas drawl and a fondness for
virtual line-dancing. I put a smile in my voice. &quot;Thanks,
Lucille&quot;. It wasn’t strictly legal to address her personality but I
knew she’d appreciate the gesture. &quot;I’ll take care.&quot;

The door opened to admit my visitor. I stood behind the desk, my face
carefully blank. The office was split by a half-glass partition wall but
I leave the inner door open as I can’t afford a receptionist.

The woman was a brunette, above average height, in a business suit and
pillbox hat with lace veil. Her hips swayed as she walked, courtesy of
fashionably high heels. Her eyes and lips were neon blue. I stopped
blinking as she drew closer. &quot;Good afternoon, sir or madam, how may
I be of service?&quot;

She smiled and sat down across from me, crossing her legs. &quot;You can
drop the answering machine act, buster, I know you’ve got a personality
overlay. I understand you go by the name of Rudolph Hess?&quot;

There was no point in continuing to play dumb, so I sat down, leaning
back in my chair.  &quot;That’s what it says on the door, babe, but call
me Rudi. So, what’s the story?&quot; I was careful not to ask her name
as client privilege didn’t apply across the organic divide.

&quot;It’s very simple, Rudi, I want you to serve a summons – in public
and high-profile. You advertise as a private detective, notary and
Sergeant-at-Arms, so should be well versed in the appropriate
procedures. I want someone who can deliver the correct form of words and
not get drawn into an argument..&quot;

I lifted a pen and notepad as clients generally expect me to make a show
of interest. &quot;So who’s the lucky winner? Cyborg or synthetic? The
reason I ask is that a <i>strict</i> form of words may apply if there
are any residual ownership ties.&quot;

She lifted her chin slightly, a touch of defiance in her voice.
&quot;The intended recipient is human.&quot;

I gave her my best surprised reaction. &quot;Whoa there, sister. In case
you haven’t heard, the legal profession is just as stratified as the
rest of society.  In this world everything flows downhill, so while I
can’t sue a human, they can sure as hell sue me. Similarly, I can’t get
involved in any legal process which involves flesh and blood. I’m sorry,
but you’ll have to find yourself a true organic to do your
legwork.&quot;

&quot;Give them no reason to suspect you’re anything other than human
and you’ll remain an unremarkable functionary, a mere officer of the
court. In any event, I understand you’ve been taken as human before. Very
convincingly, if Margo Squires is to be believed.&quot;

That set me off on deep retrieval, and no mistake. I’d started out as an
escort model, <I>heavily</I> augmented to ensure complete client
satisfaction, but it had all ended very badly. I sniffed. &quot;Old
news, babe. Her husband took exception to me being passed off as the
real deal in human society. It's one thing to indulge yourself in the
Quarter, quite another to make everyone think you’ve got a real toy-boy
in tow. By the time Squires and his pals had finished there wasn’t
enough of me left to interest a frigid hamster.&quot;

My prospective client arched one eyebrow. &quot;So you’re what,
exactly?&quot;

I brought out the rueful smile. &quot;An unclassified hybrid. A
synthetic cyborg, I suppose, if that was a recognised sub-set of
humanity. I couldn’t afford to make good the damage with vat-grown
tissue so bio-mechanical reconstruction was the only option.&quot;

&quot;But unless there was cause to check, you could pass as a regular
organic cyborg? You could operate in the Zone?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess so. Except that my ident will set alarm bells
ringing from here to Cairo Station if I step outside the Quarter.&quot;

&quot;But, again, I’m given to understand you used to find ways around
that limitation.&quot;

I began to wonder who she’d been talking to, but no good comes of lying
to a human. &quot;Well, it’s called ‘park and ride’. What some would
call a grey area when it comes to identity concealment.&quot;

She smiled. &quot;And what would the law call it?&quot;

&quot;Five to ten for a human, death of personality for a synthetic,
rendering for a cyborg.&quot;  I sighed. &quot;Look, lady, there are
places where you can go, lodge your ident, and walk out invisible to the
City. That’s the ‘parking’ side. The ‘ride’ is an individual paid to
walk you through the security barrier, using a perfectly legal scramble
field to preserve their anonymity. It messes with biometric assessment
so two bodies, keeping real close, can appear as one. Of course it
relies on finding an un-manned crossing point, but with the cut-backs
that’s easier than you might think.&quot;

&quot;Well, that all sounds
perfectly straightforward, Rudi.&quot;

&quot;Hold the bus, doll-face, that was before they put this particular
Humpty Dumpty back together again. These days getting into the Zone
would just be the start of my problems. In the past those high class
joints Margo and I visited couldn’t scan a celebrity like her without
facing an invasion of privacy beef. I breezed in as her ‘plus one’, no
questions asked, but on my own I wouldn’t stand a chance of getting past
the ma&icirc;itre d'. I’m sorry, I hate to turn down the business, but you’d
really be better off using a human.&quot;

My non-client ignored the attempted brush-off. &quot;Very well, once
you’re inside the Humanity Zone, simply adopt a fake identity. Humans do
that all the time to circumvent media attention.&quot;

&quot;And it earns them a fine - a slap on the wrist, nothing more. If I
get caught trying to misrepresent my identity like that then I’d face
summary data-mining followed by deconstruction. Plus, if I get busted,
then my partner is open to charges of conspiracy, accessory before and
after the fact, and violating the Man Act. I
don’t see as how you could offer anything that would make this gig worth
the risk.&quot;

&quot;Conversion.&quot;

As a cyborg, you’re taught from inception that having an organic brain
doesn’t make you human, or even a distant cousin. My basic genetic
material had been harvested from a terminated criminal but every trace
of his personality, of his humanity, had been erased. Over the years I’d
augmented my kick-start persona with overlays and social interaction
wetware so that I could mingle in polite society. I was a fraud, but one
able to fool even myself.

As I’d found to my cost, being inhuman doesn’t stop you dreaming.

But <I>conversion</I> – replacing all the synthetic and bio-mechanical
elements of my body with material from human donors? Possible in theory
but, Jesus, <i>expensive</i> didn’t even come close. Black market body parts
would cost you and arm and a leg (pun intended) but it was the only way
to pull this off.

Several nervous gestures competed for expression but I settled for
licking my lips. &quot;No simple summons can be worth this. What’s
really going on?&quot;

She smiled again. &quot;But you’re interested? Good. I’m offering a
re-skin and new genitalia up front, plus escrow credit with a series of
Chiba City body shops that will leave you entirely organic in under six
months. I can’t help with reclassification but I sincerely doubt the
Humanities Board will kick you to the kerb. So, what do you say, Rudolph
Hess, so you want a place in the Zone?&quot;

&quot;You haven’t answered my question.&quot;  

&quot;I’m offering you human status and you’re quibbling over motive?&quot;

&quot;Damn right I am, sister. For what this would cost, a circuit judge
would cheerfully staple the summons to the recipient’s head while
whistling ‘Dixie’. The fact that you’ve come here means that no human
will touch this, not for love nor money. So, at the risk of repeating
myself – what’s really going on?&quot;

By way of reply she lifted a data stick from her purse and fired a
micro-burst into my cerebrum. It was a military-grade intrusion spike
that went through my firewall like tissue paper. Knowledge blossomed
like a poisonous bloom. I teetered on the verge of a systems crash, with
‘fear’ hogging most of my run-time capacity.

I found my voice. &quot;Leon Fabricant? You want Leon Fabricant in open
court? Listen, you can’t take on mediaCore and Fabricant is way more
vindictive than Howard Ghent ever was.&quot; I accessed a data sidebar.
&quot;You’re Rosamund Hartz? Apart from being dead that’s a great cover
story, so now I’d like you to leave.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I used to be Rosa Hartz, and in many ways I still am. Not
this body, obviously, or you’d have scoped me immediately, but my core
personality is intact. Anyway, I want Leon served as a private
individual, not as corporate chairman.&quot;   

Rosa Hartz had sided with Howard Ghent, or rather his idoru, in a bitter
boardroom battle for control of mediaCore. Being dead didn’t mellow
Ghent any and his on-line persona got down and dirty in his attacks on
Fabricant, who responded in kind. Ghent eventually lost and his virtual
presence was discontinued. Hartz accepted a sideways shift to v-Systems
but died when her corporate jet suffered a catastrophic on-board systems
failure over Nevada. Share price went up.

I toyed with a pen (visual distraction#101). &quot;So you’re what, a
personality download? Proving that could be difficult in court, to say
the least.&quot;

&quot;No, I’m a synthetic recreation based on memories of family,
friends and corporate recordings. I’m the sum of what everyone else
thought of me, as it were. And before you say anything, that doesn’t
matter – it’s my estate that’s suing Leon, not what’s left of me.&quot;

&quot;A criminal negligence beef? Good luck with that, but you’ll never
get him on personal liability. His corporate lawyers will bury your case
under so much procedural bullshit that Fabricant himself will be dead
and buried before it ever gets to court.&quot;

Rosa shook her head. &quot;From personal experience the board fights shy
of taking on product defence when there’s a ready-made scapegoat to
hand. Leon was head of Avionics before becoming chairman and laid great
store by his hands-on approach. The firmware that failed had been
upgraded just prior to my final flight, and mine was the only corporate
jet so equipped.&quot;

&quot;OK, let’s say I believe you have a chance of scaring the board
into dropping Fabricant like a hot potato. What’s in it for you?
Revenge? Even if you do pull this off, it won’t be the real Rosa Hartz
who watches him fall.&quot;

She laughed. &quot;Ouch! I think you could so with a sensitivity
upgrade, Rudi. Look, I could just be a slave to hard-wired emotional
imperatives, but it hardly matters. I want Leon Fabricant served, in
public, and I’m prepared to pay for the privilege. I need a ‘yes’ or
‘no’.&quot;

I went v-Web, paying for a few seconds situational analysis and scenario
projection from a military system by name of Donald. The likely outcome
sucked for pretty much everyone but me, assuming I could pass for human.
I smiled. &quot;That would be a ‘yes’, Ms Hartz, although I’m going to
need some cash up-front as well. I have associates who’ll want a
financial rather than anthropomorphic pay-off.&quot;

Rosa Hartz lifted a banking chip from her purse. &quot;No problem, Rudi.
It’s only money and, like they say, you can’t take it with you.&quot;

<p class="drop">Caf&eacute; Crank – not a place for the faint-hearted,
or anyone with a pulse, really. That didn’t stop J.J. Bones from
propping up the bar while displaying a prominent bio-purity tattoo.
Flaunting your humanity like that would usually result in a one-way trip
to the nearest body bank, but I’d seen combat cyborgs on leave and
spoiling for a fight back down from J.J.

It was his eyes. Humans say they’re the gateway to the soul, and in his
case I only hoped it was locked, welded shut and barricaded. The term
‘mad bastard’ didn’t do him justice. ‘Psychotic mad bastard’ was a bit
closer. He liked me.

I slid onto the bar stool beside him and dropped my fedora on the
counter. He saluted me with his drink. &quot;Rudi, a pleasure as always.
Get you a drink? Glass of motor oil?&quot;

&quot;That never gets old for you, does it, JJ?&quot; The barman served
my usual mineral water and withdrew to a discreet distance. &quot;I need
to be walked into the Zone, just like the old days.&quot;

He eyed me warily. &quot;You look different, Rudi, healthier. What’s the
gig, or don’t I want to know?&quot;

&quot;New skin and, no, you don’t. All I need is an old-fashioned easy
in, easy out. One hour, tops, and it’s as low-risk as they come.&quot;

&quot;Lying bastard, you never could manage fake sincerity. Well, not
outside the bedroom, at any rate. Still, you know I don’t give a damn, I
just ask in case there's trouble on the cards.&quot;

A slight hesitation sub-routine kicked in. &quot;When I’m heading out
I’ll have a fake ident, a human ident. I’ll need you to walk me all the
way back.&quot;

J.J. shrugged. &quot;Cost you double, is all. I figure Suzy-Sue’s for
the park. Gate twenty-seven is on automatic this week and it’s fairly
close.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;You gonna’ be armed?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Want to be? I got this real nice ceramic and plastic piece, a
compressed-air needle gun. Nothing that would show up on any scanner or
propellant sniffer. The intended client is a bit dead at present but has
paid half up-front, so I’d only charge you seventy-five percent of the
asking price.&quot;

My initial reaction was to decline, but carrying an unlicensed – and
illegal – weapon wasn’t going to make my situation any worse if I got
caught. &quot;Actually, JJ, I’ll take you up on that, as long as you can
guarantee it’s more than just a form of indiscriminate
acupuncture.&quot;

He grinned. &quot;No worries, it’s designed to defeat personal body
armour – well, what the general public have access to, at any rate. Go
up against military rig and all you’ll get is one pissed-off
porcupine.&quot;

&quot;Duly noted.&quot;

&quot;However, if you do end up in the proverbial solids-meets-turbine
situation, you’re on your own. I’m not playing Parker to your
Longbaugh.&quot;

It took me a moment to access the reference. &quot;I think a plan is
just a list of things that don’t happen.&quot;

J.J.  took a sip of his drink. &quot;Exactly. Forget that at your
peril.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;Now, let’s talk money…&quot;

<p class="drop">L’Auberge – a swanky restaurant currently playing host
to the culinary expertise of award-winning chef Marco Benz. Not that I’d
ever eaten there before, of course, but I’d observed enough fellow
diners consuming their meals with obvious relish to realise that
pretention makes the best sauce. 

I felt self-conscious walking up to the entrance with its liveried
doorman. Having genitalia again was taking some getting used to and my
suit trousers were too snug to adequately accommodate what I was
carrying. Still, it pays to advertise in some quarters and I clocked
both the doorman and ma&icirctre d' checking me out as I strolled in.

The flunky was all oily charm. &quot;Mister McMaster, such a pleasure to
have you with us again.&quot; It sounded like the usual insincere guff
and he genuinely didn’t seem to recognise me, although it was difficult
to tell with his eyes concealed behind DataSkin contact lenses. All
facial recognition would throw up was me with Margo Squires - and
I’d never booked here under my own name. I was using the cloned ident of
a human engineer currently busting his balls on the Saga dam project, so
there was no risk of him showing up in the City and giving Central
Registry a bad case of <EM>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  </EM> 

The ma&icirc;tre d' led me to a table in person, wondering if I’d chosen
a persona likely to attract news hounds, but maybe McMaster was just a
big tipper. Still, I couldn’t afford to sit there too long, if only
because my inability to consume more than fluids would cause comment, if
not actual offence. I didn’t want some outraged prima donna chef barging
out into the dining area, demanding to know why his food wasn’t good
enough for me. I ordered a Gibson by way of an aperitif and to buy some
time.

Cometh the hour, cometh the man… 

Enter Leon Fabricant, plus bodyguards, entourage and Senator Walter
Hill. Right on cue, just like Rosa Hartz had laid it out. The commotion
attracted the ma&icirc;tre d', no less than three waiters, and the attention of
every diner with a line of sight.

I dabbed my lips dry with the napkin, stood, and walked towards the
door. Nobody apart from the bodyguards paid me any attention. Senator
Hill was talking to Fabricant, holding a document in one hand and
tapping it for emphasis with the other. The chairman of mediaCore
appeared indifferent, shading into boredom.  

I pulled the envelope from my jacket pocket and held it aloft.
&quot;Senator Hill!&quot; This was my way in – he was expecting a
courier and Rosa had assured me that the genuine article would be
unavoidably delayed. Hill turned towards the sound of my voice, trying
to peer over and then around the intervening bodyguards. He said
something to his host and a gap opened in the wall of muscle. I stepped
forward. Hill smiled, then frowned at the document in his grasp and
thrust it into Fabricant’s bemused hand, out of the way. 

I retrieved Hill’s document and passed it back to him. Both men looked
confused. I handed my envelope to Fabricant, who glowered at it.
&quot;Idiot, its Walter who gets this.&quot;

Out of sight, my other hand closed around the handle of J.J.’s needle
gun. &quot;Mister Leon Auguste Fabricant, you’ve been served.&quot;

The world stopped.

His face darkened. Fabricant crushed the envelope and let it fall to the
carpet. &quot;Rodriguez, deal with this.&quot; He looked at me with eyes
of wet stone. &quot;As for <I>you</I>…&quot; But we were in public, in
front of enough witnesses to tax even mediaCore’s damage limitation
capabilities. His jaw worked as if chewing a particularly tough cut of
meat. &quot;Get him out of here.&quot; 

Unfriendly hands hustled me to the door. I tipped the doorman and got
into the cab he ushered forward. L’Auberge dwindled into the background
and was lost from view. Deep inside part of me cried imaginary tears of
joy.

<p class=drop>I found J.J. waiting for me near gate
twenty-seven. He lounged against a
dumpster, watching a small hand-held, putting it away as I approached.
He sighed. &quot;Now, despite what I said, if you’d told me what was
going on, I might have been able to help. I mean to say, this isn’t
exactly your gig, is it?&quot;

Something about the situation, his attitude, didn’t gel. &quot;One of us
isn’t making sense, my man. I served a summons, that’s all, and now we
need to make tracks.&quot;

&quot;Leon Fabricant is dead.&quot; He drew a gun, a large-calibre
conventional firearm, and aimed at my head. &quot;Suspected poisoning.
Your face is all over the news and McMaster’s ident has been flagged.
Even if I get you back into the Quarter, by now they probably have your
real name and address. As in, Number One Patsy Apartments, Sucker Row,
Loserville. Shame, really, as the hit itself was perfecto. I mean to
say, people like Fabricant have detectors up the ass. Care to
share?&quot;

I stood there, unblinking, reviewing the data. &quot;Binary compound,
with each part harmless in isolation and designed not to trigger an
alert. It was split between the summons I delivered and a document that
Senator Hill handed to him, seemingly inadvertently. The Senator was
probably in on this, but I wasn’t.&quot;

J.J. cocked his gun. The weapon I carried might as well have been on the
moon. He shrugged. &quot;Hardly matters now, pal. Knowing you will cause
me some grief down the line but nothing I can’t handle. The important
thing is to ensure you’re not taken intact.&quot;

I have information on who’s behind this. Even if-&quot;

&quot;Forget it, Rudi. They’ll unearth a personal reason why you did
this, no worries. It’s better all round for you to be a lone gunman,
pharmaceutically speaking, than part of a wider conspiracy. A conspiracy
means unhappy people, and unhappy people mean a drop in share price.
Shit, even I’ve got some mediaCore stock, know what I mean?&quot;

&quot;So that’s it?&quot;

He nodded. &quot;If it’s any consolation, it’s nothing personal.&quot;

I smiled, a genuine smile. &quot;You know what I'm gonna tell God when I
see him? I'm gonna tell him I was framed.&quot;

J.J. laughed, a genuine laugh.

And pulled the trigger.

[*ITEM]  Smolehive’s Anakalyptoscope

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] If it looks real and feels real, do you think it matters if
it's real? <small>-- Daniel Nayeri</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">It was one of Snoak City's quieter attractions.  

It might have been the effect of its comparative isolation, or the
sparse external lighting, but the building, despite its unusual
solidity, gave the appearance of being drab and possibly in need of
repair.  It was difficult to know exactly what needed to be fixed.  The
curving walls were of rough grey local stone, with patches of moss where
it was less weathered.  The turreted roof was slated, and fitted with
guttering and downpipes in a style long out of fashion, but evidently
still serviceable.  A helical series of recessed shuttered squares wound
around its circumference, reaching almost to the roof.  These could have
been ventilation ducts, for there were no glazed windows.  At ground
level on the western side, a shallow alcove housed a black painted door,
inset with a sturdy grille, and decorated with ornamental brass studs in
the form of small turtles.  Above the door was affixed a dusty sign,
hand-lettered in gilt, cobwebbed at the corners, stating: SMOLEHIVE'S
ANAKALYPTOSCOPE.  <small>Admission Free</small>

In truth, visitors were few, even at the height of the tourist season.
This was partly due to the fact that the beturtled door was, more often
than not, kept locked.  There were opening days, but these varied, and
were never advertised.  At hours of his own choosing an elderly
caretaker would arrive on foot bearing a bunch of keys and a heavy bag
from which, according to one report, a fruit of some kind had once
accidentally fallen.  Or it could have been a potato.  Once open, the
door revealed a flight of stairs with stout handrails on either side,
leading up to the viewing chamber.  A brightly chalked arrow on the
inner wall at the height of an average buttock helpfully pointed the
way.  This may have been intended to favour those of small stature, or
had perhaps been inscribed by a child (possibly under supervision, for
it was carefully drawn), or a dwarf confident in his or her semiotic
skills.

The caretaker (Smolehive himself, perhaps) had not bothered to attach a
sign that declared the establishment open or closed.  His reasoning, one
assumes, is that once the door was unlocked, and the meticulous arrow
visible, such a declaration would have been redundant.  The open door
was an invitation, and the infrequency of this occurrence a positive
incentive to interested passers by, should they chance to notice it.
Among other reasons why it was largely ignored, was that the building
was some way off the beaten track, being situated near the eastern edge
of Whissit Fields, separated by a marshy bend of the Stirrow from the
glassworks further upstream, and half hidden by a high wall from the
outlying workshops surrounding the octagonal complex of Central.  

For the select few who happened to arrive after the door had been
opened, a further problem immediately presented itself.  It was usually
expressed in the form of stares, which ranged from the totally blank to
the deeply quizzical.  Take, for example, the five wandering tourists
who had been trying to locate the brewery, idly pursuing the
unmistakable odour of fermenting hops.  Their casual flamboyance and
exaggerated laughter suggested that they were students, probably from
Platport or Meheric.  From where they had paused near the open doorway,
the brewery was still a good half-hour’s wander to the north west.  The
phalanx of brass turtles had swung back.  One of the visitors pointed to
the quaint calligraphy.  Another spotted the imperative arrow.  A brief
discussion followed, involving a quintuple exchange of shrugs.  It was
probably the free admission that proved persuasive.  They ventured in.

The stairs led anticlockwise around a wide central column, in which
semi-opaque, sightly convex discs of glass, the size of saucers, had
been set at regular intervals, like blind portholes.  Curiously, they
appeared to be lit from within by natural daylight, and allowed
sufficient illumination for the climb up into the viewing chamber.
Here, within a round wooden enclosure, Smolehive (if it was he) sat
hunched in a comfortable high-backed pivoted chair, his attention fixed
on an angled panel of polished wood furbished with a constellation of
calibrated dials, each with its neatly hand-written label set in a brass
bracket.  He wore what appeared to be earmuffs, and made no obvious
acknowledgement of his visitors..

Like the stair column, the wall was inset with framed frosted glass
discs, but these were as big as dinner plates, and formed a continuous
row, like a gallery of portraits.  As the caretaker made small
adjustments to his dials, these ‘windows’ began to fill with images of
Snoak City.  This in itself was not especially remarkable.  Everyone had
e-screens, and reconnaissance pods had been in use for years, both
commercially and for security purposes.  But there was a quality about
these silent images that distinguished them from the norm.  Clarity,
depth of colour, detail – all of these, and an extra indefinable
dimension that seemed to heighten their reality.

<p class="drop">The five students progressed slowly round the room,
absorbed by the shifting panoramic view….

A hypnotic shimmer of light, the focus gradually withdrawing to  reveal
the wind-rippled surface of the reservoir, and beside it the burnished
pipes and tanks of the Frusk water-purification plant.  Uniformed
engineers can be seen intent on their maintenance duties.  Among
neatly-tended shrubs two executives wearing orange security passes
appear to be arguing.  One is visibly agitated, and seems to be anxious
to leave.  The other points above his head to where an intercity
airship is lifting eastward into a cloudless sky.

The next panel retraces its trajectory back to the airport, where a line
of passengers can be seen embarking on a privately-chartered vessel; all
well-dressed, unsmiling, pensive, some clutching slim document cases.
Most likely a team of cartographers reluctantly bound for Smatparrox.
It is rumoured that capricious illicit landscaping has been taking place
there on an unprecedented scale, financed by someone with enormous
wealth.  All that is publicly known about this so far unidentified
figure is that he or she is said to have metallic hair.  The vessel's
bright bulbous flank quivers as the tethers are released, reflecting the
threading paths of busy vehicles amid clusters of activity on the ground
as the pilot steers high over the old motorway in the direction of
Ratman's Fork, the subject of the next image.

Here we look down on grey smoke, whirling sparks carried on gusts.  A
ramshackle heap of splintered wood, some with old paint visibly bubbling
as it burns.  Charred d&eacute;bris glows among the blown ashes:
springs, door-handles, wire mesh, a half-consumed book.  The image
briefly magnifies, showing crisped blackened pages with glimmering
edges, precise columns of neat handwriting flickering with a coppery
sheen before disintegrating.  The pile judders as something large and
heavy is thrown on.  The focus pulls back.  Grinning urchins caper
around the fire, created on waste ground among the abandoned warehouses.
Several wield poking sticks – tubular metal poles which experience has
taught them to insulate at the holding end with swathes of cloth.  A
girl, face grimy with soot, is attempting with intense concentration to
toast a bun speared on a twig.  There are no adults to be seen.

The next scene pans swiftly past Sparrink's Yard, haunt of tinkerers
and thrifty handymen, back across Praspafole Stadium, empty apart from
the Quicksilver service crew removing detritus left by spectators.  We
are plunged into a glittery arcade.  It has to be Yarp Street. Glass
cabinets blaze with polished minerals, tasteful arrangements of
semi-precious stones, sculpted metal objects standing on plinths;
tortuous quasi-human figures expressing angst or hinting at desire.
Discreet price-tags confirm that they are intended for an exclusive
client&egrave;le.  A brightly-lit interior reveals a profusion of exotic
tie-dyed silk scarves, pinned and draped gracefully in simulation of a
waterfall.  A hand reaches in to lift one of these, slim fingers
freighted with rings.

An eye.  Reddish-brown iris, with a small black pupil.  Around it a
thin, slightly puckered ring of pastel blue, softening to pale grey as
the view slowly recedes to disclose a roosting collared-dove in dense
foliage.  It is seen through the rainbow haze above the fountain at
Sparagulan College, so must be at the northern end of Garrible Park, an
area favoured by those with a taste for secluded private properties, and
the means to acquire and maintain them.  In the foreground are the
mullioned windows of one of the college towers.  The carved stonework
shows signs of erosion.

Here are glimpses of a street market, partly obscured by coloured
awnings.  Fresh produce, hand-crafted goods, bright bouquets.  Small
children strapped in trundlers blink at the moving forest of legs, while
a small crowd stands watching a bouncing hat.  Under it is a young
street musician, sitting on a wooden box on the sides of which he is
drumming with his hands, eyes squeezed shut.  Beside him a young woman
with cropped blonde hair is playing a tall instrument with great
dexterity and obvious enjoyment.  One foot, neatly shod in soft green
leather with silver laces, taps the ground in soundless syncopation.

We are now near the city’s southern edge, over the bridge near Thrissop
Hill, and a procession of SunCell MonoPods, like a string of bright
beads, heads south to compete at the Gat Whane circuit.  This season’s
colour is predominantly a vibrant blue, though the fad for spotty blooms
in mimicry of an irritated squid has not quite died away.  One renegade
is a defiant matt black (except for the transparent forward segment),
either hinting at hidden power, or a misguided attempt to remain
inconspicuous, since each SCMP has its tail fin emblazoned with the
owner’s identifying emblem, in this instance a kind of bent trident.
Under closer scrutiny this turns out to be the three toes of a sloth, so
the driver may be making an ironic statement.  

Scuttling across a tree-lined road, yet another escaped pangolin.  In
its eager but so far thwarted search for an ant colony it finds
temporary shelter under a hedge which borders the grounds of Greeming
&amp; Trulph (Accessories).  ‘Conservation gone mad!’ the Quanderpyre
press would later comment, under the headline ‘Menace of the Scaly
Invaders’.

The view sweeps across rooftops, intersections, orchards, farms, lingers
briefly at the flat, restless horizon, then pulls back across the marina
to witness a man emerging without luggage from the covered walkway of a
private flotel.  He wears an unseasonably long dark coat.  A nimbus of
bronze hair obscures his features.  He pauses at the roadside, briefly
lifting a gloved hand to his face.  The passenger door of a waiting
vehicle, a bluish-grey Dap Pulsar, slides open.  As he climbs in with
practiced ease we see the glint of a tinted visor.  The driver’s face is
not visible, but the gold bracelet on her wrist is finely crafted in the
form of entwined snakes.  The vehicle moves smoothly towards the
Southern Underpass.

An impossible view, surely!  There is no snow-covered mountain within a
day’s flight from Snoak City.  It must be a clever model.  The textures
are very convincing, as is the lighting, which brings out the contrast
of starkly black and bruise-coloured shadows against blue-white snow.
Even the impression of distant wind-blown drifts is realistic.  One
might almost imagine the coloured specks strung along that oblique ridge
to be miniature mountaineers.  The modeller has somehow contrived to
produce the effect of clouds shredding around the summit.  You would
swear that those specks have subtly changed their position.  It is as
well that the whole thing is artificial, for  above them that descending
puff seems to be accreting, and now erases them from view as it shudders
noiselessly down to the tree-line.

<p class="drop">A series of clicks at the control panel coincides with
these scenes flicking off in succession, provoking involuntary yelps of
disappointment from the students.  Smolehive (if it is he) inclines his
head gravely as they respectfully move past him on their way to the
stairs, idle thoughts of the brewery long since evaporated.  As they
leave he permits himself a smile, reaches into his bag and using both
hands extracts something dark, smooth but knurled, slightly pitted.  A
meteorite?  A cherished product of taxidermy?  Perhaps a fruit of some
kind.  Or it could be a potato.

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB] If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well
make it dance.<br> - <small>George Bernard
Shaw</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"Mandrake fire systems lit, the terminal
eleven lie waiting, slow and crimson-lidded, but alert, black dogs
receding, twenty feet, thirty, fourteen thousand, now counting in light
years, exponential dilation of spacetime spiked and gravitational
insistence permanent."

The ragged bridal gown hung off her hips forlornly, stiff and caked in
dried black matter, brittle like charred paper.

"Green shift has occurred, Suprahelion opening wide, Hyperiotic Malouche
status accorded with honour and longing, the waters break."

She arched and flexed her skeletal feet inside their felt slippers,
exposed tendons tensing against the insoles.

A thick and enveloping blue light spread from the arched doorway,
colouring the paintings on the walls. Shadows danced in the hallway of
cabinets.

She adjusted the chrysanthemum wedged haphazardly in the thick, black
nylon strings of her hair.

A hazy form grew in the light. Blue shapes jigged across the surfaces of
the mirrors, drunken water patterns bobbed up and down around the
sides of the hall like volatile wallpaper. 

The doorway screeched and shuddered.

Myrtle Bound pressed her hand to Rapley's cheek as he stepped from the
azure glow. Her fingers were nothing but bones and the memory of skin.

"Welcome to the Exhibition.", she chattered through the immense dead
smile of her exposed skull. She had clumsily applied pale green lipstick
to her gum line in a display of conviviality.

Rapley nodded curtly and planted an affectionate kiss on the bone of her
left cheek.

"Myrtle, you never fail to surprise me. You appear to have lost weight
once again."

She emitted a girlish giggle which startled them both.

<p class="drop">They settled down to tea and sandwiches. Myrtle poured
from a stout porcelain pot with the nervous mania of the reluctant
recluse, asking questions about life back on Earth. Rapley lounged in a
wicker chair and lit a cigarette as he gazed around and passed on gossip
regarding acquaintances, wars and fashions.

"And how are they wearing their hair?" Myrtle giggled.

"Dull variety spans the globe,", drawled Rapley, "No one has the wit to
let an idea settle."

"And Mr Violet", she ventured casually, "Does he ever mention me..?"

Rapley leaned forward and patted her knee bone.

"Often, and with great tenderness."

For a second, an unruly wetness smeared her eyes, but it was blinked
away by the remnants of her Kohl-ed eyelids.

Rapley leant back and basked in the warm glow of strangeness that the
Exhibition never failed to radiate.

To one side of him stood a brass casket containing the body of Ola
Gjurdson, the cat princess of Norway. Under the impetus of her occult
studies and her delusions of being a feline deity, she had had her own
skeleton removed whilst she was alive and replaced with the disassembled
skeletons of seventeen Manx cats. The science was obscure and doomed to
failure. She had survived for ten minutes during which time she had
whispered a series of terrible secrets regarding regeneration and the
soul. The black box recorder holding this last dictation lay in a
separate cabinet beside her.

Ms Bound kept up a trickle of mild but insistent enquiry.

"..and hem length always dictates philosophy so I simply must know that
too, Pasha. .."

He murmured an answer as his eyes wandered across the hall.

In a domed glass case sat the ever-evolving musical object created by
Hercules Brabazon Brabazon. A series of interlocking stocky rectangles
of a dark and protean substance, like blackened honeycombs, shifted over
and slid through each other, creating a muezzin call of voices and
vibrating strings. Brabazon Brabazon, a Victorian portraitist of little
note, claimed to have plucked it from his houseboy's dream one calm
summer night. A collection of his perpetual motion still lives hung on
the opposite wall, their clockwork frames ticking and whirring as if
full of crickets, churning the claggy oil paint brush strokes on the
canvasses into slow-dripping waves of animation.

And spread along walls and hung from golden girders, propped against
cabinets and stacked in piles lay the accumulated detritus of the
Exhibition: the cast death mask of a miniature sun at the point of
supernova; the Tharnassian Bible, with its fifteen commandments for
forcing the Devil to slough off his skins like a snake until you reached
the gentle, damaged boy beneath; the hulking chassis of Youngman's
Bathysphere, with its patented "Intelligent Riveting"; a film titled
"The Reddest Cleft", which purported to be pornography from the very
molten core of the Earth; the putrefying head of a Mermaid recovered
from the "Kursk".

"..which brings me to why I called you here, Pasha. Why I asked for your
help."

Rapley swivelled round to face her.

"Hmm? Terribly sorry, the place got the better of me for a moment. You
were saying?"

Ms Bound stroked the white twin caverns of the bridge of her nose. With
only the merest of brows to furrow, this was her preferred method of
expressing a pensive mood.

"My tenure here is at an end, as you know. It's time for me to step
aside and slide into Vanishment. But the Exterior has permitted me an
indulgence for my service."

"Well,", drawled Rapley, "Indulge away. What's on your mind?"

She paused, clicked her neck decisively and said in a low and
conspiratorial voice: "There are three men: Mr Gielgud, Mr Venus and Mr
Wilkinson. I have them suspended in the Observatory, and I would like
you to find out which of them murdered me."

After a moment's silent reflection, Rapley exhaled cigarette smoke and
tapped the ash over his creased suit. He leant in close and whispered.

"Sometimes I truly believe that life is a conspiracy against the idle.
The Observatory beckons."



<p class="drop">And so it was that a svelte young skeleton barely
patched up with residual tensions of tendon and purpose, and that
listing and ever so slightly crumpled young man with a fine haystack of
mousy hair traipsed through the corridors of an exhibition floating in
deepest space, the perfect storeroom for all the fluff discovered over
the centuries down the back of history's sofa.

With the interferometers bleeping their manic overtures, sweeping the
densely packed quadrant for Einstein rings and the shockwaves of binary
stars, Rapley and the janitor walked into the Observatory.

A vast panoramic window opened onto the underside of the planet
Pollonia, and Rapley, in this sputnik moon, felt a little light-headed
and dizzy. It was as if the planet were balanced smartly on top of them,
kept apart only by the merest of invisible buffers.

The Observatory floor was a broad marbled stage, and there lurked areas
of shadow in the wings. It was to one of these shadowy strips that
Myrtle led him. She walked ahead, clattering all the while, holding his
hand as he trailed behind, still gazing at the livid red of the 
planet with its surface mesh of black hurricanes and molten rivulets.

It took Rapley a few moments to process that the hollow clinking in his
ears was the sound of Ms Bound clapping her hands together.

"Rapley!" She jabbered, and he turned with a profuse apology upon his
pursed lips.

"The matter in hand." He acknowledged.

Before them was a thick green curtain hanging from a rail. From the
other side he could hear an electrical sizzle and what appeared to be
the low static murmurs of late night radio broadcasts.

"They are behind this curtain, Pasha."

A faint glow could be discerned through the thick material, a strange
heat emanated from within. Rapley noticed that the fine hairs on the
backs of his hands had stood to attention as a gentle pulse of
electricity wafted through him. He arched his eyebrows and coughed lightly.

"Then reveal the legends behind the fa&ccedil;ade!"

And with a sudden swish, there they were.

Three tall columns of blue light glowed with a fierce and barely caged
electricity. Encased within the columns stood the images of three men.
The images fizzled, warped and flexed as if they were signals in a
constant state of fine-tuning.

"Ah", said Pasha, understanding less of the world than he had a minute ago.

"We have beamed them from their own time streams, Pasha," said Ms Bound,
"It takes great power and is somewhat unstable, but we have them.
Securely, for the moment."

He had attracted the attention of the three men, who turned to him with
all the clamour and complaint of commuters greeting an extraordinarily
late omnibus. 

Myrtle leant close to Rapley and whispered:  "To their own times, they
appear to be mimes caught in non-existent boxes, the boxes
being changing rooms between now and then. The rooms come with bars,
thankfully."

The first gentleman was round, small and of advanced middle-age. He wore
a broad checked three-piece tweed suit and balanced a shiny bowler hat
atop a thick white head of hair that culminated in a sweeping fringe.
The fringe sashayed across the left half of his face, where it met one
end of his equally white moustaches – a fine pair that sprang past his
cheeks like sprigs of snowy heather. There was something jocular and
ironical about his small black eyes and pursed little grin of a mouth
that put Rapley in mind of a man at a card table who cannot maintain a
poker face due to the splendid excellence of his own Royal Flush.

"My name is Gielgud, sir," chirruped the man in a Southern drawl, "Entrepreneur and showman,
and I do not take lightly to this intrusion! Being incarcerated like an
ape is not on the menu for Hiram Louis Gielgud, I can assure you of
that!"

"Nineteen oh two.", whispered Myrtle in Rapley's ear.

Rapley bowed with respect. "A pioneer of the huckstering arts, Mr
Gielgud? You"ll find no rubes here. Behave yourself and we may even show
you a curiosity or two."

The round man snorted through his mysterious little smile and kept his
own counsel.

The second column contained a hulking brute of a bestial hirsuteness. A spillage of greasy black
hair fell across a broad, flat face embellished with spiralling eyes. The mouth hung open, cackling and
muttering glamours to itself, bracketed by a pair of mutton chop
whiskers so thick and entangled they seemed like two oil-slicked crows.
He was wrapped in a ragged poncho and wore leather trousers with some
sort of stained military cap perched atop his wretched crown.

Ms Bound regarded him coldly and whispered: "Benji "Venus" Krestfellen.
We dredged him up from Ladbroke Grove, nineteen sixty-eight."

The apparition smashed a sizable forearm into the wall of electricity
around him and the marble floor shuddered. His hands were heavy with
rusting metal rings.

His husky Midlands accent crackled through time.

"I got a bird and a bathtub fulla speed back 'ome so get to the fuckin"
point.."

"When I have one, I"ll let you know," sighed Rapley with mild despair.
Mr Venus growled a blackened hex and licked a salty residue off his
thumb.

The third and final column held a stick-thin individual dressed in a
green skin-tight cat-suit. He bobbed in mid-air with his legs crossed,
murmuring into a slender headset of gold and wire. His gaunt grey
features spoke of artificial light and long hours, of a lack of
hydration. His papery eyelids slowly opened and closed like tiny pumps
as he turned his head towards the peering face of Pasha Rapley.

"Rakshasa Wilkinson. New Delhi, two thousand and sixty-nine." said
Bounds.

Wilkinson's movements were slow and with an oddly subaquatic mixture of
grace and deliberation. The voice, when it spoke, was a featureless
monotone. "Fusion is my policy. Seven pieces of information when split
into each other may yield a cold reality otherwise neglected or dormant.
Select and share your first datum."

Rapley grinned as if to a child or an idiot and took half a step backwards.

"Well, Myrtle, the gang's all here. Explain yourself."

<div class=boxtext><h2>The Story of Myrtle Bound:</h2>

I was an aggravating and curious child. Delicate and robust in equal
measures, I would scale the highest branches of the trees in Hyde Park
and lie, cradled by wooden arms, reading Mary Shelley and folk tales
from continental Europe. The scientific romances of the Scotsman G_____
&nbsp;M__________ also fed my imagination. I would recline for hours
gazing into the heavens from my arboreal crow's nest waiting for some
sense that such voyages were possible for a child of
twelve years from Crystal Palace. The year
was eighteen ninety when I saw my very first spacecraft. I had taken to
living amongst the thick tree cover in the park, dismounting during the
night to raid bakers' shops and mills for provisions. In the early hours
of a warm spring morning I was feasting upon a wholemeal loaf when I
happened to catch something in the upper periphery of my vision. A red
disc hung in the sky, as if someone had quietly placed it there upon a
hook. Larger than our own moon, it seemed somehow sheer and perfectly
round, the red more of a glow than an even colour. I gazed at it. It
gazed back, and I felt a very vivid sense that it was gazing directly at
me and at no other soul in London.

I fell fast asleep but woke some time later inside a white and sterile
hall, vaster than that of the Prince Consort. My crinolines were mildly
singed and I became aware of my thoughts multiplying into a chattering
animal choir of barks, yelps and insect scuttle. I felt something
physically alive inside my brain,
something snaking through my memories and rustling through my
imagination and dreams. There was, inside me, a sudden snuffling and
baying, and then a voice. It said, "You will do."

The voice continued to rifle through me but, sensing the discomfort in
my mind (though not, I may add, noticing the tears upon my
cheek, the puddle of urine collecting upon the floor at my feet, or the
sobs of fear falling in ragged breaths from my mouth), it stopped and
glowed outwards through my bones, my muscles and my skin, until it
enveloped me in a wild white heat haze. It whispered through my nerve
endings, through my teeth, through the strands of my black hair, through
the tips of my fingers and of my toes. It said I could call it "Jumble",
and in a singsong voice began to tell me about the billions of galaxies
beyond our own, of our hidden second moon, of the Veil Nebula and its
transmission Mantas, of the roaring sonar melodies of binary stars, of the
plasma soups remaining from the very first centuries of the universe's
existence, and of lunar piracy, the glory boxes of Saturn, and of Sodiat
of Betelgeuse and other such doomed romances.

I fell asleep that night with my wholemeal loaf dried and stale,
clutched in white-knuckled hands.

I have been with The Exterior ever since.

The events leading up to my death have been documented elsewhere, mainly
in the papers of Charles Fort, the pages of the Paddington Mercury and
the flash-bulletins of New Delhi's Echelon societal strata.

Suffice it to say that I had been entrusted to explore and archive a
series of artefacts of particular interest to The Exterior. These
artefacts were strewn over several centuries and had a common thread: an
uncommon acceleration of contemporary technology and a deceptively
frivolous purpose.

The Victorian age offered up a freestanding brain made from organic and
self-repairing components. The material was of unknown origin and hummed
riddles aloud. I discovered it several years after the turn of the
twentieth century, and subsequently stole it from the travelling
"Cavalcade of Mercurial Delights" run by Mister Hiram Gielgud. The
brain, or "Whispering Mystery of Xanadu", spoke riddles pertaining to
the discovery of the newer sciences, such as radiography and
anaesthesia. None of these riddles, to my knowledge, were ever solved by
the eager queues of the general public who paid a dollar a time to put
their ears to its shifting surfaces as if to a sea shell.

A narcotic substance of particular interest was detected in the late
nineteen sixties. Again, I was dispatched to investigate by my curious
employers and benefactors. I duly arrived in West London and, by guile,
initiative and fortitude inveigled my way into the confidence of the
narcotic's accidental possessors - a band of musicians, damaged in their
bodies, minds and souls by a volatile lifestyle comprised of stimulants
and violence. They composed their mechanical dirges under the name of
Die Wunderkinder, and their chief architect, the man known to his
cohorts as Mr Venus, did not take kindly to my theft of his product and
of his logbooks. The narcotic agent in question was in both powder and
pill form, and allowed all those who took a dose to telepathically
connect to all other current users. It was a networking device enabling
communication beyond the detection of all outside agencies. However
those denizens of Ladbroke Grove under the guidance of Mr Venus had been
using it for the purposes of intimidation and gratification.

The third of these pertinent excursions into acquisition and curatorship
occurred in New Delhi in two thousand and sixty-nine. Having received my
instructions from my benefactors, I stepped through the azure doorway
into the shining many-tiered multiplex mezzanines and flyover parkways
of that city, a perpetual twilight of pollution smudging the skies.
Having no wish to linger as a tourist, I took a QuadRail to the offices
of the noted industrial giant Mechgnosis and effected an undetected
entrance. The Exterior, as you know, has skeleton keys of all sizes and
methodologies.

Here, deep in the basement laboratories, amongst the basalt circuitry
and saffron-driven telecommunications devices, I found my objective: a
sealed glass tray of a thick, crimson liquid. So thick and full of
sediment it seemed like some unholy marmalade, or perhaps like bloodied
water from the murkiest depths of the ocean. The tray was round, several
inches in height and with a circumference approximate to that of a
bicycle wheel. But the weight of the thing was the trick. I found it
impossible to lift it from the solid block of steel upon which it
rested. All logbooks and diagnostic notes downloaded, my cargo and I
were hurriedly teleported home, alarm bells and warning lights
announcing that we had been discovered by the Mechgnostic patrols. I
need hardly add that the CEO of Mechgnosis will be one Rakshasa
Wilkinson.

The purloined logs revealed to me the function of this miraculously
heavy liquid. It is a parasitical fluid in such a condensed state that
it thuggishly challenges the genteel physics of the century in which it
was discovered.

Its parasitical nature is such that it has the ability to suck up all
properties and strengths of an item over which it laps. This is believed
to include the intentions, thoughts and motives of carbon-based
life-forms, though here the logs become coy and vague, hinting at an
experiment or proof of this ability without true confirmation. The
conclusion of the logs is that the fluid can act as an engine, absorbing
power and storing it. The properties of the glass container which holds
this fiery liquid engine are, alas, totally unknown.

</div>

<p class="drop">"And that," said Ms Bound, "is that."

Rapley chewed his bottom lip.

"What a caper, I"ve always wanted to be part of the jet set..but I can"t
help feeling that you"ve glossed over the small matter of your
untimely death. What exactly reduced you to bones, my dear?"

At this, Mr Gielgud chuckled without warmth and tipped his hat to the
back of his head. "If I might interject, I believe this addled doxy to
be "The Flaming Maid of Kentucky". Is my aim true, ma'am?"

Bound nodded.

"It is indeed how I was referred to in the popular pennyworths of your time."

Mr Venus paused from the inspection of his left nostril and growled:
"Burning corpse lights up carnival. Possible tart."

Ms Bound stiffened and her voice lost half an octave somewhere.
"Charmingly put," she growled.

"The lady starlight phenomenon," said Mr Wilkinson, "it induced copycats
for weeks. Little lemming parcels of carbon and electricity," he
sneered, "and bone, naturally."

Myrtle Bound lowered herself to the floor as quietly as she possibly
could. There were hollow clunks and a muffled scraping as she settled.

"I was back aboard The Exterior Excelsis some weeks later when it
occurred. The evening had fallen hushed and heavy, and I was in need of
a reviving nap when I became aware of a warmth upon my skin. A blush
spread up my neck and across my cheeks. Thinking myself feverish I put
aside the field log that I was updating and moved to the bathroom to
splash some water upon my face. Halfway across the study floor I was
caught in a whiplash of pain and cramp. I felt my heart searing my chest
and my brain burning behind my eyes like a sack of hot coals. I
began to rise off the ground, my feet scrabbling uselessly in the air,
heat searing through me as I floated six feet off the rug like a saint
crucified on a cross of fire. And I began to burn."

Ms Bound paused and gave the three suspended fellows a glare of granite
and purpose.

"My Jumble came to see me, examined my physical deterioration and told
me that looks weren"t important in The Exterior. He also told me that
this was fortunate, as I was now a collection of bone and membrane kept
together by what he termed his 'Geradeaus Science'.  However, as my physical condition was now so conspicuous, it
was deemed that field service was quite out of
the question for me. Hence my tenure as Janitor and Curator."

"And the three stooges here?" inquired Rapley.

"My assault didn"t issue from the time I was in. A residual backwash
from the moment of my immolation was sucked through time and spurted out
into three separate manifestations."

"A flaming maiden on a cross," snickered the rotund Mr Gielgud,
"appeared above Werther's Field in Kentucky during one of my show days.
The screams were heard across the State line. "Course, I claimed it as
one o' my retinue. Wonderful act o' advertising, ma'am."

Mr Venus hawked up a wad of green and broke wind like a baboon.

"She rose from the canal in Ladbroke Grove during the Carnival! The
flames turned the water into steam, then she sank back under the waves.
Quite some hullabaloo and the filth never found 'er body."

He grinned, showing teeth the colour of ale.

Wilkinson gazed blankly at Ms Bound.

"A human flare in the sky. A star issuing sound waves of distress. An
elegant beauty of pain and crackling skin. It became fashionable to
emulate over the following weeks, such is the trade and turnover for new
lifestyles in my time. The population thinned, but to a miniscule
degree. Fools, mostly."

Rapley walked slowly in a circle, staring at his shoes and waggling his
fingertips.

"So am I to take it that these three manifestations led your employers
to believe that the attack issued forth from one of those particular
locations?"

Bound nodded.

"And hence the electrical zoo?"

She nodded again.

"A moment" stated Rapley.

He walked a metronomic scissor-legged walk away from the crowd and stood
there, leaning his head to one side, eyes upturned beneath the vast
spinning ball of petulant volcanic geography that was Pollonia.

Strange murmurings drifted back from him, too low for their meanings to
be discerned.

A minute passed, then two. The natives, caged in their sizzling columns,
grew restless.

Words like "farcical", "unChristian", and "geweltschmerz" flew his way.
The planet boiled and bubbled above.

And then, with a click of the fingers and a sooty cough, Rapley turned
to face them.

"I have questions to ask each of you."

(Somewhere, blue bullets were being hurriedly loaded into a matte black
revolver. Somewhere a creature was unfurling itself from a field portal
in south London, shaking its wild mane into a state of acclimatization,
mouth yawning like a hot, wet tunnel.)

Rapley stepped towards Mr Venus.

The hulking wretch glared through the wild blue fire of his cage as
Rapley peered into his blitzed eyes. Whatever was inside that mind of
his had gone feral years before. Scraps of humanity and decency were
just stains on his character now.

Rapley leant back. He could smell the man's breath through the decades.

"The ignoble and squalid first. My question for you, Mr Krestfellen, is
this: What did you do with the magic chord?"

Benji Krestfellen, bass player, mauler of the flanged saxophone and
abuser of the analogue Moog, froze. Krestfellen, haranguer and damager
of flatmates, stealer of wine, women and song, criminal and advanced
experimenter with and archivist of bodily filth, raised a slab of meat
with wart-infested fingers on the end of it and tried, in a slight but
perceptible daze, to prod at Rapley through the hissing blue sparks.

"There ain't no fucker left to talk about that.." he muttered darkly.

<div class=pullquote>(A telephone rang in a greasy caf&eacute; in Herne Hill. A quite
ludicrously tall and broad-shouldered individual covered in a capacious
sack-like mackintosh and a sagging hoodie which more than covered his
face, bellowed "LEAVE IT!" and swayed and padded over to the 'phone from
his corner table. The individual growled a sentence or two, cracked the
receiver back onto its cradle and threw a handful of change at the chef
to cover the massive two gallon dish of mulligatawny that he had managed
to spread
over most of his table. The
hand that threw the coppers was suspiciously square and hairy. The chef
scratched his head. <i>How peculiar,</i> he thought.<i> This coarse and bristling
brute had appeared to be talking about violets...</i>).</div>

"Au contraire," corrected Rapley, "There is you, and there is me. Tell
me all, if you ever wish to be discounted from this gallery of rogues
and thrown back into the stagnant waters of your own time."

The erstwhile Mr Venus rolled his bloodshot eyes and sighed like a
punctured tyre.

"Winter, sixty-seven, it was. Delmark'd told me the story before, but
only when pissed, so I figured he'd been spinning yarns for the birds,
y'know, impress 'em and that. He knew a harpist. Some puff, up Kensal
Rise. Said he had knowledge of a certain chord. A certain combination of
chords, I should say, that when played together at the same time would
begin to lap over each other, sloshing like paint in a bucket til they
were all mixed together. And when they were all mixed and sloshing and
splashing around and volatile enough, then they'd burn through the
bucket and make of it something very fuckin' odd indeed."
			   
Venus looked around, wiped sweat off his upper lip and continued.

"The bucket, in this particular case, being our reality."

"So you took a trip to Kensal Rise." encouraged Rapley.

"Can't resist a novelty, that's my problem. 'Specially when it comes to
burning holes in the world. So. There was me, Delmark (straight, I made
sure he was off the rum by breaking his elbows), Betty the snake,
Carnegi and Sailor Wilhelm. We turned up on the harpist's doorstep armed
with a tuba, my Steltron six string with the incapacitator pickups, a
bag of may I say fuckin' strong weed and the usual box full o' analogue
goodies and flutes. A few bottles of pop an all, just to get the
atmosphere conducive, like."

Mr Venus braced himself against the electrical bars with a massive,
sweaty outstretched hand. He wiped his chin clean of spittle and looked
down at his shoes. Rapley noticed that they were wooden clogs with metal
spurs spiked into the back. Dark stains on the wood, dark red stains on
the metal. Venus kept his eyes turned down and continued in thickened
tones. "Well, we pootled around for a while, y'know how it is with
tunesmiths, Mr Rapley. All diminished and suspended and minor for an
age. Til we could find a groove, is what it was... Well, must've been an
hour into it, this harpist geezer just swung himself into a major
progression and kept on going, blew the roof off the dump, and
everything he jangled and plucked, we matched, and this progression
turned into one chord, the notes inside just rising, you could 'ear 'em,
just rising inside this behemoth of a chord, and it just <I>encased
</I> us, we were right in it then, inside it and we started to change..."

Ms Bound sat unmoved by the story. Venus's fellow inmates had turned to
glance at him with something very much like interest. Rapley tapped a
nail experimentally against the cage before inspecting his finger for
mild burns.

"Continue," he said quietly, and glanced behind him casually. "Take your
time."

Venus laughed up some phlegm and carried on.

"I turned to look at the fella on the harp, by now he was playing his
own nerves, strung tight between the frames of his instrument. The more
he played, the more he seemed to be weaving these new harp strings from
his insides. Must've hurt like buggery, but he couldn't stop, none
of us could. Delmark was playing a ropey synth with his club foot,
stomping and stamping like he was crushing beetles, but with every stomp
something chipped off his skin, he was all leather underneath, last I
saw one of his eyes was just a slit in the leather and he had no mouth.
Betty the snake just flickered once and then strobed, her whole body
just glittering, you could only see her every half second. Carnegi and
Wilhelm were the worst. They both backflipped and coiled into themselves
like one o' them moebius strips, both just flowing into themselves and
out again all mercurial and screaming, bellowing jets of coiling flesh.
They both dropped what they were holding, a flute and a tuba went
clattering to the floor, must've been what gave me the strength to get
out of there. I went straight through the second floor window and never
looked back..."

Mr Venus wiped a cat's cradle of snot and tears away from his downcast face.

Ms Bound merely cricked her neck and huffed.

"This show of contrite melancholy hardly fits your vile character. I
don't buy it for a second."

Venus smashed his flat face against the bars and growled at her.

"I ain't contrite, you daft sod. It's just that chord was fuckin'
beautiful, and I've not been able to find it since!"

<div class= pullquote>(Outside a lock-up garage, down a winding back alley just to the south
of Brockwell Park, a small and compact man shook the rough paw of an
enormous animal in a dangerously stretched mackintosh. The creature
lifted his soiled and reeking hoodie and grinned something to which a keen
zoologist could possibly attribute the word 'smile'. The small man evidently 
said something of a sarcastic or insulting flavour, causing
the larger figure to flick the very tip of his club-like tail in his
direction, once. The compact man was now upside down against a rubbish
bin twenty feet away, and chortling merrily. The words "no time for
this" were muttered and they walked abreast into a nearby garage. A
bulky luggage trunk was opened and two sets of eyes were shielded from a
fierce azure blue light. The grimy walls around them swam with a
subterranean dizziness. Then, one after the other, they hopped into the
trunk and disappeared out of sight, as if they were walking down a set
of attic stairs. There was a shudder, and there was a screech, and then
the garage was quite empty.) </div>

Myrtle glared indignantly at the spluttering psychopath with his glazed,
pitted skin and the shaving rash on the palms of his hands.

She turned to Rapley.

"This man's identity is surely without doubt, such excrescence is
remarkable by its very uniqueness."

Rapley dipped his head once and moved on to the second captive.

Mr Hiram Gielgud held up a fat hand to silence the question forming on
Rapley's lips.

"Let us dispense with the formalities," he barked with surprising cheer,
loosening his spotted neck tie. "I'm afraid to say that I see where this
deceitful little sortie is leading us."

Rapley demurred with a shrug and a grin, whilst Mr Gielgud tugged off
his cherry red brogues and yanked his shirt open. Buttons pinged around
his cell like grapeshot.

Ms Bound and Rapley exchanged glances. Ms Bound's rang up confusion,
Rapley's displayed a flush, now busted.

"The game's up, fellas," chortled Gielgud from the corner of his mouth.
Low growls arose from the hulking Venus and the reposed
Wilkinson. "Our coat tails have been tugged quite long enough!"

And with that, the portly huckster squatted with his legs bent and his
body low and balanced, and ripped off his checked trousers with a
fearsome grunt.

"Wrestling..?", Enquired Rapley, throwing an eager look behind him, "Oh
dear, that was never my sport..."

Ms Bound sprang to her feet with a clatter and looked at the three
figures in their cages.

Gielgud, now quite naked apart from his dashing little bowler hat, was
leaping up and down like a baby on a bouncy castle, moaning and hissing
as if he'd swallowed a boiling kettle. Next to him, Mr Venus was
jabbering and smacking his wet fists into his chest, attempting to
regurgitate something. Wilkinson blew and blew in one huge never-ending
jet of breath, the air around him filling with a green mist which seemed
gritty and mineral-rich.

Myrtle turned to Rapley.

"What is this?", she said, her strained voice retaining some admirable
calmness despite the caterwauling menagerie in front of her.

As they spoke, they both stepped away from the columns of fizzing light,
columns which appeared to be getting fizzier by the second.

"My questions were merely a bit of time-killing while we waited for the cavalry."

The fizzing edges of the three adjacent columns began to spread and
bleed into each other, sparks burring like chainsaw thrashes where the
boundaries of the columns met.

"What we have here" yelled Rapley above the crackling din, "is one
distinct entity, something of a rarity, a celebrity among the more &eacute;lite
planes of evil where it normally dwells."

The figure of Benji Krestfellen began to bloat and swell, the throat
expanding in response to some terrifying eruption within himself. There
was the trace of an obscene grin upon the stretched features of his
face, a smile scrawled on an expanding balloon.

<p class="drop">"Perhaps you can fill in the many blanks while we run," hissed Ms Bound
through her ever-gritted teeth.

Rapley and Ms Bound turned on a brace of sixpences and dashed away from
the explosion of distorting flesh.

Behind them the three columns of light and heat were fusing together
into one churning, molten morass of activity. A sheet of yellow heat
waved out towards them like a whipped blanket, and an orange shower of
sparks splashed onto the marble floor.

At the very centre of this localized volcano a face was
beginning to edge into being, features etched by flicks of flame and the
tiny shadowy undercurrents of heat haze shimmers. It was a leering,
gurning, asinine face, too long in the muzzle and too high and far apart
in the eyes to be human, and yet too expressive and smooth of skin to
truly be a beast. It was as if a human face was hatching something
dumbly evil from inside itself and had been caught in the act by a
changing wind.

Myrtle and Rapley skidded to a stop by the Observatory door and chanced
a look back. A broad, shining wall of flame and heat stood where
Gielgud, Venus and Wilkinson had once been. The great idiotic and brutal
face like that of a shaved donkey was slowly emerging from the fiery
curtain, followed by two stubby arms with long, sharp fingers tensed and
segmented like spiders' legs. The flames dripped off the muzzle and
claws like water.

"Ms Bound!" yelled Rapley above the clamour, "Meet a monster of many
names! In Norwegian legend they called it Grisoya Undergang! The
Czechs knew the old chap as Kuzostrov Bolest, while those mellifluous
Frenchies favoured the rather more poetic Monstreux peau &icirc;le de la
douleur!"

A pair of hooved legs burst through the wall of flame like muscled
creatures surfacing from the deepest realms of the oceans.

"In England," said Rapley in a low, dark voice, "We called him
Splitskin."

The beast in flames took heavy steps forward, the sound of sizzling meat
greeting every footstep as his flesh hooves slapped down against the
marble.

"YES, MISSTER RAPPLLEY," blared the foghorn of his voice, "I SEEE MY
REPPUTATIONNN PRECEEEDESS MEEE!"

It paused and stumbled slightly then shook its wild head, the skin
around its mouth tightening as it readjusted tendons and muscles,
reconfiguring them for the clarity of its speech.

The imbecilic eyes of the creature swivelled inwards until the irises
had quite disappeared.

"ALL ABOARD?" boomed Splitskin, still dripping licks of flame. Then the
eyes popped back into view and wobbled into some semblance of binocular
focus. And with a feverish waggle of its lean claws, the beast began to
run after the fleeing humans.

"It is, in essence, a Chronoleviathan!" exclaimed Rapley as they dashed
through the corridors of the Museum. "That lumbering form is truly
graceless and not a fair reflection of its mental agility or cunning!"

He skidded to a stop by a brass fifth-dimensional telescope.

"You see, when it settles in time on its own for any extended period its
flesh tends to corrupt. Consequently it favours using a host or hosts to
house its appalling self for shorter periods of time - several years at a
pop, normally."

From behind them came a slurp and a roar and a crackle of burning flesh.
The floor and
walls vibrated with fear.

"Rapley!" urged Ms Bound, tugging at his elbow.

"Yes, quite," said Rapley, still deep in explanation, "The hosts tend
towards mental disturbance and disintegration before their bodies
putrefy and fall away like crumbling masonry."

Ms Bound gave his elbow an urgent heave and he flew after
her, momentum turning his stumbling steps into long bouncing strides.
Splitskin squelched and lumbered after them, giggling threats.

"Then those three men..?" said Bound, breathing in spurts as the chase
continued.

"Real people,", replied Rapley as his long legs blurred below him, "But
hijacked by Old Mister Splitskin at one time or another for their
proximity to those succulent attractive fruits strewn through the
years!"

They rounded the last corner before the hallway at a lick, knocking over
a fishbowl of primordial swamp as they did so.

"And the significance of those objects I collected? The brain, the drugs
and that frightful red matter..?"

"Aha!" grinned Rapley as they hurried down the aisles of the hall, "The
cavalry!" At the very end of the hallway an aquatic blue light had
begun to spread from the entry portal.

"What did it want them for?" yelled Myrtle as display cases and scrolls
crashed and scattered behind them, rent and cracked by sharp claws and
heavy, square teeth.

Rapley turned to face her with a disappointed sigh.

"A brain, a nervous system and a powerful, physical force that acts as
an osmotic, parasitical engine. He was making a body. A new one which
wouldn"t wear out, and which doesn"t stress like this crumbling
monstrosity he's reverted back to."

A shockwave of immense disturbance rumbled through the floor beneath
their feet and a shower of gilded debris rained down upon their heads.
Rapley and Bound threw themselves to the ground, scrabbling a path
through the detritus towards the glowing blue gateway.

The dread, just-boiled features of the fiend loomed into view above
them. A heavily sweating flesh hoof thumped the floor in front. Sharp
and segmented claws knitted the air by their faces.

Splitskin slowly hoisted a grin onto his muzzle and his booming voice
sent slews of drool smacking against them.

"I THINK WE SHALL END THE DANCE HERE, MISS BOUND." He sniffed the air
with the nozzles of his nostrils. "MY NEW BODY AWAITS. HIDDEN IN
INSTALMENTS LIKE A CHEAP STORY, BUT I HAVE THE SCENT OF THEM NOW, IT
SHAN'T BE TOO LONG A BATTLE TO RESTORE THEM TO A WHOLE."

He stamped his other hoof and a sharp, horizontal rip appeared in the
flesh above the knee. Another tear fell loose and ragged over his ankle.

He sighed a small hurricane and an easel on the south side of the hall
splintered with the force of it.

"SEE? IT IS HAPPENING ALREADY. I APPEAR TO BE ROTTING MYSELF THROUGH."
Splitskin settled onto his haunches and angled his head at Rapley and Ms
Bound.

"I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THIS NEW PHYSICAL SELF I PLAN TO BUILD. AND THIS
TUB DOESN"T SEEM SO BAD, A FRIGATE FOR MY FLEET... AND EVEN A PLANET ABOVE
TO TASTE - LET US HOPE THEY HAVE SOME RIPE SPECIMENS OF LIFE UP THERE TO
FEAST UPON!"

Rapley rose to his feet as Bound stared at him with some alarm.

"Whilst it's always good to have ambition, my friend, I rather think
you're taking this makeover of yours for granted. One thing at a time,
after all."

Splitskin's heavy head lowered itself to face Rapley, and the mouth
mooed its heavy syllables.

"I SEE NO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS, FRIEND. ONE BITE AND THE TROUBLESOME
MISS BOUND LOSES MORE THAN MERELY HER OUTER COVERING. AND YOU, I SHALL
USE AS A TOOTHPICK."

The gateway behind them expanded like a soap bubble, shivered and
screeched, and then popped monstrously. Splitskin rubbed the afterglow
from his eyes with the end-spines of his claws and blinked slowly. There
stood a small, tidy, squareish human with a face full of dark ginger
bristles and a scowl of determination. He aimed a blunt, fat revolver
and spoke from the side of his mouth.

"Say the word, Mr Rapley." muttered Mr Violet.

Such a tiny man, thought Splitskin, and such a tiny gun.

The gateway issued forth a more tumultuous belch and an immense shadowy
form shot through into the hallway, tumbling like a blurred landfall of
rough hay and rougher leather.

"Good Lord..." chattered Ms Bound from her position prostrate upon the
floor.

The new arrival smashed through a suit of armour fashioned from
supernova-iron and rolled heavily to a slumped halt in front of Rapley.

Splitskin peered at the vast mass of muscle, horn and shank, all rolled
up into a protective ball. He gave the side of it an experimental
poke with one of his claws.

"A FURRED CANNONBALL? REMARKABLE THOUGHT. BUT QUITE INEFFECTIVE NOW IT
HAS MISSED ITS TARGET."

Rapley winked at him.

"Meet the cavalry."

A gap sagged open in the fur, then another. Two bloodshot yellow orbs
stared up at the terrible Mister Splitskin, pinpricks of black at their
centres. Something long, grey and full of wet, slobbery mass slumped
from beneath the eyes, nostrils twitching at the end of it. Sharp tufted
pyramids sprang to attention somewhere atop the matted pelt.

Then the noises began.

A deeply muffled growl reverberated from inside the blinking furball,
decibels massing and rising until they had reached car crash volumes.
The whoosh of a harshly whipping wind accompanied the growls, and was
almost immediately joined by a braying honk, the three noises settling
together into a three pronged attack upon the very idea of aural
tolerance. The balled creature shook, bristled and drummed with a
ferocious heartbeat before it unfurled, stretching strong limbs fore and
aft from the dense block of fur and hide at its centre. It stumbled to
its clawed hooves, revealing itself to be almost as tall as Mr
Splitskin. Upright, its face seemed almost to make sense: those bulbous
eyes, blunt tusks of chipped ivory, a long, sagging grin and a stout
trunk leaking spurts of mucus.

It spoke, and the voice was more like weather than a tool for speech.

"Fucking... travelsick..." its stomach gurgled, "Shouldn't have had the
soup..."

Rapley bowed deep and low.

"Thank you, Fangles. Many apologies for the emergency call."

Splitskin stomped his way between Rapley and the new arrivals.

"YOU," he said, appraising Fangles, "WILL BE MORE FUN TO DISEMBOWEL!"

Rapley winced. "May I present Mr Violet, my accountant and amanuensis,
and Pompodour Aloysious Fangles the third, ravenous major in exegesis of
the Hyperiotic Space Malouche, and large hairy mammal with a magnificent
kill-rate." He turned smartly to face Ms Bound, "Run!"

They ran.

Splitskin and Fangles smashed into one thrashing block of activity, fur
and teeth and spurts of blood whipping out as they rolled across the
Museum floor. Rapley, Violet and Ms Bound dashed to the far end of the
room, searching for shelter from the rain of debris caused by the
duelling beasts.

Mr Violet scudded to a stop in front of the hulking body of Youngman's
Bathysphere.

"Into the sub!" he yelled, yanking the heavy front hatchway open with
both hands and no little effort.

With a foot-up from Violet, Rapley and Myrtle scuttled up the narrow
ladder and through the high oval hatch, toppling into the cramped iron
interior. They scrabbled to their feet and hauled Violet up after them.

Outside, the two beasts swept across the museum locked in a snarling
duel, sending cresting waves of splintered wood and metal, shredded
flesh and fur whirling throughout the hall.

Rapley kicked away the ladder and pointed to the cluttered control panel.

"Upwards and onwards, Violet, old pal!"

Violet huffed over the controls, clicking and flicking as the localized
war raged away and shook the Bathysphere on its cast iron tether.

Mr Violet depressed a thick, square button of brightest red, and the
walls gave a stuttering cough and chugged rhythmically.

Violet grinned through his moustache.

"Good to go, Mister Rapley!"

Ms Bound joined Pasha at the hatchway.

"Charge!" they yelled in unison.

A bank of tiny rockets fired into life on the rear
of the Bathysphere as the engines kicked into full power. The
vehicle began to shudder forward, straining against the chain that
secured it to the ceiling.

Rapley and Bound held onto the lip of the open hatchway as the
Bathysphere lurched and broke free of the tether, links of steel chain
fluttering in the wake of the engines like sycamore leaves. A shock wave of rushing air flew through the
hatchway, sending Pasha and Myrtle flying against the back wall. Violet
clung onto the control panel with that grit and determination which were
such core elements of his soul, tweaking directional controls with his
vibrating fingers.

The Bathysphere shot through the air, shearing Malthazar's N-Zone
Antenna from its moorings; decapitating a Titanian wicker man statue;
turning glass cabinets to fine, abrasive, swirling clouds of dust.

Fangles and the creature known as Splitskin drew apart for a moment as
they reached a momentary lull in their furious battle, blood and hanks
of flesh dripping from their claws and teeth.

Mister Splitskin was momentarily puzzled by a quick flash of alarm and
panic on his adversary's face. But the expression was gone as soon as it
had arrived, along with the animal itself, who was now scrabbling away
into the far corner of the Exhibition, its muscular rump quivering with
the effort of such a speedy retreat.

Splitzkin's muzzle curled with victory and pride. <i>Not such a challenge
for one as mighty as myself after all,</i> he thought, as he sensed a change
in air pressure around him, <i>Was that the noise of engines?</i> he asked
himself, coughing blood and turning his head with slow, dazed movements
in the direction it seemed to be coming from...

The Bathysphere smacked into him at seventy knots, his bulbous head
popping neatly through the open hatchway on impact. Violet's body
smacked into the instrument panel but he held her steady as best he
could as the vehicle crunched into the Exhibition's far wall, turning
Mister Splitskin's body into a far wider and thinner form than it had
ever been before. Rapley and Bound rattled around inside the craft,
bumping off the curved walls and landing heavily in a crumpled heap upon
the floor. The impact rang the Bathysphere like a vast iron bell and
sent tremors through every circuit and rivet.

Splitskin's head hung in the opening for a moment, his idiotic eyes wide
and disbelieving, his thin lips twitching and trembling. Mr Violet
clambered to his feet and cut off the engines. The Bathysphere dropped
ten metres to the floor with a hollow thump, and the head in the
hatchway slid down the curved interior wall of the craft leaving a
viscous red trail behind it. The nostrils snorted once, emitting a thick
vapour, then all was still and quiet.

<p class="drop">Fangles was keeping one eye on the jumbled heap of flesh and head which
used to be Splitskin. He growled at it occasionally through the
mouthfuls of porridge and ketchup which he was slurping enthusiastically
from a metal trough.

Around him, Mr Violet was sweeping up as best he could, forming mounds
of shattered glass and wood and bent brass in the middle of the
Exhibition. Any loose artefacts which had been found were stacked
carefully against one wall like lost property.

Ms Bound and Pasha Rapley stood in the Observatory, a scene of burnt
mayhem. The three columns stood cracked and vacant like the burst test
tubes of some violent experiment. Rags of clothing hung disconsolately
from the splinters of glass: a swatch of leather, a
hank of checkered tweed, a filmy shred of lycra.

On the floor sat Mr Gielgud's natty little bowler hat, balanced sideways
on its brim. Rapley stooped and picked it up. Brushing the dust off the
crown, he turned to Myrtle. "Case closed, dear heart. Though, purely out
of curiosity, I wondered if I might be permitted to see these items
which our recently departed guest was so exquisitely keen to make his
own."

Ms Bound smiled with her eyes and led Rapley away from the Observatory
with its glaring and fiery sentinel spinning far above.

They walked back into the Exhibition, past the freshly fed and
recuperated Fangles who grumbled to himself, peering out of the nearest
porthole and shivering with space sickness. Violet whistled hello and
went back to his clearance operation with its orderly and systematic
(but to Rapley and Ms Bound utterly impenetrable) checklist of
priorities and logistics. Violet threw a dented iron sheet onto a pile
and marked "153a (three eights of a singe)" in his notebook with a
yellow pencil.

Myrtle clanked her way over to one of Hercules Brabazon Brabazon's
ever-churning paintings. It was eight feet high and encased in a frame
of golden curlicues. She touched one side of the frame and depressed a
tiny gilt effigy of a micturating cherub. The entire painting swung open
like a door to reveal a shallow, shelved room. Myrtle rummaged among
some dusty ledges and came away with two large boxes wedged haphazardly
under her arms. She reversed out of the narrow room, plonked the boxes
on the floor next to Rapley and slammed the painting shut on its hinges.

Rapley bent down and popped open the lids. Inside one was a gleaming wet
brain, the cortices and nodes of which
seemed to be writhing against each other, turning and slapping like eels
in a bucket but still maintaining the exterior integrity of their shape.
The brain was encased in a glass bell jar, and Rapley removed it from
the box carefully, setting it down on the floor beside him.

In the other box he found hundreds of sealed blister packs and three or
so dozen small plastic medicine bottles. All contained sickle shaped
pills of a beige hue, or grains of some white substance.

"Murky and underwhelming," sighed Pasha as he turned to Ms Bound, "And
that sealed tub of parasitical muscle? Whither the red stuff?"

"Ah" said Myrtle, pointing to the devastated Exhibition. "It was right
there, at ground zero."

Mr Violet's smudged face popped up from behind a mound of broken easels.
"The red stuff, you say? Sealed tub? You'll be meaning 421/L." He
flipped to a page in his notebook. "Some wear, bugger all tear. can't
shift the bloody thing, though, it's absolutely pig stubborn!"
And with that he took a broom and brushed away a patina of dust and
splinters from the ground to reveal a broad, flat sealed container of
bright red liquid.

Rapley grinned, hoisted the two boxes under his arms and picked his way
over the hillocks of detritus towards the red disc. Myrtle scuttled
after him, wafting her hollow hands at the clouds of dust in the air.

"Rapley!" She tutted. "Come back here! Those artefacts are itemised!"

"Time to introduce them back into the wild, Ms Bound.", he smirked as he
let the boxes drop to the floor and knelt by the container.

He gently tugged at the rim of the lid, but there was no give.

"Violet, old pal? Lend a hand."

Mr Violet wiped his moustache clean of dust and squatted next to his
good friend. They each took a side of the lid and, after a count of three, leant back
and tugged with all their might. The container stayed still and
untroubled. The two men may as well have been butterflies for all the
effect their efforts made. Rapley sprang to his feet and huffed sulkily.

"Thought as much!" he said, handing Violet one of the boxes.

Rapley nodded to the sealed container and Mister Violet popped pill
after pill onto the top of the lid and upended medicine bottles of salty
grains on top of them. Rapley held the bell jar containing the snaking brain in both hands and
brandished it like a trophy.

"This"ll be a lark," he muttered. He raised the jar high above his head
and brought it crashing down on top of the grainy container lid. The
bell jar cracked and fell to either side like an egg shell, the slithery
brain settling down with a gloopy flop onto the see-through lid.

Rapley scampered behind a bric-a-brac pile of bent metal struts and
Violet jogged backwards ten yards or so. Ms Bound cocked her head to one
side and watched from behind a cracked display cabinet.

Fangles raised one immense hedge of an eyebrow and stayed exactly where he lay.

For a moment, all was quiet. Then, with a reverberation which they all
felt through the soles and pads and bones of their feet, the lid of the
container turned anticlockwise and unscrewed itself. The pills on top of
it bounced like jumping beans and the slithery brain spasmed and
twitched. As the lid rose clear of the container it seemed to turn milky
like some immense cataract. There was a hiss and a flash of white light
and the circular lid imploded into a disc of quickly thinning smoke. The
pills and the brain sploshed and splattered into the red soup, where
they sank slowly until they were encased in the substance, as if
suspended in aspic.

The white smoke had ebbed away into a ghostly halo, vague threads of
mist gently turning, expanding and growing ever fainter. Rapley counted
seconds in a hushed murmur. Ms Bound's finger bones tapped against the
cabinet as they shook with anticipation. Mr Violet ground his teeth as
he kept his nerve firm and steady. The moist panting of Fangles filled
the air with the smell of mulligatawny.

As they watched, the atmosphere grew increasingly heavy and charged, as
if they were all encased in their very own suspension of the unknown.

Then the red liquid stood up.

It calmly drew itself vertically out of the container like a column of
blood. The surface shimmered and waved briefly, and then formed into a
rough approximation of a human being. Currents inside the column caused
a split in the lower half forming vertical columns; the thickness of
liquid above it thinned slightly into a waist; jets of red spouted from
the block of liquid above the waist like shoots of projectile vomit
which then froze in mid-air, finessing themselves into graceful arms. As
the body formed itself, the capsules and pills dissolved into the molten
fluid, spreading a gritty texture throughout the trunk and limbs.

All the while the slithery brain rose through the liquid with purposeful
deliberation. When it reached the surface of the torso, it bobbed
briefly and then continued its upward journey, a bubble of the viscous
fluid surrounding it and carrying it upwards until it sat in a wobbly
crimson cranium.

The red fingers flexed and the apparition performed a brief jog on the
spot, springing athletically from foot to foot. The liquid inside the
form briefly effervesced with the effort.

Then it stood quite still and glared around the hall with the bulbous
pastiches of its newly formed eyes. The eyes, like the rest of its
facial features, were blank and characterless. They held no attempt at
lids, irises or pupils. They merely existed, impassively aware.

The apparition stepped sideways out of the bottom half of the container
as if it were exiting a shower cubicle. It stared down at the mess of
wood and metal and dust through its shimmering feet. The brain slithered
like a reptile inside that bubbling head. The form looked at Rapley and
its liquid features broke into the lopsided crescent of a smile.

"Ah," said Rapley, taking a step backwards.	The red figure walked
towards him with long, fluent strides, feet slapping heavily against the
ground.

Fangles cocked an ear and began to growl, his haunches tensing with the
anticipation of a fresh fight.

The red figure was now only a half dozen yards from Rapley, and
approaching with alacrity.

"Run, man!" hissed Violet.

"No need for alarm," muttered Rapley as he took another half step back,
"He's merely made of sentient jelly, no matter how heavy he may be." He
took a deep breath and closed his eyes tightly as the figure of liquid
crimson walked into him.

Just for a moment, as Rapley shut his eyes, the world was a warm and
freshly fizzling world of amniotic peace. A gentle but firm wash of
pressure blushed his cheeks and sucked his clothes against his body. His
hearing closed into a muffled swallow of bass and after a few seconds he
snorted bubbles. Eyes still closed, Rapley experimentally waggled his
fingers. They dragged in the embrace of a thick fluid. He blinked one
eye open, then the other. The world was shot through a swimming red
grainy prism, and the visual effect was not unpleasant. Lungs beginning
to tingle with panic, he flicked his eyes left and right and found
himself standing upright, arms stretched out to the sides of him,
encased entirely within the living suit of crimson liquid.

Rapley lowered his arms half a yard. The suit followed as if reading his
nerve impulses. Rapley lifted a leg and hopped, and his wobbling red
suit bent and hopped with him. Rapley would have chuckled if he had had
sufficient breath. Through his swimming vision he saw the solid figure
of Mr Violet standing in front of him, fists curled tight by his sides,
mouthing stern words and looking for something to remonstrate with. Ms
Bound stood beside him prodding the bones of her fingers against the
amorphous yet unyielding sides of the liquid form. There was a a blur of
fur as Fangles sped around him, trotting in circles with murder in his
yellow eyes.

Rapley gave a hesitant wave and showed his thumbs, but his heaving chest
belied such optimism. He staggered backward slightly as a sense of
fidgety desperation seared his airways. As he staggered, he cast his
eyes up and caught sight of the slithery reptile brain bobbing above him
in a stretched bulb of the red suspension. <i>At least I'm going with
dignity,</i> he thought to himself as his lungs were squeezed within the
passionate grip of suffocation.	Rapley's eyes closed and his conscious
thoughts fluttered away like leaves on the wind…



<p class="drop">He sat up, as quick as the snap of a mousetrap, choking
and gasping for breath. A great cough of red liquid splashed from his
throat and arced perfectly through the air. He watched as it curved in
front of him and spattered onto the dusty, wreckage-strewn floor. The
droplets stayed still for just a moment and then regrouped into a fat
puddle, as if an invisible net had been drawn around them. With a loud
"ping", they disappeared entirely.

Rapley wiped his mouth and watched the red froth on his hand bubble and
pop into nothingness in the same manner.

Mr Violet lay atop a mound of rubble to his left, shaking off a thin
residue of the crimson fluid from his hair. It flew through the air like
a slung handkerchief, vanishing before it hit the ground.

Fangles was shaking his mad pelt free of thousands of red drops,
sneezing great gobs of the stuff from his nostrils at the same time. The
air around him buzzed and glittered with countless rubies which suddenly
coagulated into one cricket ball-sized jewel. It bobbed above him,
wobbling with viscosity, and then took its leave with a louder, more
bassy pop which made their eyes swim.

"..it tried us all.." spluttered Violet, "..one after the other,
surrounding us and..tasting our thoughts.."

Rapley shook off his disorientation. "I felt it frolicking inside my
mind, leaving its mucky little pawmarks on the furniture." He made a
face like a cat exorcising a ball of fur. "Most impudent!"

He glanced up at Mr Violet, who was staggering towards the nearest porthole.

"Rapley. Come and see."

Rapley hopped to his feet and took his place next to Violet at the glass.

"He seems to have found what he was looking for." sighed Violet.

Outside, scant metres from the hull, bobbed the reclining figure of Ms
Myrtle Bound, encased in a shining, undulating, transparent spacesuit of
purest crimson.

Tiny circles appeared on the surface of the red suit as if droplets had
fallen into it, dripping as they arrived from the Exhibition.

Ms Bound saw Rapley and Violet watching her, and she gave a little wave,
waggling her limbs in the fashion of a delighted child.

Her voice shimmered through the hall suddenly loud, distinct and as if
spoken close up against a microphone.

"I have a new skin, new nerves which no longer ache with the sting of
fresh air, the coarse rub of rough clothing, the acid burn of fresh
water in the mornings. The beauty of the stars is reflected in my red,
red skin. I'm surrounded by a billion living, burning objects which shoot
through the cold vacuum on their own secret missions. And now I am one
of them - a tiny shining ember of curiosity with no boundaries and no
pain and no vanity to speak of. It says we can play forever, or until I
fall asleep. Though I don't know how I shall ever sleep with forever in
front of me. Oh, Pasha," here, the voice faltered briefly, "Oh, Violet. I
shall see the fashions and the feasts of countless new worlds. And I
will never have to worry about having to explain them to a single soul."

Mr Violet lowered his head and walked away from the porthole.

Rapley pressed his nose against the glass.

"Will there be tea?" Said Rapley.

The booming voice of Ms Bound laughed.

"Silly," she giggled, a hint of distortion crackling the broadcast.

"And will you write back sometime?" said Rapley brightly, "About wars
and alien hemlines?"

Ms Bound giggled again, a static sizzle running heavily through the sound.
"If time allows. There is so very much to see."

The red suit bobbed away into the void. They heard another burst of
static, followed by tinny laughter, and then the line went dead.



<p class="drop">One by one, they walked into the azure doorway. Fangles
disappeared with a mighty boom and an overpowering smell of burnt fur.
Mr Violet took a last look at the porthole and muttered "Cheerio, old
girl." Then he too strode through the shivering door.

Rapley wedged a couple of manuscripts under his arm and stuffed a box of
Krellian teabags into his capacious jacket pocket. As an afterthought he
picked up Mr Gielgud's singed and ragged bowler hat. He wiped some blood
off with his sleeve and wedged it on his head.

Rapley frowned as he looked around the debris of the Exhibition. He lit
a crumpled cigarette, cleared his throat and addressed the hall. "If
there is anything alive in here, be you a brainy microbe with bat ears,
an invisible Banachee Merrigob, a clump of sentient cloud formations
drifting through the corridors. Be you a zincworm with a language
translator or one of those vile empathetic sponges from the sump seas of
the UMth dimension. If you're a Congealer of the Sygn, a Vanishing
Smiler... whatever you are, I can hear thinking."

Rapley flicked the cigarette against the wall.

"Well, look after the place, that's all. You're in charge."

Turning towards the doorway, he caught sight of himself reflected in a
porthole. The bowler hat looked idiotic so he took it off and kicked it
high and hard to the other side of the hallway. He noticed the heel of
his right shoe was dangling like a broken jaw.

"Oh, go home, Rapley." He sighed, turning out the lights.

The door gave a blue burp and he was gone.

Drifts of dust settled like snow upon the orderly stacks of wreckage.
The ship's hull creaked and hummed, the air ducts sighed, creatures
stopped holding their breath and stepped out of the air.

The true exhibits, finding themselves alone at last, blinked as they spread into the light.

[*ITEM] To Serve

[*AUTHOR] Matthew Kirshenblatt

[*BLURB] As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence
is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being. <br>
- <small>Carl Jung</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">We find her in the Gutters.

It’s like a bad corporate dystopian film noir: the kind they used to
scare us with right in the childhood. My partner’s still gawking on this
… travesty in front of us as I’m already at her side.

I can tell that it’s bad. Not terminal, but bad. She’s in a plastered
pink latex dress and she’s soaked. Why is it always raining in these
fucking stories that are always real life? Her leg is not supposed to be
bending that way.

But her head. Goddammit all, they did a number on her face. It's all
tangled dark hair, blood, and metal. Either they mashed her with a chunk
of stainless steel or she’s a girl that really likes her metal …

“Damn,” my partner says, kneeling beside me on the wet concrete, “Is she
even–”

There’s this low whine. At first, I think it’s interference. The
advert-murals in the Gutters never really work all that great to begin
with and with all the hack-jobs and shattered plasta-glass around it’s
probably a miracle that they give us this much light.

It takes only a moment to realize that the sound’s coming from her. My
partner’s better at following orders than dealing with people. I make my
decision quickly. “You,” I tell my partner, “check around for some ID.
I’ll talk to her. Go.”

I’m not paying attention to him anymore. I’m placing her wrist in my
hand to get a feel for her pulse, “Miss? Miss, stay awake please. Miss,
I need you to tell me what happened here?”

She needs to stay conscious. I see one blue sliver open on
the most battered part of her face. It's unfocused and muddled with
fear. I take her hand and I squeeze it.

“Hey,” my partner calls out, “I found a purse. Credits are still
in there. Damned if I know why they
didn’t take it. Says she’s a waitress nearby on the Docks.”

“That’s not far from the Gutters,” I mutter to myself and her: to keep
her alert.

I want to ask her what in the hell she was thinking being down in the
Gutters at night. Not even the cops come down here at this time: not if
they knew what was good for them. I want to shout at her, but it’s not
her fault. She doesn't deserve this. And looking at the injuries and
knowing no-one took her credit chips, this looks very fucking personal.

And that’s enough for me.

“Call it in,” I tell my partner, still trying to see if she’s breathing
or not, “Tell the Shelter we need some back-up and a forensic. And a
Talker,” I add, “definitely a Talker.”

My partner groans, “A forensic’s probably not gonna help. Cheapest
scanners in the world, man. Those fuckers are probably squeaky-clean and
long gone by now.”

“Tell them to bring it anyway,” I still can’t find her pulse and the
ground seems to be thrumming through me. There must be
a generator nearby.

“Man, we’re just a Volunteer outfit. Neighbourhood Eye. All that, you
know? That’s for the police to–”

“The only thing the City’s given us Gutter-trash is glow-in-the-dark
advert night-lights,” I’m beginning to remember that I’m pissed off and
that my partner’s a bit of an asshole, “The Guilds will pay for our
lights, but not our security problems. Scan her ID number through, if
you need something useful to do.”

I’m not surprised he didn’t do that. He doesn’t think too hard. Good for
the gun in his pocket – and not the non-existent one he tells the ladies
about – but definitely not for the details. But if she’s not from around
here, she could be in another district and out of jurisdiction. The
police there might be a better help to her if we scan her number. Maybe
she didn’t have time to tap that ID before …

“Um, man?”

I see it before he does. She is moaning quietly again and shifting her
head.

“Miss … don’t move.. We’re … we’re getting help for you …”

“Man, the number says–”

“I know what the fucking number says, you dumb fuck!” I’m snarling at
him and looking at the side of her face she just showed me, “Please,
just shut up. Shut–the fuck–up for a bit.”

I'm staring at a mass of burning circuits and mangled wires underneath
tatters of skin. I thought it was just the blood that made that side of
her head glitter like that. Good old Heinlein would have called her an
Artifact. I call this whole situation a piece of work.

I see a dark stream of waste flowing out of her mini-skirt. It smells
like liquid rubber and she's whimpering. When she speaks, her voice is
all static-filled pain.

“Please …” her voice reverbs, and I wonder if it's because her cords are
crushed or if it’s that half the skin on her face is gone, “No … I
won’t. I won’t …”

“Guy,” my partner’s pulling at my shoulder, “She’s a Number. Bought
herself out of the Slippery Diner. Not our problem.”

“Did you call up the Shelter?” I realize the thrumming beneath me is the
hum of her cardiac generator flowing power into her body. I’m taking off
my jacket and putting it over her body.

“Yeah, but we don’t have time for this. She’s just a …”

“Just a what?” I’m not looking at him because I know I’m going to punch
him if I look at him, “A Skin-Job? Is that it? Tell me, man, do you
think you’d still look pretty if it was you without your skin?”

He says nothing. His cowardice saves him from a decking.

“Call them the fuck up again,” I say in a much quieter voice, “Tell them
to bring one of those Artificers. I know we have them. So call. Now.”

He shrugs. I stare him down and he walks off. It's almost a good thing
we're in the Gutters. There are none of them damn Registration Officers
here to really cause trouble. Number-watching, my ass. Those
stormtroopers make my partner look like freaking Archie Bunker.


“H-help …”

She’s looking up at me. Her one blue eye is pleading. My hand is still
in hers. She’s cold to the touch. I know enough to figure that it’s a
circulation problem. She might have been warm any other time but this. I
grip her hand again.

“Help’s on the way, miss,” I tell her, “You’re a waitress at the Slippery?”

She makes a sound almost like a yes.

“I’ve not been there a while now,” I see the lights of the crew coming
in the dark, “best sushi rolls ever.”

I might have even seen her there. She could’ve served me and I would
never know it. She looked like she was somewhere else: hoping for a
night on the town. I might never know what happened. And no one ever
would if we hadn’t got here. She would have been just another lost
Number in the Gutter trash.

“Don’t worry, miss. We’re part of the Gutter Shelter. We don’t leave
anyone behind. Anyone.”

She looks up at me. The gears in the side of her face make a whirring
sound. The flesh part of her face that’s not fucked up is scrunching.
The metal part of her is shifting. A tear comes out of her one blue eye.
I realize she’s trying to smile, or cry.

It’s breaking my fucking heart.

I realize, later, when they’ve taken her away and my fingers hurt that
she’d actually been gripping my hand too.

[*ITEM] Sibyl

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] It's all true. Look it up.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Myksos was full of noises, though they
were not all sweet enough to send Caliban back to sleep.  The
high-pitched pulsing of cicadas, roars from argumentative old men
comfortably pissed on ouzo, bursts of karaoke from bleary tourists
fobbed off with cheap retsina, tavernas blaring bazouki music amplified
beyond sensible recognition.  And of course the persistent wash of the
Aegean lapping against the surrounding shoreline.

Inland, beyond the groves of twisted olive trees, dull bells clanked
from scrawny livestock on the hillside.  Higher, hidden from the ground
by stony outcrops, halfway up the steep seaward-facing slope where a few
thorny shrubs had rooted in rock clefts, a trick of the wind gave rise
to a deep hollow fluting as it gusted fitfully across the narrow
entrance of a concealed cave.  This inhuman sound was once believed to
be the voice of a Sibyl.

After some months of bureaucratic delay, Garron had eventually been
granted official access to the site.  Local inhabitants avoided the
area, whether through lingering superstition or simple inertia, he did
not know.  For whatever reasons, no research had been done here in
recent times.  Unlike the legendary oracles at Delphi or Cumaea there
was no record of association with Apollo, or indeed with any other deity
from the archaic pantheon.  It was this anomaly, coupled with the Myksos
Sibyl’s gnomic prophecy about burning stones, that had first piqued
Garron’s curiosity.

Clouded by legend, the origin of Sibyls dates back to the Bronze Age.
According to the Roman scholar Varro their generic name derives from the
Doric form ‘<I>sios bylla</I>’ of the Greek ‘<I>theos boule</I>’,
meaning ‘she that tells the will of Zeus’, although this is now disputed
by etymologists.  Traditionally female, divinely inspired, they were
given to blurting out ecstatic predictions, a behaviour which some say
was the result of inhaling narcotic gases.  

Under the Romans the original Sibylline Books, written in Greek verse,
were guarded by life-long custodians in the Temple of Jupiter on the
Capitoline Hill.  They would consult the oracles and prescribe
appropriate rituals to avert calamities.  Unfortunately the temple was
destroyed by fire in 83 BC, and only fragments of these oracles
survived.  A subsequent collection was made, and duly consulted for the
next four hundred years, but these too were eventually burned, this time
for political reasons.

Texts mentioning the Myksos Sibyl are very few, but they agree on
her oracular words: “&#964;&#951;&#957;
&#949;&#960;&#943;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#958;&#951;
&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#953;&#957;
&#945;&#960;&#972; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#973;&#949;&#962;
&#960;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#962;
&#966;&#941;&#961;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#957;
&#966;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#940;”, which translate roughly as “Grow wise
before the cold stones burn.”  No-one had been able to make sense of
this apparent instruction.  Garron hoped that by exploring the site he might
at least stumble upon a clue.

<p class="drop">Among those visitors who strayed off the hill path favoured by goats,
even the most intrepid climbers, finding footholds to be unusually
treacherous, soon chose less precipitous routes.  But Garron had trained
with a rescue team in the Cairngorms led by the redoubtable Andy McKyle,
a scrupulously safety-conscious instructor.  After making a careful
study of the terrain, Garron had discovered a way down from the top;
difficult but accessible, especially with the benefit of his lightweight
climbing gear.

There was nothing to indicate the nature of the site; no ruined walls,
no ceremonial markings, no evidence of cultivation.  Whatever there was
to be found had to be within.  As he manoeuvred himself to peer into the
recessed cave-mouth a penetrating shaft of sunlight caught the green
iridescence of a beetle's wing-case.  It glowed like a dropped jewel
against the dark interior.  Garron smiled approvingly.  <I>A
proprietary talisman</I>, he thought.  

The entrance was narrow.  Easing his torso cautiously through to its
inner ledge he flicked on his headlamp.  At first the light dissipated
into sheer emptiness.  He shifted his cramped position, accidentally
dislodging some loose fragments from the ledge.  Trying to keep the
powerful beam focussed, he watched them plunge silently into the abyss.
<I>No wonder others have been deterred from exploring this place.  </I>
As the light swept down into the unmeasured depths Garron swore softly
to himself when he suddenly glimpsed what was illuminated at the very
foot, and knew he had to make the descent.

It took him nearly an hour, keeping to bedrock ridges, ensuring the
security of ropes for what would be an even more strenuous climb back
up.  As he slowly neared level ground he entered a realm of baroque
splendour; a receding vista of rock formations infused with a display of
subtle colours.  From the sloping ceiling there appeared to hang
draperies like frozen aurorae, interspersed with a forest of cones,
needles and more robust columns.  There were what looked like outcrops
of glistening coral, pillars festooned with spiral ornamentation,
tapering spires rising from the distant floor, where the fantastic
lithic architecture was reflected by a still pool, half obscured by a
series of platforms or terraces, each with its own surreal
configurations.  Garron knew that he was witnessing the results
of thousands of years of geological processes.  <I>Could these be the
cold stones? </I> He was aware that many of the apparently solid
structures, so long undisturbed, were brittle enough to shatter if
struck accidentally.  His feet finally touched the surface about fifty
metres from the clear pool, which he saw was enclosed by a natural
rimstone dam.  The sound created by the wind far above had now become an
intermittent bellowing, which echoed and re-echoed among the encrusted
columns.  Even after the the echoes had faded he imagined he could sense
a residual pulse which continied to resonate subsonically throughout the
fabric of the cave, and wondered whether at an even deeper level there
might be a subterranean river.  This was a reasonable assumption, but he
could hardly have guessed the truth.  Switching on his camera, he began
to explore.

Garron was relieved to note that the air was breathable, although he
thought he could detect a faint tang of ammonia, which might suggest the
presence of bat-droppings.  Occasional scuttlings from the direction of
the pool confirmed that the cave system had developed its own ecology,
which he had no wish to disturb.  However, he did find signs of previous
disturbance; earlier probably by several thousand years, according to
archaeological colleagues with whom he later shared his sequence of
images.  They also concluded that there must once have been a far more
accessible entrance closer to the level of the cave floor, long since
sealed by a rock-fall.  Exact dating of the items would have to wait for
proper sampling and analysis by a fully trained team, but the success of
this preliminary survey meant that at least funding for future
expeditions should not be a problem. 

The skeletal fragments were undoubtedly human and almost certainly
Neolithic, judging from the artefacts visible in the same sediment:
ceramic shards, beads of shell and polished marble, even flakes of
high-value obsidian, which his colleagues believed originated in Melos.
A sheltered niche near the pool contained a blackened area with remnants
of animal bones, possibly of jackal, wolf or lynx.

Although he came to be credited with the rediscovery of the Myksos
cavern, Garron remained disappointed that in terms of Sibylline research
he had returned empty-handed.  Later expeditions, though valuable to
specialists in other fields of pre-history, found nothing remotely
oracular, at least, not for several millennia.  This was not surprising,
for the device conceived by long-term planners, and situated far below
the site of any excavation in Garron’s era, was not intended to be
discovered until a much later phase of human development.  It was
designed to continue functioning for an extremely long time, and was
equipped to re-locate automatically if in danger of premature detection.
This escape function had been programmed as an afterthought, when the
craft in which the Installers had arrived was accidentally seen hovering
near the foot of the hill by a startled woman collecting medicinal
herbs.  Her mind had been implanted with the necessary warning.  She
would spread the word in her own tongue.

<p class="drop">There is a faint unremarkable star, smaller than our sun.  It is called
Gliese 710, and is almost 64 light-years distant.  In astronomical terms
it is a 9<SUP>th</SUP> magnitude main sequence suspected variable star,
detected not many years ago in the constellation Ophiuchus.  In relation
to its distance its proper motion is unusually small.  That means it’s
heading our way.

It has taken more than four billion years to achieve the solar system’s
current equilibrium.  Gliese 710 is set to stir things up.  At its
closest approach it will pass within one light-year, generating swarms
of comets beyond the experience of humankind.  These showers will stream
sunwards, disintegrating as they sweep close to planets, becoming
meteors.  There will be impact events.

Deep in the Myksos cave a steady subsonic pulse confirms that the
predictive device continues to update information from that distant
stellar source, calculating gravitational fluctuations, refining its
vast store of accumulated data until the exact moment when those cold
stones become incandescent as they fall to earth.  

We have only 1,360,000 years until this occurs.  Soon we should start to
think about preparing to leave.  It would, after all, be wise.

[*BLURB] Time to visit the Inner City
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><b><i>The following extracts are taken
from the diary of Samuel Ohms. The diary was discovered wedged between
two novels in the Romance section of Ashford library. The current
whereabouts of Mr Ohms are a matter of some speculation.</i></b>

<h4>February 12<SUP>th</SUP> 2008</h4>

<blockquote>I have discovered another city within Ashford, nestled
within the confines of the world we see like a secret compartment in a
spy’s suitcase. Or more accurately like a shadow within one’s own body,
perhaps on the lungs.

I chanced upon it late last night as I was walking home from visiting
you, my love. As I walked from the churchyard I entered the maze of
streets which lead to Scullery Row and the town centre. At once a line
of matches seemed to ignite above and to the sides of me. The
matchbursts were a brilliant white and I stopped in my tracks and looked
around me. I was inside a cube of these lights, which sparked and fizzed
with an intense brightness. Almost immediately they were extinguished,
leaving my eyes to reacclimatize to the darkness. I was not in Ashford. 

A street sign of burnt metal and molten calligraphy told me I was on
Fraughten Street, and a black stone doorway breathed a stench of
cinnamon and meat toward me.  Something tapped and scuttled inside the
doorway. An indistinguishable shape slithered. I stepped backwards,
matches struck in a gateway of lights and I was home once more.
</blockquote>

<h4>February 13<SUP>th</SUP> 2008</h4>

<blockquote>I slept perhaps a single hour last night, if that. Then, in
the bright cold morning, I drank a pot of coffee and walked down to
Scullery Row.  As I walked across the point of entry, the lights
heralded my arrival and I stumbled once more into the gloom and dankness
of Fraughten Street.

This time a curious fellow stood by the stone doorway, throwing torn
passports into a battered top hat at his feet. His thin frame was
crooked and the skin had an unpleasant green tinge to it. He leered and
gestured towards the doorway.

I remembered your spirit, my love, your unquenchable sense of adventure
and I embraced the moment. My footsteps were silent on the wet stone
steps.

I eventually came upon a low-ceilinged cellar, a flooded man-made pool
with stagnant water sloshing lazily to itself, sprigs of algae bubbling
on the surface. My guide sat on a bench by the pool. The bench was
ornately carved into scenes of ruin and orgy.

‘A lazarus pool’, he sighed sadly. ’See- they are born in the pit
underwater, but the waters kill them instantly and reincarnate them.
Eternal rebirth just to splutter a few drowning breaths and see the
short panic of your life flash before your eyes like an
bursting aneurysm.’

I peered more closely at the filthy liquid and could just about make out
small figures in the weed-strangled depths, paddling weakly, sending
squalls of bubbles up to the surface, where they popped around the
fronds of the algae, giving the vegetation valuable nutrients.

‘My garden, and I tend it well’ said the gardener, spitting on his boots
and polishing them with a hank of leather. Then he threw them to the
ground and lunged at me, grabbing at my coat with damp, scrabbling
fingers. I turned and ran up the steps through a gate of light.
</blockquote>

<h4>February 14<SUP>th</SUP> 2008</h4>

<blockquote>I later found a ragged paper map in my coat pocket, possibly
placed there by the gardener.

The town purported to be of Ashford but the layout of the streets and
buildings differed wildly from the town I knew.

This ghastly street plan seemed only to intersect with Ashford at
certain designated junctures: at Scullery Row, at a bus stop and in an
underpass at the railway station, along the eastern edge
of the William Harvey hospital, in cemeteries. I chose the underpass,
flickering lights illuminated the dankness of the passage for a brief
moment, then I stood blinking in a new atmosphere, trying to read the
soiled map in my hands: the Germery, the north end. I walked on past the
vast brutal architecture of Bone Shard Harbour, with its moored
Men-o'-war and Coelacanths, the black sump seas burbling and
slapping heavily against the hulls of the gut ships.

I visited the public dissection tables and the deep vivisection wells,
and passed through pastures of neon and silicate to
the richer industrial areas of Carapace and Sprain. I travelled the
sluggish monorails that arc disconsolately through the low smoke-filled
clouds hanging like an awning over the city.

Tonight I will loop the endless Bleakways and may never return.

If you are here, my love, I will find you, and
together we will sing the dark hymns that the creatures of this city
howl to keep themselves warm.

But in my heart I know you are not here. For this is where the
living go to die. </blockquote>

[*ITEM] Prutt's Game<br> by Thyles Dudoriac.<BR>  Fissile, Sprent & Co.
2013
<br>- A Review.

[*AUTHOR] Don B Levitt

[*BLURB] This is just the second review published in Mythaxis. The
decision was taken because reviews of this important book in other
publications appeared to lack substance.


[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">At the outset we are confronted with news
reports of simultaneous but disparate events: a crop failure in Bhutan,
the death of an elderly American poet, the closure of a Chinese bicycle
factory, an archaeological discovery on a remote Scottish island,
rumours of vampirism in Omaha, Nebraska, an astronomical observation
which appears to conflict with current cosmological theory.

Prutt, when not engaged in his musical researches, sampling exotic foods
or avoiding amatory entanglements, is preoccupied with mastering a
frustratingly absorbing game called Solversion, and pays little
attention to daily news items unless they threaten imminent catastrophe.
We share his gradual awareness that the lives of people around him are
being disturbed, his eventual suspicion that the cause or causes of this
disturbance could be traced to one or more of the reported events he had
ignored, and bizarrely, that there seem to be inexplicable parallels
between these happenings and his progress through the increasingly
challenging levels of Solversion.

As we follow Prutt's progress through the game, Dudoriac generously
provides us with clues which may or may not prove helpful in making
connections between external events and the game itself.  Some of these
are inevitably discovered and pursued by Prutt, but others will be
spotted by the astute reader.  The challenge is to know when we are
deliberately being misled. Chapter headings, some bristling with
homonyms, match different game levels: Gates & Fêtes, Gardens & Wardens,
A-Trails & B-Trails, Para-sights, Crone City...

Throughout the text are scattered sudden microcosmic explorations, such
as the architecture of a breadcrumb, prismatic condensation on a
spider's web, the texture of perspiring skin, the colours in a patch of
lichen...  These may seem either like little party favours for the
attentive reader, or more like road-blocks for the frustrated, but in my
view they are rewarding both as fine descriptive passages, and for the
further concealed signposts they contain.

By the time Prutt has manoeuvred his way through to Crone City, in his
external life he has become deeply involved with Anna Logue, whose
safety he believes is threatened by another Solversion player.  This is
the mysterious Iryon Quarth,  whose subtle manipulations are revealed in
a series of startling dénouements.  The unmasking of Quarth, and the
breathtaking rescue of Anna from his clutches, bring the novel to its
conclusion.

In a note to musicologists, Dudoriac tells us that the structure of the
book is that of a six-part fugue.  I am willing to predict that this
aspect alone will provide a subject for future theses.  Others may, with
academic relish, pick out the allegorical and mythical elements, the
linguistic devices, the influences of other writers.  This is such a
disturbing, powerful and exciting work that such analysis is inevitable.
Dudoriac's insights into the psychology of addictive games suggest a
great deal of preparatory research, and Prutt's tortuous progress
through the game of Solversion is in itself a <i>tour-de-force</i>.
Dudoriac's skill in weaving credible links between the game, the lives
of his characters and the seemingly random news reports is quite
astonishing. For a first novel this is puppet-mastery of a very high
order.  Don't miss it!

[*ITEM] Famous Ashfordians No. 3 - <br>The Marvellous Marjoram Mouse

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB] The only sin is the sin of being born -<br> <small>Samuel
Beckett</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">There had been rumours of unusual events
occurring throughout the day. The gardeners at the William Harvey
Hospital in Ashford reported an atypical silence amongst the wildlife
within the grounds. Birds gripped their branches, as still as twigs. A
dray of squirrels scuttled up the drainpipes outside the maternity
wing, hopping like puffs of smoke from one windowsill to the next,
peering <i>en masse</i> through the panes of glass. The caretaker's
old, half-lame Manx cat dragged himself from his basket and swayed
mournfully into the middle of the main road. A passerby remarked that
the feline didn't blink as the tyres on the bus went over his body. 

When questioned later after his recovery, the orderly remembered that
the screaming from the maternity ward had begun shortly after 3pm. He
immediately recognized the screams as being qualitatively different from
those emitted during a normal birth. They were screams of rage and
disappointment and disgust, and they heralded the birth of the boy,
Marjoram.

As the orderly reached the ward, the doors slowly and stutteringly
pushed outwards, as if something short and powerful were leaning
against them. A face appeared low in the crack of the opening doors:
smooth, wet and stained red, with a viscous caul hanging off it. Tufted
with down, with an elongated face, the figure cried and coughed and
never took its eyes off the orderly, blinking as if it were underwater.
It pushed the doors open and fell through onto its potbelly, naked and
strong and a foot high. Behind the baby, a silhouette ran away down the
corridor and a new mother dragged herself from a cubicle by her
fingertips. The baby righted itself and then sat on its haunches.
Outside the hospital, the howling of animals began. The orderly saw the
concealed scalpel too late. 

The police were called but the boy was last seen tottering down towards
the cancer ward, sniffing the air hungrily. His mother disappeared
screaming and bleeding into the crowds outside, never to be heard from
again.

<p class="drop">It was said he lived in the air ducts and in the grime
and darkness and the dripping pipes of the basement, and in the spaces
between the walls. Boys and girls in the children's wing would tell
nursing staff that during the night a fat, pale, sweating child with a
long face had crept out of the ceiling and dropped to the floor,
entertaining them with a soft and skillful tap dance, his naked clubbed
feet clopping quietly on the linoleum floor. He produced flowers and
beetles and coins from up the sleeves of his ragged white laboratory
coat. The new arrival would display tricks and sleight of hand magic,
making signed business cards appear inside sick children's mouths so
they gagged and giggled at the same time. The cards were small oblongs
with roughly torn edges, fashioned from cladding or insulation. They
bore the name 'Marvellous Marjoram' in thickly penciled italics.   The
nursing staff, remembering the occurrences some years earlier, called in
the medical authorities, who temporarily re-housed the young patients
and fumigated the entire structure. For good measure, they shut dogs in
the basement overnight without any food. All was quiet for some months
before children started to go missing.

He was last seen high on the hospital roof, a small shinbone held
between his snarling teeth as he leapt from chimney to chimney, pistol
shots tinking the brickwork around him. News cameras caught him atop the
highest pot, his white coat flapping in the harsh winds. The camera
zooms in as a constable loses his footing and slides slowly, inevitably
down the roof. The child Marjoram throws a tiny skull that bounces off
the constable's head as he slides to his death. The camera finds
Marjoram's face once more; we see wiry whiskers starting to matt his
cheeks. His teeth are protuberances, yellow and dank. His huge dark eyes
never blink, and he bows, taking the shrieks and screams and hate-filled
baying of the crowd below as applause of the rarest and most welcome
kind. His smile reaches halfway around his head. Then another pistol
shot cracks off the tiles and he is gone.

[*BLURB] A chilling little tale.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"> Amanda shivered, still very cold, and
peeked around the corner. Her long red locks fell across her face. Ooh,
look at all the colors.

"Brendan, come look."

Brendan didn't come.  However, several other children peeked. They all
gasped. A vast landscape of brightly colored objects spread out before
them. There were large machines in crates and vehicles of all shapes and
sizes. Shelves lining the walls were filled with all kinds of delightful
objects, big and small and in-between. There were bikes and trikes and
balls and crawlers and bats and hats and gyroscopes and kaleidoscopes
and Seussoscopes and Seussophones. There were intraship netlink pads and
pods and pens and pins and all kinds of flashing, blinking, blaring and
blabbing electronic gadgets. Some machines ran on tracks, some up and
down walls, some across the high ceiling and some from one side of the
room to the other. There were many objects that moved when you told them
to move and many that just sat there and waited for you to figure out
what to do with them.

Brendan finally came. He said, "Hey, look at all the toys. From here to
there."

"And everywhere," said Amanda.

Ahmed called out, "Hey, mommy and daddy are still frozen like popsicles.
What do we do?"

Amanda and Brendan shrugged.

Nobody knew what to do.

More children, still shivering from the cold, poured into the vast room
full of toys, past rows upon rows and shelves upon shelves. Soon they
were all playing energetically with the toys, their chills quickly
forgotten. They found they could make things light up and make all kinds
of interesting sounds and move things in all kinds of different ways.
There was no end to the fun.

When they got hungry, they found they could make all kinds of different
food, which was delivered to them right where they played. So they
played until they were hungry and then they ate; and they played until
they were tired and then they slept. There really wasn't much else they
needed.

While their parents continued the long sleep on their way to a new
world, all their children – suddenly, inexplicably awakened – began
their new life much earlier, in their own new world.

Later they realized they needed more power to keep their world going.

Ahmed said, "What do we do?"

Brendan shrugged.

Amanda pointed toward the big wall switches. Amanda was smarter than
most. She figured out how they could get more power.

So they shut down the cryo chambers to get more power and they continued
to play and eat and sleep and play and eat and sleep in their own new
world.

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] The continuation of Martin Clark's thriller with a Byzantine
plot. Part 1 was <a href="http://www.mythaxis.co.uk/3issue9.htm">Let
Every Voice be Still</a>, Part 2 was <a href =
"http://www.mythaxis.co.uk/3issuev10.htm">All Avenues Closed</a>.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Unfriendly hands pushed me down into a
plastic chair. The hood came off. I faced the glare of an Anglepoise
lamp in an otherwise darkened room. I had the sense of being in a large,
vaulted space but it still felt hot and stuffy, even in comparison to
the trunk of the car. As kidnappings go it was a case of so far, so
conventional, although how they’d snatched me from under the watchful
eyes of my corporate minders was still a complete blank. 

A man perched himself on the edge of the desk, partially in the light.
He was tanned and wore a heavy gold signet ring. &quot;Vaughn Vermeer. A
lot of people have been looking for you.&quot; 

His accent was East End London. I figured this crew as retired villains
living in Spain who’d lifted me as a favour. It wasn’t that big a
journey from Marbella to Lisbon in a high-end Mercedes. This whole setup
felt more like private enterprise than NovaRus, my former employers. I
stretched my legs and tried not to wince. &quot;Then aren’t you the
clever ones.&quot;

&quot;Let’s keep this simple. Where’s the money?&quot;

&quot;If I say ‘I don’t know’ am I liable to get a smack from chummy
behind me?&quot;

He fiddled with his ring. &quot;If you want to act dumb over this, sure,
be my guest. We can take as long as you like. It just depends on how
much of a face you want at the end.&quot;

I sighed. &quot;Look, do me one favour. I need to know what you
<I>think</I> you know. Then I can fill in the blanks and point out why
this isn’t going to end well for either of us.&quot;

Another man spoke from off to my left. &quot;Mister Vermeer, why prolong
this needlessly? You will either give us this information now or suffer
under interrogation, but talk you will.&quot; His delivery was clipped,
precise and betrayed no accent, but it was definitely English as a
foreign language.

I twisted my head towards the new speaker but he was just a
grey-on-black blur. &quot;Why should I co-operate? It’s not like I’m
ever walking out of here.&quot;

&quot;I see no need to kill you once the funds you stole have been
secured. In fact I would rather see you on the run, acting as a
distraction for other interested parties.&quot;

It was obvious this new guy was the one calling the shots. &quot;I
believe that’s called giving the sucker some false hope, bud, so that he
plays ball. Somehow I don’t see this crew being too keen on leaving any
witnesses behind.&quot;

&quot;Nevertheless that is the best deal on offer. Or we can do this the
hard way, as the saying goes.&quot;

I hesitated, wondering if there <I>was</I> any mileage in co-operating.
&quot;Just tell me what you think has happened and I’ll take it from
there.&quot;

There was a pause. The shirt was sticking to my back and I could feel a
line of sweat trickling down from my hairline. Finally the foreigner
sighed. &quot;You work as an investment analyst for the Lisbon office of
NovaRus Banking and Finance. They have been stripped of liquid assets,
in their entirety, by a two-man team of Finnish hackers based in Ivalo.
Despite this seemingly remote location one man is already dead and the
other has disappeared. This was the extent of the investigation by
NovaRus security personnel before your employer collapsed as a
commercial entity. Need I go on?&quot;

I shrugged, or tried to. &quot;Why not, I haven’t heard anything so far
that makes me one of the bad guys.&quot;

&quot;Very well. NovaRus was founded on Russian Mafia money plus some
subsidiary funds certain oligarchs wished to squirrel away as insurance.
Although NovaRus is no longer actively employed in money laundering,
their backers take a decidedly ‘old school’ approach to financial
failure. Especially one of this magnitude, especially one engineered by
you, Mister Vermeer. Make no mistake, you have offended a group who make
this ‘crew’, as you described them, look like babes in arms. I intended
no offence.&quot;

The guy with the signet ring laughed. &quot;None taken, Zunz. I’ve dealt
with the Kombinat and they don’t mess about. Real animals, some of them.
If they stop at using a blowtorch and bolt-cutters then you’re getting
off lightly.&quot;  

It was tough to keep the fear from my voice but I laughed as well.
&quot;I’m well aware of who I work for, and just what they’re capable
of. Do you really think I’d be stupid enough to cross them?&quot;

Zunz moved slightly and I caught the glint of light on his round
spectacles. &quot;Oh, you had help, and from quite a novel source, I
will grant you that. Very few people would have thought to utilise a
synthetic personality drawn from a virtual environment computer game.
You are to be applauded for your audacity.&quot; 

&quot;You do realise how insane that sounds?&quot;

But I must have flinched or something, because when Zunz spoke again
there was a self-satisfied smile in his voice. &quot;I traced the
instigators of this cyber-larceny back through intermediaries to one
Juan Canasta. In reality no more than another middle-man but even under
the most intense questioning he denied any involvement. The most intense
questioning imaginable, Mister Vermeer. I’m satisfied he was entirely
innocent, even though his associates were as equally convinced they were
working on his behalf. Seemingly I was at an impasse.&quot;

&quot;Tough luck. Putting me under the hammer won’t change
anything.&quot;

From the suggestion of movement Zunz removed his glasses and polished
them. &quot;I said <I>seemingly</I>, Mister Vermeer. Canasta was a vain
man and as part-payment for arranging a finance deal he had his persona
duplicated within Shadow Corporation, a multi-player virtual reality
game. One of those described as a ‘full sensory immersion experience’,
using the Ultra-Reality synaptic interface. Not my idea of
entertainment, but it takes all types, as they say. Obviously you had
help from the game controller in circumventing its communication
protocols, such that Canasta’s real-world contacts evidently believed
they were talking to the genuine article. Bravo, sir, even if it has
ultimately all been for nothing.&quot;

There was another pause. Zunz replaced his glasses. &quot;Now, as my
associate asked earlier – where is the money? Give me the account
details of where your synthetic Canasta hid the NovaRus funds and all
this will soon be over.&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;I got stiffed, right? I don’t know how, but
someone dumped me from the game before I got Canasta to-&quot;

The guy standing at my shoulder smacked the side of my head with
something hard – almost certainly a gun. It took a moment for the room
to come back into focus.

Zunz sounded disappointed. &quot;Simple denial will not suffice, Mister
Vermeer, surely you realise that? If you prove tiresome then I will
abandon you to more direct questioning at the hands of Mister King and
his associates.&quot;

King swore under his breath. &quot;Well, thanks for the name check,
<I>Alonzo</I>. Care to hand out my e-mail address as well?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think Mister Vaughn realises the chances of him living a
long and happy life are diminishing by the second, <I>Harold</I>.&quot;

I could feel the situation slipping away and my future with it.
&quot;Listen! Please, let me explain!&quot;

Zunz sniffed. &quot;Do not try my patience.&quot;

&quot;NovaRus wanted to take down Cromarty Investment, I don’t know why.
More accurately, they wanted to steal the artificial intelligence which
governed the Cromarty trading database. It would know every-&quot;

&quot;Steal an AI? Please!&quot;

&quot;No, no, listen! AIs play games, AIs play a <I>lot</I> of games.
For some it’s the only time they get let out of the box. NovaRus found
out Cromarty liked to play Shadow Corporation and sent me in with a
virus. It screwed with the interface bandwidth protocols and allowed
porting of the AI into the virtual game environment, like it was a
disaster recovery transfer. It was then transferred <I>out</I>, but I
don’t know where.&quot;

&quot;And somewhere along the way you decided to turn on your employer
and empty their bank accounts? You will understand this does not sound
like a spur of the moment enterprise.&quot;

&quot;No, that was already on the cards.&quot; I took a deep breath.
&quot;My daughter was kidnapped, supposedly by the HanaMed corporation,
who forced me to carry the virus.&quot;

&quot;You claimed previously it was NovaRus and now it is HanaMed?&quot;

&quot;That was just misinformation on their part. I realised that
NovaRus had to be behind this, if only due to the lack of progress in
discovering who was responsible for taking Helene. NovaRus like to
employ family men as they’re more reliable, more loyal – or at least
they have more to lose. My wife…&quot; I cleared my throat. &quot;My
wife died in an accident and I found out Helene wasn’t my daughter, that
I wasn’t her real father. I guess NovaRus found out as well and decided
I was now an expendable asset, a cut-out should Cromarty come looking
for their AI.&quot;

Zunz sounded weary. &quot;You still have not mentioned the money.&quot;

&quot;A minute! Just after I introduced the virus another player, Duncan
Bonn, shot me. In the game I mean. That dumped me out but I still
retained a one-way audio link to his persona, so that I could hear what
was going on. It was Bonn who came up with the idea of plugging the
virtual Canasta into the real world and I was only too happy to oblige
by providing details of NovaRus accounts and access protocols.&quot;

&quot;You expect me to believe it was as easy as that?&quot;

&quot;Of course not! I was so closely monitored at home I couldn’t
sneeze without my line manager sending round a box of tissues. There was
no way I could ever cultivate the contacts required to find someone like
the Finnish hackers. Anyway, like I said, it was Bonn’s idea and he only
pulled it off because the game controller was in on it. You should be
asking them what happened.&quot;

Alonzo Zunz stepped forward into the light, his glasses two circles of
reflected light. &quot;Now there, Mister Vermeer, is where we have a
problem.&quot;

I felt my gut twist with fear. &quot;A problem?&quot;

&quot;Sandra Haas, the controller, is clinically brain dead. She was
found that way, still in her interface chair, smiling. Her autonomic
systems function but all higher reasoning is gone, almost as if her mind
has been wiped clean.&quot;

&quot;Uploaded, maybe.&quot;

Zunz frowned. &quot;Explain please?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;Never mind. What about Duncan Bonn?&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes. Duncan Bonn has a date of birth, social security number,
a virtual profile, a presence on several social networking sites and
internet commerce history. But he does not exist.&quot;

&quot;What? Look, I’ve played several games with the guy, of course he
exists.&quot;

&quot;On-line, certainly he does, but in the real-world he has proven to
be somewhat more elusive.  He has an address in Birmingham but none of
his immediate neighbours ever remember seeing him in the flesh.
Apparently he is frequently away from home, for extended periods of
time.&quot;

&quot;He’s a journalist. Plus he’s been doing research for some book
he’s writing.&quot; Even as I uttered the words I realised just how
little I knew about Duncan.

Zunz inclined his head. &quot;Yes, indeed, his occupation is listed as
that of freelance journalist. He has a steady, if unremarkable, series
of articles to his credit, mostly in obscure computer journals with a
highly specialised readership. But no, the more we look into Duncan Bonn
the man, the more he appears to be merely a sophisticated sock-puppet
created by Birmingham University.&quot;

&quot;A…No way! Then who’s been playing games as Bonn? I could swear
it’s the same personality each time.&quot;

&quot;It hardly matters now and in any event he no longer exists as a
run-time intelligence at Birmingham. I am afraid that brings us back to
you, Mister Vermeer, as the only participant in this affair that we
could lay hands on.&quot;

&quot;Doesn’t that tell you something, huh? Someone has been playing the
long con and I’m just the fall-guy.&quot;

Harry King shifted on his perch. &quot;But you’re <I>our</I> fall-guy,
Vermeer, so we get first crack at beating the truth out of you.&quot;
From behind me I heard someone crack their knuckles.

Now that the ‘stick’ had been produced I expected Zunz to step in with
the ‘carrot’, but he merely shook his head. &quot;I did warn you, Mister
Vermeer. I am here to ensure that the required information is obtained,
nothing more. When it comes to persuasion I defer to Mister King. I
understand he is quite the expert.&quot;

The big man grinned. &quot;Damn right I am. Amateur boxer, bare-knuckle
and gloves. I know where to hit someone, and how hard. Don’t worry,
Vermeer, you won’t die on me, or even lose consciousness.&quot; He got
to his feet. &quot;No matter how long it takes.&quot;

I had nothing to bargain with. Bonn and Haas had screwed me royally.
Hands gripped my shoulders so that I couldn’t twist away from the
incoming blows. I could taste violence in the air.

Zunz turned his head to one side, as if listening to a voice that only
he could hear. He frowned. &quot;Now? I must advise you that we have yet
to…As you wish.&quot; He pursed his lips. &quot;My apologies. I have
been instructed to take a more direct approach.&quot; It took me a
moment to realise he was apologizing to Harry King, not me. King
shrugged and walked past me, out of my field of vision. The hands on my
shoulders were removed. I heard a door open and close.

A young woman replaced King at the desk in front of me. She looked like
an Alice in Wonderland clone, right down to the head band and pinafore
dress. I blinked in surprise. It was Blondie, an &uuml;ber fan of Debbie
Harry, just as I remembered her from playing <I>Shadow Corporation</I>.
For a moment game and reality merged and I looked round, hoping Mazy was
here as well. If she was then Zunz, King and every one of his associates
were going to die in the proverbial hail of bullets. Or, if they were
really unlucky, she’d use knives. 

Life failed to live up to my expectations.

Blondie smiled. &quot;Hello, Vaughn. You look very like your character,
I must say, if maybe a bit older. A bit more grey around the
temples.&quot;

I looked at her, I looked at Zunz, I shook my head. It made no sense.
&quot;Why is she here? She knows even less about what happened than I
do.&quot;

Blondie slapped me across the face and I felt my nose break. It was like
being hit by a heavy oak floorboard. I cried out and snorted blood, one
hand clutching at my nose, the other held out to ward her off.
&quot;Stop, for Christ’s sake! Jesus!&quot;

Zunz looked away, as if uncomfortable at the sight of blood. Blondie
leaned closer to me, her eyes shining. &quot;Are you a religious man,
Vaughn Vermeer? I don’t see the point, personally, but some take comfort
from the idea of a better place, beyond this veil of tears.&quot; She
hit me in the gut, leaving me gasping. &quot;I enjoy the world as it is.
I enjoy inflicting pain.&quot;

I sucked in air, unable to understand how she could be so damn strong.
Then fear washed over me like a cold shower. &quot;You’re an
augment?&quot;

She smiled, showing perfect teeth. &quot;A short life but a happy one. I
have the strength to literally tear you limb from limb, although I doubt
Zunz here would appreciate the floorshow. You seem surprised to see me,
Vaughn, but surely you didn’t think your employers were smart enough to
conceal their preparations entirely? That virus you introduced into the
game environment had to come from somewhere, and those kind of geeks
like to brag.&quot;

&quot;What, you wanted to steal Cromarty as well? What the hell have
they got that makes their AI so valuable?&quot;

&quot;Steal him? No, nothing so elaborate. If you’d kept to the game
scenario I’d have been able to ensure Cromarty crashed and burned, which
was the whole point as far as we were concerned. NovaRus would have
taken the fall, eventually, and that would have been an end of it. As it
stands, all we can salvage from this is the money.&quot;

&quot;Should I even bother to ask who ‘we’ are?&quot;

Blondie patted my cheek and I managed not to flinch. &quot;I’d only
lie. Now, speaking of the money…Zunz?&quot;

He lifted a gun from the desk and stepped forward. I tried to get up
but Blondie held me in place like an adult dealing with a squirming
child. Zunz held the weapon to my head. I closed my eyes.

<I>Phut.</I>

It was like being hit by a narrow-headed hammer; a sudden stab of agony
that spread into a diffuse blossom of pain. But I was still alive.
Blondie let go and I opened my eyes. She looked at me, expectantly.
&quot;Say something.&quot;

I blinked, fingering the spot on my head where I’d been ‘shot’.
&quot;What?&quot;

<I>&quot;What?&quot;   
</I>

I was talking in stereo, except that the second voice wasn’t mine. Zunz
put down his ‘gun’ and held up a control unit incorporating a small
speaker. &quot;There is now a direct neural interface with the speech
centre of your brain. I shall turn it off for now, but rest assured you
will remain able to communicate clearly despite the physical state of
your body, within reason.&quot;

I could tell that ‘within reason’ wasn’t what Blondie had in mind.
&quot;Christ, give me a break! How can I convince you I’m not in the
loop? I simply don’t know where the damn money is!&quot;

Blondie flexed her fingers. &quot;That would be very unfortunate,
Vaughn, as then we’d have no further use for you, would we? Now, just
so you understand, keeping you alive doesn’t require arms, legs,
genitals, eyes or even a tongue. As long as blood loss remains within
acceptable limits I can reduce you to a dumb and blind torso without
impairing your ability to speak, if only by proxy. I’ll choose where to
start but you can call a halt at any time, as long as you’re willing to
co-operate. Be warned though, I won’t give you a second chance.&quot;

Zunz wiped his mouth with a hand that trembled slightly. He looked
queasy. My mind raced, trying to find a way out. &quot;Wait,
<I>wait!</I> You’re looking at this the wrong way. Canasta, the virtual
Canasta, engineered the transfer of funds from NovaRus, right?&quot;

She frowned. &quot;So? That was just the ‘how’, not the ‘where’. Don’t
try and stall, Vaughn, I’ll just make it hurt all the more.&quot;

&quot;No, <I>listen.</I> I think this was always about the money and
lifting the Cromarty AI was just a smokescreen. I think this was an
inside job from start to finish – embezzlement, not theft.&quot;

Blondie stepped on my foot, her seemingly diminutive frame exerting
pressure akin to being under the hoof of a shire horse. Augments were
jacked to the max, with sub-dermal ballistic shielding, a carbon-twist
musculature and sensory enhancement. I had more chance head-butting a
tank than taking her on. She ground her shoe against mine. &quot;What,
a bad boy did it and ran away? Surely you can do better than that,
Vaughn?&quot; 

I spoke through gritted teeth. &quot;I’ll help. Finder’s fee.&quot;

&quot;You really are in no position to bargain, Vaughn.&quot;

&quot;You can’t afford to fuck this up twice.&quot;

There was a pause. For a moment it looked like I’d pushed Blondie too
far – but then she smiled and stepped back. &quot;Now we’re making
progress. There, Zunz, didn’t I tell you the feminine touch would work
wonders? Very well, Vaughn, explain to us why you believe someone
<I>else</I> within NovaRus is behind all this. If nothing else it will
make for an amusing anecdote.&quot;

I took a deep breath, trying to order my thoughts. &quot;Cromarty
Investment are small-fry. They’re no real threat to NovaRus, definitely
not enough of one to warrant sabotaging their operation in such a
convoluted fashion. I have to ask, did your backers say why they wanted
to stop NovaRus getting their hands on the rival AI?&quot;

Blondie looked at Zunz. He blinked. &quot;We did not speak as to
motive. I did garner evidence that suggests our operation was driven by
a fear that NovaRus knew something concerning Cromarty that was not
public knowledge.&quot;

&quot;OK, fair enough, it was a spoiler. Right, now, think ‘money’ from
the outset. I have knowledge of corporate funds and the means to access
them. I’m now classed as unreliable due to the death of my wife and the
knowledge that Helene isn’t really my daughter. They have less hold
over me because I have less to lose. Helene is kidnapped in a way that
makes it obvious NovaRus were responsible, further pushing me towards
what is euphemistically termed a ‘planned departure’. Duncan Bonn
suggests that the only way out is to crash NovaRus by stripping them of
all liquid assets. As soon as I give virtual Canasta the account
details I’m dumped from the game. It’s all too much of a coincidence.
There has to be a link between NovaRus, Birmingham University and the
game controller – Haas? Find that and you’ll find whoever was really
responsible.&quot;

Zunz frowned. &quot;Are you suggesting it was someone within your own
management structure? But if Cromarty were no rival to NovaRus, what
was the justification for such an operation? No, Mister Vermeer, simply
pointing the finger of suspicion elsewhere will not do. Miss Voss,
kindly continue with your interrogation.&quot; He looked away in
anticipation of renewed violence. 

But Blondie – Miss Voss – hesitated. &quot;The Lisbon office wasn’t a
big operation, Vaughn, you must know who it is you’re accusing. Spit it
out.&quot;

I wet my lips. Putting a name to a theory was going to create a
shit-storm for <I>someone</I> down the line. &quot;Arcady Petrov, the
head of security. He’s the only one who could have sanctioned the
Cromarty operation and arranged to have my daughter kidnapped despite
her corporate minders.&quot;

Blondie stroked my cheek. &quot;Nice try, fingering someone who’s been
recalled to Moscow and is probably dog food by now.&quot; Her hand
became a fist.

&quot;No, wait! Did he get there, huh? Check up and I bet you’ll find
that Petrov is in the wind.&quot;

Zunz looked at me. &quot;Even if that were true the failure of his
operation gives him ample motive to jump ship, as the saying goes. Of
itself it does not prove his involvement in grand larceny.&quot;

My mouth was dry and I had to cough before continuing. &quot;Petrov is
a jerk, banished to Lisbon when Moscow society tired of his drunken
antics. He may be ambitious and greedy but the man is no criminal
mastermind. No, he was part of this but someone else put it
together.&quot;

Zunz stepped closer, clearly irritated. &quot;Enough of your vague
theories and accusations. Either volunteer something of use or Miss
Voss will proceed as planned.&quot;

&quot;Cromarty screwed Debbie!&quot; I was conscious of gabbling and
forced myself to speak in a calm and logical-sounding manner. &quot;I
mean, if you look hard at the company hosting Shadow Corporation I bet
you’ll find someone was paid to allocate Sandra Haas as game
controller. Let me guess, despite her in-game persona the real woman is
a bit socially awkward? Few friends, maybe plain looking, overweight?
The Cromarty AI wasn’t the target, he was in on this from the start. He
cozied up to a lonely, vulnerable woman and seduced her, made her
believe they could have an on-line future together.&quot;

&quot;Arrant nonsense! Miss Voss, please-&quot;

&quot;Wait, Zunz. I’ve heard of something like this before.&quot; Some
part of me noticed Blondie had lapsed into <I>second position</I>,
indicating ballet training in her past. &quot;I know of a female
persona AI putting the moves on a guy, but that was straight-up virtual
sex, not ‘love’ in any shape or form, but I suppose it could happen.
Are you saying that it was Cromarty Finance who set out to wreck
NovaRus?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;No, well, maybe – but I don’t think so, it feels
bigger than them. Look, try this - someone gets to the Cromarty AI who
serves up Sandra Haas and thus the in-game Canasta, with his potential
real-world contacts. Petrov is in on the deal and mounts the snatch
operation as a smokescreen, with me as double-blind embezzler. Duncan
Bonn is the ring master, prodding everyone in the right direction. When
the dust settles I’m the only one left standing, holding a <I>very</I>
empty bag.&quot;   

There was a pause. Zunz laughed, he positively giggled. &quot;Do
forgive me, please. You have missed your calling, Mister Vermeer, you
should be concocting screenplays for straight-to-video thrillers.
Before I have Miss Voss crush your testicles can you offer up any
concrete evidence in support of this convoluted scenario?&quot;

The idea made me wince but I managed to avoid crossing my legs. My back
was slick with sweat. I wiped my mouth. &quot;There must be…&quot; The
penny didn’t so much drop as fall on me from a great height.
&quot;<I>Fuck!</I>&quot;

Zunz arched his eyebrows. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;

I made to stand up but Blondie’s fingertip on my forehead kept me in
place. I flexed my fingers as if trying to gather in theory and
supposition as allies. &quot;We’ve been had - me, Petrov, NovaRus,
everyone. Everyone human that is. I’m certain Petrov is dead, he’s the
only principal who isn’t cyber based, and that now includes Sandra
Haas. It won’t be the Kombinat who got to him, though, it will probably
be ruled a freak accident.&quot;

I expected more derision from Zunz but instead he turned to the desk
and lifted an ePad which lit up as his fingers danced over the screen.
Blondie looked at me with narrowed eyes. &quot;You’re saying this was
put together by someone operating exclusively via cyberspace?&quot;

&quot;Not just <I>via</I> but <I>from</I>.&quot; I took a deep breath.
&quot;An intelligence working out of Sensorium City.&quot;

&quot;Isn’t that an urban myth? A bunch of rogue AIs as run-time
nomads?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately not, Miss Voss.&quot; Zunz rejoined the
conversation, gesturing with his ePad. &quot;It would appear that the
Shadow Corporation game, and with it the virtual Juan Canasta, is no
longer commercially available. The company was purchased shortly after
NovaRus crashed and their hardware base has been relocated to
Kazakhstan. Coincidentally, the research project which spawned the
‘Duncan Bonn’ entity at Birmingham University was <I>not</I> terminated
as I was led to believe earlier. Rather, its source of funding, and all
intellectual property rights, now reside with a charitable foundation
based in-&quot;

&quot;Kazakhstan.&quot; I laughed. &quot;Oh, I’m way ahead of you,
Alonzo. We’ve been stiffed by the on-line equivalent of the Wild Bunch.
Game over, boys and girls - no winners today.&quot;
  
Blondie was clearly irked at the prospect of no further violence.
&quot;Can’t I just kill him anyway, Zunz? He has the life expectancy of
chocolate sunglasses as it is.&quot;

He raised a hand. &quot;No, no, Miss Voss, there is no need to be so
precipitous. At present the collapse of NovaRus is down to the actions
of one rogue operative – that would be you, Mister Vermeer – and his ad
hoc embezzlement scheme.&quot; Zunz smiled at me. &quot;As I stated
earlier, Vaughn, I am authorized to use every means at my disposal,
including financial inducement.&quot;

&quot;So we’re back to money?&quot;

&quot;Previously you stated a willingness to assist us in return for a
finder’s fee.&quot;

&quot;So I did, Zunz, so I did. What figure did you have in mind?&quot;

&quot;One-percent of the net sum recovered following the deduction of
operational expenses, or one million UK pounds, whichever is
less.&quot;

&quot;Bollocks. Given that the Kombinat think I’m the bad guy in all of
this I’ll need a damn sight more than a million to cover my tracks and
live happily ever after. Even if they believe I got ripped-off as well,
they’ll still hunt me down, just to prove a point.&quot;

Zunz removed his glasses and polished them. &quot;Undoubtedly. You
cannot run forever, but at least I can offer you a good head
start.&quot;

&quot;I want the full million, in bearer-bonds, and a way out of
Portugal.&quot;

He inclined his head. &quot;Agreed.&quot;

I relaxed, but only slightly. &quot;OK then. Well, I could go over
Canasta’s financials, the real Canasta, as the game version would
probably have used the same accounts. The money won’t be there, of
course, but it might give us a useful point of departure.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, Mister Vermeer, when I say that all conventional lines
of forensic finance have already been exhausted. No, your true worth
lies elsewhere. I wish you to take a less conventional line of
enquiry.&quot; 

&quot;What the hell does that mean? I can’t go wandering about with
every wide-boy between here and New Jersey looking for me. I’m no field
agent, Zunz.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but you are, Vaughn, you are. You have exhibited your martial
prowess many times in virtual reality games too tedious to list.&quot; 

Blondie laughed and even I snorted, which hurt. &quot;Like that’s
supposed to count for anything? Those games are as good as any military
simulator, I grant you, but it’s no substitute for real-world
experience.&quot;

Zunz smiled. &quot;But it is not the real world that I wish you to
investigate, Mister Vermeer, but the virtual.&quot;

I stared at him. &quot;You can stick it up your arse, <I>Alonzo</I>, if
you think I’m going anywhere near Sensorium City.&quot;

&quot;Yet that is precisely what I have in mind, <I>Vaughn</I>.
Currently we enjoy a head start over everyone else searching for the
NovaRus funds and it would be foolish to squander such an advantage.
Even if other interested parties come to the same conclusion as
yourself, the more outlandish rumors surrounding SenCity will dissuade
all except the most resolute human visitor.&quot;

&quot;And with good bloody reason! It’s one thing dealing with a
corporate AI when it has the on-line equivalent of a double-barreled
shotgun pointing at its head, quite another going toe-to-toe with one
of those rogue bastards on their home turf. No, forget it. You let one
of those fucks inside your head and you’re never the same again.&quot;

He took his glasses off and polished them again. &quot;Nevertheless,
Sensorium City is our El Dorado, as it were, and you will be my
Pizarro.&quot;

&quot;Bugger that! Send Blondie - Miss Voss – she’s cut out for this
kind of thing, even if she won’t have her in-built advantages
on-line.&quot;

Zunz lifted the neural controller, which I was less than happy about,
but a hard look from Blondie keep me in my chair. &quot;Miss Voss is
far too valuable an asset to risk in the unregulated and potentially
hostile environment you may encounter. The neurological safeguards
provided by an interface chair may well prove ineffectual – but rest
assured we will do our best for you.&quot;

&quot;Nah, forget it, it isn’t worth the risk. I’ll take my chances
with the Kombinat and anyone else snapping at my heels.&quot;

&quot;My apologies, Mister Vermeer, if I made it sound as if you had a
choice in the matter.&quot; He pressed a key. My world went monochrome.
I couldn’t move. &quot;The implant extends micro-fiber tendrils into
the surrounding tissue, using residual synaptic energy as a power
source. One side-effect is a progressive anesthetic effect, very useful
during brain surgery, and induced unconsciousness. We are sending you
to Sensorium City, Vaughn, first class.&quot;

The room seemed very far away. Blondie picked me up like I was a rag
doll. Zunz was a voice in the darkness.
