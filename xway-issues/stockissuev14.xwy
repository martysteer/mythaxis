[*BLURB] Welcome to the 14th issue of Mythaxis.



[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Welcome to the latest edition of Mythaxis,
Issue FOURTEEN!

This is, as usual, a very varied issue. All the way from Les Sklaroff's
idiosyncratic Snoak City stories to Martin Clark's Future Noir, by way
of Jez Patterson's thought-provoking dystopia, Liam Baldwin's
off-the-wall alternate history and Andrew Leon Hudson's latest
nightmare. Oh, and there's one from your editor, too.


Two important developments are introduced in this issue.

<ul> <li>Part of the delay in producing this issue is accounted for by
the revision of all previous issues to make them easily readable on
small screens. Currently, I have tested it with browsers on screens as
small as 240 x 320. Please let me know if you spot any problems with
your own particular pda / phone /tablet. The job was made harder because
once I'd made it all work on tiny screens, Internet Explorer on desktop
refused to co-operate, even though every other browser in the universe
was happy with the new formats, so I had to change it all again to suit
IE. You're welcome, Microsoft.

<li>In the last two issues, we attempted to award prizes on the basis of
voting forms from our readers. Despite there being many responses, the
majority turned out to have been filled in by spambots. Further, despite
our relatively large and growing audience, very few actual readers
bothered to
return their votes. So we will do what I should have done in the first
place, and award a book prize to all contributors we publish, as from
Issue 13. </ul>

So, settle back with your platform of choice and rejoice in the glow of
original new stories, never before published.

[*ITEM] A Closer Look at Greeming & Trulph

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] From toad to Multingale - it's all in a day's work.  And where
Smirt rules, there's no room for larks.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The shop door opened with a melodious
ping, gradually admitting a small boy walking backwards, his arms
wrapped round a cardboard box which reached from waist to chin.  Every
few steps he had to perform an awkward hop as the box began to slip and
needed to be pushed back up with a knee.  Each time this occurred the
contents of the box resonated with a mildly discordant tinkling, like a
chandelier caught in a draught.

From behind the counter stepped Greeming & Trulph's newest recruit, with
a welcoming smile.  "Hello.  Let me help you with that.  My name's
Myris.  Goodness, I hope you haven't had to carry this very far."  She
rested the box safely on a conveniently low table.  "Now, what can we do
for you?"

Relieved of his burden, and still a little out of breath, the boy used a
shirt-sleeve to wipe his brow. "Brix," he panted.  "Noffar.  Mida.  Sez.
Fican.  Gerrifixt.  Smine." 

Myris handed him a tissue, which he accepted gratefully and used to mop
his flushed face.  She attempted a translation.  "Your name is Brix?" He
nodded.  "And your dad said if you can get it fixed…?"

"Then I can keep it,"   Brix supplied, now somewhat recovered.   He
produced a slightly crumpled holocard.  "Dad said I should give you
this."

"Thank you, Brix.  Well, we'd better have a look at what's inside the
box."  He nodded again.  Myris glanced at the card, then pocketed it,
carefully lifted the box flaps and peered inside.  "Crimlings!  This
must be at least fifty years old!"   She went to a drawer and extracted
a small torch, a fine brush and a pair of calipers, and spent several
minutes inspecting the contents of the box.  Various sounds ensued: a
faint whirring, a cross between a low whistle and a drumroll, a rapid
progression of plucked chords, a silvery fluting which modulated into a
resonant 'cello-like vibrato, ending in a diminishing series of husky
coughs.

"Brix, I think you'd better take a seat while I have a word with Mr
Smirt."  She led him to a comfortably upholstered chair from which he
could survey an entire wall of shelves intriguingly stocked with
labelled containers, while she returned to the counter.  As he waited,
other assistants appeared from time to time, to collect or replace
items, or to consult one of the screens behind the reception area.

"Mr Smirt?  A boy has just come in with an early model Follard
Multingale in need of repair.   A boy, yes.  I counted all thirty-two
tubes, the fan is intact, and the central shaft is free from
obstructions, but I think some of the magnetic prisms may be out of
alignment, and a few keys seem to be loose.  Do we have spares, in case
anything needs replacing?  Oh, good.  Yes, of course, I should have
checked the catalogue, I'm sorry.  Yes, sir, local.  Park Street West.
I have, yes.  No, he brought it in himself.  Once it's working he'll be
allowed to keep it, he says.  That's what I thought, Mr Smirt, very
lucky.  Thank you, Mr Smirt."   Myris keyed a printpad, which duly
extruded a numbered ticket.

"Well, Brix, we think there's a very good chance this Multingale will
play again.  If you're happy to leave it with us for a few days, we'll
see what we can do.  A Multingale is a rare and beautiful instrument.
It's self-tuning, of course.  It may take you a while to learn to
control it properly, but I'm sure you'll enjoy discovering what it can
do.  We'll let your dad know when it's ready."  She handed the ticket to
the boy.  "Look after this, and bring it with you when you come back."

Brix beamed at her from the doorway.  "Thank you, miss.  I can't wait to
tell m…."   The end of the sentence was lost as he made his exit with a
surprising burst of speed, but a yell of what sounded like pure glee
could be heard above the dying chime of the doorbell. 


<p class=drop>The firm of Greeming & Trulph (Accessories) is still to
be found in Snoak City's southside commercial district.  There it
occupies three floors of a stoutly respectable building in Welfage Road,
and has managed to continue trading through the economic vicissitudes of
more than two centuries.  Regular custom has prevented the ground floor
shop from stultifying into a museum, but it has retained the original
crowded shelves, pigeon-holes, tiered drawers and display cabinets
familiar to successive generations, and a characteristic complex of
aromas which included beeswax, turpentine, sawdust and possibly hessian.
Although their goods covered a multiplicity of categories, G&T(A)
considered themselves specialists, in that they catered to very specific
individual needs.

Where else would you find a device for retrieving objects fallen behind
a heavy wardrobe?  Or obtain replacement stands, flanges, handles,
drive-belts, switches, wheels and spigots (all in an astonishing variety
of sizes and materials) for equipment which though possibly obsolete is
worth preserving?  Perhaps you need to diagnose the health of a tree,
repair a cracked stone, drill a right-angled hole, embalm a dead ant?
Such problems are child's play to Greeming & Trulph, whose cumulative
experience is seemingly limitless, and whose shop assistants, like
Myris, are trained to be unfailingly calm, courteous and helpful to
customers.    

In the basement, no such decorum prevails.  It is here that deliveries
are received and recorded, goods sorted, repairs effected, orders
checked, packed, addressed and despatched.  As a functioning system it
has grown to work reasonably well.  Most of the half dozen staff have
been there long enough to have learned to co-exist, and the banter is
generally light-hearted, although Frotty Proxton's lamentations seemed
to be drawn from an unfathomable well, and could be provoked by anything
from a misplaced pencil to a change in the weather.  In contrast, Ched
Pellet, her senior by several years, continues to tell, at every
opportunity, what he fondly believes are amusing anecdotes about his
adventurous youth.

If the ground floor is the visibly placid duck, the basement is the
strenuously paddling feet, where unseen entangling pondweed needs to be
shaken free from time to time.

The duck's anatomy does not allow the upstairs offices to share the same
metaphor, but here the atmosphere is less fraught.  Wielding benign
authority in this upper domain is the experienced Norry Smirt.  Smirt
had become an apprentice at Greeming & Trulph, partly on the strength of
his evident intelligence, but mainly because as a boy he had shown an
uncommon dexterity with string.  Under the watchful eyes of Braithe
Greeming and Scrythorn Trulph he had progressed from packing, at which
he excelled, to sales, where he was duly respectful, then to stock
management, which suited his orderly mind.  He was finally promoted to
his present exalted position, where he was answerable only to Nestra
Greeming, now an elderly widow with little interest in the firm's
day-to-day affairs, and to Plenitude Trulph, sadly orphaned after the
unfortunate incident of the so-called 'aerial' baboons.  Young Trulph,
now in his twenties, was content to leave the firm's resources in
Smirt's capable hands while he travelled far afield in search of
previously unrecorded prehistoric rock art.

From his office window Smirt looked out on to the rear garden, watching
the sculpted flaunts looping and spiralling among landscaped hummocks
and pools.  A movement under the far hedge caught his attention, and he
had the brief but bizarre conviction that he could see the questing
snout of a pangolin.  At that moment his e-screen buzzed.  He wondered
whether it was Myris again, but it was Pellet informing him that an
expected consignment of glassware had just arrived.  Smirt thought about
mentioning the putative pangolin to his two junior colleagues, but
through his open door he could see that they were in deep discussion
about an inventory problem, and chose not to disturb them.  He rubbed
his eyes, crossed the room, thumbed the slider and descended to the
basement.

"Nine boxes of pipits. Mr Smirt, not one of them broken."

"Thank you, Pellet.  Section B19, if you would be so kind.  Top shelf,
to avoid anything crushing them.  And it would help if they were
correctly labelled P-I-P-E-T-T-E-S, like little pipes.  A pipit is I
believe a kind of lark, and I'm afraid we have no room for an aviary."

"Understood, Mr Smirt.  A kind of lark, you say?  Ha!  That reminds me
of when I was with Zoony Filiver at Fodd's Crossing.  It was just
beginning to get dark when we saw this huge pile of what looked like
fishbones in the snow, and Zoony said…"

"Another time, perhaps, Pellet.  We've all work to do today.  Ask Mrs
Proxton to give you a hand with those pipettes, and don't forget about
the labels."

Yes, Mr Smirt.  Little pips.  I'll see to it."

"Not pips, Pellet.  Pips are for spitting.  Little pipes.  Pipes for, um, well, sucking."

"And blowing, Mr Smirt."

"?"

"Blowing.  Like blowpipes.  When we were kids we had this competition
with straws.  You'd chew a bit of paper until it was soft enough, then
stick it…"

"Ah yes.  Quite so, Pellet.  Now, if you will excuse me, I really must…"

Smirt turned hastily and strode with some relief back to the slider,
finding it disturbingly easy to picture old Ched Pellet as a jaunty,
gregarious, carefree child; the kind that joined gangs and indulged in
pranks, rather than the more serious kind (as he supposed he had been)
who enjoyed pursuing more solitary interests.  As he returned to the
office he tried to focus his thoughts on his next scheduled task, but
instead found himself wondering about the urban incidence of pangolins.

Pellet found Frotty Proxton deftly sorting a batch of small wooden
propellers into a purpose-built tray, its compartments of different
dimensions already tagged with their respective product codes. 

"Frotty, my little sunbeam, Mr Smirt would like you to lend me a hand
shelving some glass."

"Don't try to butter me up, you old wretch.   What glass?  And why
couldn't he ask me himself? 

"He was in a bit of a rush, poppet.  Nine packs of pipits, no, wait…"
He consulted a scribbled note.  "Pip-ettes.  Nothing to do with birds,"
he added helpfully.

Frotty frowned, looked up suspiciously to see whether he was trying to
make a joke, then rummaged in her handbag, and withdrew a small mirror
and an aromatic handkerchief.  "I'll be along in a minute.  Where's it
going, this glass?"   She dabbed carefully at various parts of her face.

"B19, Frotty.  Right, I'll collect some labels, then load up and see you
there."

She pursed her lips at the mirror, and for a few moments daydreamed
herself back through the years to a sunlit party on a lawn.  The sea
glittered in the distance.  She had allowed her little sister to weave
ribbons in her hair.  Her friends wore long flowery dresses, and they
all giggled when the champagne cork popped, already a little tipsy from
sipping cocktails under the polka-dot parasols.  Later, with her back
against a tree, she had kissed that handsome dark-haired boy with the
green cravat.  He had reminded her of the actor Trafford Croles.  What
was his name?  Tulver?  No, that was the pet tortoise.   Her eyes
abruptly re-focused.  Now what on earth had prompted that surge of
nostalgia?  Then Ched Pellet's words echoed faintly, and she sighed as
she made her way to the storage area.  "Be nineteen, Frotty," he had
said.


<p class=drop>The Follard Multingale had been moved to a repair bench,
awaiting the expert attention of Mosper Belk, a retired airship
technician who also enjoyed music, horology and horticulture.  He had
almost finished work restoring the simulated croak of a mechanical toad,
a repair job for old Crojent in Yarp Street, but he was distracted by
the voices of Harvis Drile and Strappy Underfox from the adjoining
sorting department.

"…not what I meant, Harvis.  Anyway, they won't bend enough to fit
comfortably.  And there's no point in supplying any of the older ones,
because…"

"They snap too easily.  I know.  Farglesharp would send them back with a
letter of complaint, and you couldn't blame him.  Farny's very
particular about the quality of his materials."

"Of course he is.  Remember the trouble with those blending sponges?  So
either we find a way to reinforce these things…"

"…or risk losing the custom of Farglesharp's Art Market, which would not
please Mr Smirt.  Let's see, what about a polymer bath to ensure
pliability?"

"…and a spray coating, say, of powdered quartz?"

"Yes.  Making each unit not only flexible, but strong…"

"Exactly!"

"…and mildly abrasive, so it could also be used as sandpaper."

"Good.  Multifunctional it will be.  Farny will appreciate that."

They moved away, allowing Mosper to resume his concentration on the
toad-croaking mechanism, a fiddly affair involving a membrane stretched
over a small drum which was struck by the rotating flaps of a kind of
miniature paddle-wheel.  This revolved by means of a concentric cog
which engaged the freshly cut teeth of a new ratchet.  Mosper relished
his work.  He regarded it as a form of healing, a re-awakening of
functions that had been impaired.  His sensitive, assured fingers made
final adjustments to the tension of the tiny springs, and he realised
how much he was looking forward to the satisfaction of working on the
nearby precious Multingale, whose glorious musical potential surpassed
even the most raspingly resonant of croaks.

Keeping the firm's inventory up to date, while still a vital and
continuous task, was no longer the laborious process it had once been.
Cabinets of bulky files had been replaced by neat portable e-screens on
which any detail of the stock could be made available, and the work of
an entire department of closely supervised clerks was now performed by
Norry Smirt and his team of two: Raeni Lorium and Selm Irringer. 

Both graduates of Sparagulan College, this dedicated pair had joined the
firm independently some ten years previously, and had found the work so
congenial and rewarding that the idea of seeking any other employment
now seemed absurd.  While they deferred to Smirt's experience, they had
in common an open-minded curiosity and the stamina to worry at a problem
until it yielded a solution.  Raeni, tall, her long dark hair neatly
pinned back in Pareonic style, had an unselfconscious
straightforwardness that some found intimidating, but her grace of
movement had always attracted admirers. The solemn-featured Selm was by
nature more reserved, although he could be coaxed to talk with
enthusiasm about almost any topic that had engaged his interest: the
construction of ancient coracles from supple willow and hide, the
fundamental importance of bubbles, the imminent extinction of native
speakers of Chon…  Raeni had been unexpectedly disarmed by his sense of
humour, and there had developed between them a trusting relationship
which contributed to their very capable teamwork.

"Trellis pins," Raeni announced.  "Three types: self-locking,
rectractable and quatrefoil."  

Selm tried to read her teasing smile, decided it was attractive but
oddly distracting, so put a hand over his eyes in order to concentrate.
"'Self-locking' seems feasible, but I'm not sure that 'retractable' is a
necessary option, so I'll say no to that one.  'Quatrefoil' sounds
rather too fancy, too ornamental for such a simple device.  I'll go for
'self-locking' only."

"Commendable logic, Mr Irringer," said Raeni. "'Retractable' was a
bluff.  But so was 'self-locking'.  As you said it's a simple device,
basically a plain brass rod.  And 'quatrefoil' is certainly fancier,
since it applies to the design of a decorative button - a totally
different product, but also listed as a trellis pin."  

"For someone whose integrity I admire, that is truly devious.  A button,
indeed.  Well, the earliest known buttons were of course decorative
rather than functional, fashioned from sea-shells. Bronze Age."  She
raised an eyebrow.   "Excavations. Chandus Valley," he explained.

The game they were playing had evolved naturally from their work, and
was designed to test their respective familiarity with the firm's
extensive inventory of some hundred thousand distinct items.  They
played it only when there was no active update in progress, and Smirt
was happy to allow such recreation, knowing it could only sharpen their
skills.  

Selm stood up and began to pace slowly.  He found that movement helped
his thinking.  As he passed a window he glanced down at the garden,
smiling approvingly at the languidly twisting flaunts, idly noting the
glint of sunlight on the scaly tail of the pangolin curled under the
privet. 
 
Raeni looked up expectantly.  "Ready?"

"Working on it.  Give me a moment."   Something was nagging at the
fringes of his memory, deflecting his attention.  "Let's see.  How about
bottle traps?  Are they height-adjustable?" He knew as he spoke that
he'd inadvertently given her an easy one.  Then he frowned.  "Thought
they were nocturnal," he muttered.  

Raeni answered before he could pursue the thought.  "I would have to ask
whether you are talking about plumbing or collecting insects, but in
either case I would say definitely yes.  Doesn't the non-plumbing
variety need to be hoisted into tree-canopies?"

Selm sighed.  "Your're right, of course.  It's just as well we're not
playing for money, or I'd be seriously impoverished."   

A winking light on the screen in front of Raeni signalled a requisition
from Repairs, as Mosper Belk itemised the parts needed to restore the
Multingale.  She beckoned to Selm, noticing that some of the components
were unfamiliar.  "Rotary baffles are no problem, and of course we have
oscillators and reciprocators, but what about these?"   Selm peered at
where her finger pointed.  "Paracoustic grid.  Hmm.   And a
quintillating coil!  These are relics of an earlier age, Raeni."  He
resumed his seat, keying in the Main Index.  "But we wouldn't want to
disappoint Mosper. Let's find them for him."  

Having completed his entries for the pipette consignment, approved the
revised Farglesharp order and signed the invoice for Crojent's repaired
toad, Norry Smirt settled down to what on balance he regarded as the
rewarding task of selecting fresh stock.  The principal sources were
end-of-line clearances, usually either 'unbeatable' or 'exclusive', from
wholesalers, or (usually more interesting) miscellaneous items which had
been the property of enthusiasts. 

If a visit to private premises was required, Smirt tried to ensure that
the firm was represented by members of staff from all three departments.
He had introduced this democratic strategy to boost morale, to serve as
a learning experience, to allow for friendly conversation and
occasionally to reveal initiative.  It was also in some measure Smirt's
way of compensating for the sterner discipline once exercised by old
Braithe and Scrythorn, who had maintained a strict pecking order.  They
would have thought it dangerously lax to allow underlings such as Ched
Pellet into a potential customer's home, but, as Norry Smirt had
confidently hoped, outside the building Pellet's attention-seeking
reminiscences had been tempered by a sense of responsibility which had
carried through to his ordinary duties.  In truth, everyone at Greeming
& Trulph had benefitted from this more relaxed and inclusive régime.
"They're a pretty reliable crew," thought Smirt with some satisfaction,
as he resumed the business of the working day, of which very nearly an
entire hour had already irretrievably slipped into history.

[*ITEM] An Excursion to Platport

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Young Brix presents a more-than-musical offering.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The house was unnaturally quiet, thought
Aoma Mylhirm, not for the first time, with that familiar unbidden
maternal pang, as she spread cheesefruit paste on a humal leaf, letting
it rest on the plate for a minute to allow the enzymes to interact.

It was late afternoon.  Relvin, a senior engineer at the
water-purification plant, was of course still at work, and she must soon
get back to her designing, preferring to work in daylight.  She had been
making pieces on commission for Smigs of Yarp Street ever since they had
accepted that first experimental gold bracelet with the double snake
motif.  It had been on display for only two days before being bought (so
they told her) by a customer who had enigmatically described it as "most
appropriate".   The tumbling and polishing machinery which provided a
kind of white noise background to her lapidary work was currently
switched off, contributing to her unease at the silence, and although
she had easy access to archives of musical recordings, there was nothing
there she could think of that would fill this specific auditory void.

She waved a finger at the wall calendar.  A trail of consecutive
squares glowed, the last five a brighter red, reminding her that Brix
would not be back from Platport until the middle of the following week.
Aoma and her husband had tried to find a tutor for him in Snoak, but
exponents of his chosen instrument, let alone instructors, were very
elusive.  Eventually one of Brix's more enlightened teachers had
contacted the music department at Sparagulan College, persuaded by the
boy's obvious enthusiasm for the instrument he had been fortunate enough
to inherit.  They had unhesitatingly recommended Dr Zorioni in Platport.

Lovingly designed by K Morrington Follard, the Multingale was an
extraordinary instrument, having the capability, under skilled hands, to
create and blend into a musical form virtually any
imaginable sounds.  It was an instrument that encouraged experiment and
improvisation.  Fewer than a hundred working originals were known to
exist.  None of Zorioni's pupils had come close to achieving his own
degree of mastery, although he had helped some very competent
performers.  He had been intrigued to learn that the young hopeful he
had agreed to see would actually be bringing his own instrument, which
had apparently lain neglected in an attic for many years before being
recently restored.

Half a century earlier Erigio Zorioni had captivated audiences in
concert halls and amphitheatres throughout the world.  He no longer gave
public performances, but was devoted enough to his art to want to pass
on his expertise to promising newcomers.  If he judged a prospective
pupil to have sufficient potential he would make no charge for his
tuition, even offering accommodation in his spacious house for the
initial intensive ten days.

The Mylhirms had duly travelled from Snoak City, and arrived by
appointment in Platport with their eleven-year old son, Brix, and his
expertly restored Multingale.  Safrana, the cheerful middle-aged woman
whom they presumed to be a housekeeper, led them into a large,
comfortable study, whose tall arched windows looked out onto a frothy
canopy of cherry trees. The lawn was strewn with blown petals,
reminiscent of a wedding scene whose participants had just departed. The
view was partly blocked by a high-backed chair, which slowly swivelled
round to face them, revealing a wispy-haired octogenarian.  He nodded to
the woman, who withdrew, and rose to his feet to greet his visitors.

"Ah, Mylhirms.  So pleased." He indicated a capacious sofa.  "Sit."
They sat, the boy between his parents, cradling on his lap a sturdy
custom-made leather carrying-case.

"And you are Brix?"

"Yes, sir."

"So this thing you hide so protectively in the bag…?"

"It's my Multingale, sir.  My dad made the case specially, after we got
the Multingale back from the repair shop."  Relvin Mylhirm smiled
modestly.

"And how much do you like this instrument?"

The unexpected question left Brix momentarily wordless.  The fingers of
his right hand involuntarily stroked the case as if it were a treasured
pet.  He beamed.  "It's great!  I just love it!  It can do anything!
Well, nearly anything.  I mean, I know I've not had it for very long,
but…"

Dr Zorioni raised a hand, a distinct twinkle in his bird-bright eyes.
"Soon we shall hear what you can make it do.  Perhaps you would be kind
enough to release it from its most excellent bag," (he nodded
approvingly at Relvin) "While I speak for a moment with your parents."
He beckoned to Aoma and Relvin, and led them through a side door into
the garden.

"Mylhirms, please to wander with freedom among my cherries for little
while.  I must assess how touch-familiar with his Multingale is your
boy.  Already I see he has the enthusiasm, which is good sign, very
good, but not enough.  Salfana will bring sandwiches and to drink. There
is seat and bird-bath.  Also sundial."  With this afterthought he waved
towards the clearing beyond the nearest trees, and left them to explore.

Brix took a sip from the glass of water Salfana had brought him.
"Before play, water," said Dr Zorioni.  "Afterwards, if satisfactory
playing, something perhaps better.  So, Brix, you are eager musician.
Now we will hear."  Zorioni retrieved from a corner a wheeled stand with
cushioned clamps and an automatic foot-switch.  "Please to rest here
your fine instrument, and bring that stool with red and gold seat.  He
waggled a finger at a side lever.  "You make to adjust for height."

The clamps locked gently.  It was a perfect fit!  "I didn't know about
these, sir," Brix said admiringly.  "At home it usually just sits on a
table."

"A fine Follard Multingale is like emperor, like great monarch," said
Zorioni.  "Deserves only best throne for display and proper audience.
Now sit on stool.  Before you switch on with foot, please to show me how
you place hands for starting play."

Obediently, Brix let his forearms rest on the wrist-pads, fingers poised
to glide or dart over the  arc of keys, or lightly press one of the many
as yet unlit sensors.

"So far, good.  Soon maybe I ask you to pick out some particular sounds,
and make mix for feelings to show.  Later we try different pitch,
rhythm, some simple blending chords, so on.  Ready for switch to play
first whatever you like best, yes?"   Zorioni returned to his chair,
closed his eyes and clasped his hands under his chin.  A little
nervously, Brix nodded, flexed his fingers, took a deep breath and
tapped the foot-switch.

In the cherry grove his parents looked up from their impromptu picnic
and smiled at each other as they recognized Brix's now familiar touch.
The piece began softly: distant bells, a pattering of falling snow, the
liquid trickle of a stream.  This was gradually intermingled with a
lilting melody, hesitant at first, on a single string - a 'cello,
perhaps, or a viola, continuing and strengthening the flowing theme (was
that a hint of Vlotana?) then merging with a playful burst of
syncopation on brushes and wood-blocks, before adding accordion and
fiddle to transform into an audibly fiery dance, complete with crackling
twigs and the excited barking of a dog. It concluded with a rumbustious
whoosh, like a sudden gust of wind, accompanied by deliberately
melodramatic sounds of crashing and tinkling, followed by the
unmistakable giggling of children.  Brix switched off, and the faint
whirr of the idling instrument died into silence.

Erigio Zorioni remained sitting with closed eyes and clasped hands.
Brix blinked, and stared at him anxiously, fearing that the old man
might have lapsed into a coma.  He'd heard tales about people's brains
being affected by certain frequencies, but he knew better than to use
the Multingale's subsonics or ultrasonics in the confinement of a room,
even one of this imposing size.  He cleared his throat.  To his great
relief, Zorioni's eyed opened.  They glistened with tears.

"Excuse, Master Brix.  That was foolish ending," he said, shaking his
head reprovingly.  Brix was crestfallen.  He'd only played what felt
right, as he always did.  "<i>But</i>," cried Zorioni, coming over to
grasp both of Brix's hands, "was also excellent surprise!  And not I
hope to make head big as grand balloon, but you have truly beautiful
touch and good concentration."

"Salfana!" he called, in a startlingly strong voice for a man of his
advanced years, "Please to rescue the parent Mylhirms, then take this
boy to kitchen for special treat he will choose."

By the time Brix was escorted back from the delights of Salfana's
kitchen (his appetite betrayed accidentally on his chin by a few cake
crumbs and the merest smear of cream) Dr Zorioni had come to a formal
agreement with the Mylhirms.  "The boy is raw, full of ideas, but also
little too…"  He searched for the precise word.  "Too precipitate, you
understand?  He will learn to be patient, more subtle as he grows."  He
dropped his voice to a confidential whisper.  "But I tell you, for
beginner he has already wonderful talent."  He bowed.  "Is my honour to
accept him as pupil.  Salfana here will see to all non-musical needs at
my expense."  He dismissed their protests.  "She will give you tour of
house.  After ten days we will consider what future for Brix and his
music.  Was most suitable gift, I think, this fine instrument.  Dear
Mylhirms, is belief of Erigio Zorioni for you to be proud parents of
next Multingale virtuoso!"

Aoma applied a dab of flux with a sharpened matchstick to her nest of
silver wire loops, used tweezers to add a tiny paillon, and neatly
soldered the joint before carefully dipping the piece into a weak acid
bath and then running it under the cold tap.  It was to be part of an
amber and turquoise pendant, for which the honey-coloured cabochon was
already prepared.  The sky had begun to cloud over.  That would do for
today, she decided, turning off the tap and walking over to the window,
which looked east towards Garrible Park.  During term time the street
would have been clamorous at this hour with the excited babble of
children returning from school.  Today it was almost deserted.  She
listened hard.   There was a faint hum of distant traffic, the
intermittent buzz of a hedge-trimmer from Welfage Road, a muffled but
querulous altercation between the young siblings next door.  Somewhere
nearby a bird was cheeping persistently.  Well, it wasn't up to Brix's
standard, Aoma thought immodestly, but in his absence she supposed it
was the next best thing.

[*BLURB] Quanderpyre is reborn with a silver spoon in his future.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Morton Quanderpyre's emotional range was
relatively narrow, but within this confined spectrum he was well
practiced.  He had absolutely no trouble with disdain, indignation or
indifference; they were the familiar background to his daily life.
Smugness also came easily to him.  Had he not built an empire by
outsmarting others?  It had simply been a process of making the right
decisions.   He had needed to learn how to use people, to probe for
weaknesses and take advantage of them.  There had been some necessary
bypassing of rules, even from time to time a little selective bribery.
On occasion he had been obliged to hire (always at one remove) unsavoury
types who would undertake persuasion for money, no questions asked.

At first he had been mildly surprised at the amount of resentment and
petty envy his determined rise seemed to provoke.  After all, he told
himself, it was only natural that someone with total confidence in his
own abilities deserved to prosper.  Those who complained he either
ignored or found ways to suppress.  He grew used to not being liked,
although somewhere at the back of his mind it remained a minor
irritation, like the buzzing of a bluebottle always just out of reach.
It was not important.  What was important was the ability to exercise
power.

At the core of Quanderpyre's being was an emptiness continuously
yearning to be filled.  It had the same primal force, and possibly the
same origin, as an infant's need to be fed, though his memories of his
own mother were vague.  When he tried to remember her his mind clouded
with a sense of resignation and an uncertain image of a frail,
ineffectual person with watery eyes.  The image of his father was
clearer - a stocky, red-faced, rough-skinned man with a short temper,
smelling of pungent hair oil and stale beer, and who had addressed him
only as "boy", never by his name.  He did not associate his upbringing
with any displays of affection, except perhaps from the widowed aunt
(his mother's elder sister) with whom he had opted to live after his
parents' separation, rather than remain with his mother in the
ex-parental home.  His father moved to Platport, where he had been
having an affair with a salesgirl, Cloreen Bletz.  

Aunt Rhea had survived forty years of childless marriage to Agar, a
capable solicitor with a rather dour disposition.  Their domestic life
had been largely uneventful, tempered by the ownership of a succession
of small dogs, which served as a counter-irritant to any minor
disagreements.  Agar's legal work had occupied most of his waking hours,
and he had been content to let Rhea pursue her own harmless interest in
certain kinds of antiques and curios.  

Unfortunately, Aunt Rhea did not survive long after her nephew had come
to stay with her.  She had fussed and fluttered about him for a few
months like a mildly demented hen, making sure he continued to attend
school (where he had long ceased to learn anything useful), indulging
his teenage appetite with quantities of home-cooked stews, pies and
puddings, jellies and meringues.  In comparison with the bleakly
functional home he had been used to, Aunt Rhea's house was cluttered
with odd pieces of furniture, entire drawers and shelves and cabinets
full of useless ornaments.  If it were up to him, he'd get rid of the
lot, he thought to himself, when his aunt had asked him if he wouldn't
mind giving her a hand with a bit of dusting and polishing.  The
opportunity for disposal arose much sooner than he might have expected.

True to his nature. the young Morton exploited his aunt's kindness,
feigning an interest in her enormous collection of commemorative spoons
and other fiddly old artefacts, enduring tedious reminiscences about his
late uncle Agar's celebrated legal clients in the hope of gaining
information that might one day prove of practical benefit.

After a brief spell of nervous exhaustion, Aunt Rhea had simply expired.
He had returned from school one day to find her apparently asleep in an
armchair, a copy of	<i>'Ladle and Spoon Connoisseur'</i> slipped from
her grasp.  When he had failed to rouse her he had gone into the kitchen
to make himself a sandwich, then came back to stare at her, at first
with a sense of indignation, then with growing excitement and relief, as
he began to realise the advantages of independence.  Quanderpyre could
not now recall who had arranged the funeral, or even who else had
attended, there being no other close relatives apart from his separated
parents. Morton found himself to be the owner of Aunt Rhea's house. By
the terms of Rhea's will, other than a small bequest to her sister, the
rest of her savings had been left to the local dogs' home. He vainly
tried to remember what it had felt like to mourn his aunt's passing, but
all that his mind's eye could provide was a parade of gleaming spoons.

When he began to discover that there was potential wealth in what he had
dismissed as clutter, and even before he learned that he had
legitimately inherited the Spoonhouse (as he surreptitiously thought of
it) and its curiously specialized contents, he had used several school
exercise books to make a private inventory.  His crafty old aunt had
evidently known what she was doing; some of this ghastly junk might
actually be valuable.  While his classmates were dutifully studying for
exams, he was systematically poring over catalogues, checking auction
records and collectors' guides.  At about the time his form teacher had
said "Mark my words, Quanderpyre, you'll never amount to anything unless
you apply yourself, lad," he was getting ready to sell the family silver
to the highest bidders.  Not to mention the beaded ebony bureaux, the
satinwood chairs, the early millefiore paperweights, the engraved glass
bandicoots, the miniature vases, bodkin-cases, Baroque fans, scent
phials and the antique hand-painted ink-pot, which in itself was worth a
small fortune.

By the time the young entrepreneur had cleared the Spoonhouse of its
bric-a-brac, he had put aside a substantial sum which was quietly
accruing interest while he decided what to do next.  He had left school
without any significant qualifications, but he had utter confidence in
his information-gathering and marketing skills.  Within a few years, he
he had no doubt that he would lay the foundations for an enterprise that
would dominate Snoak City.  He might even start his own special
collection; of what he had not yet decided, as he had yet to find
something that appealed to him, but it would be something extraordinary,
something others would be bound to envy.  It would need more than a
house…  He closed his eyes, breathed deeply, feeling his horizons expand
into a future firmly under his own control.  A pleasing idea struck him.
He would have a magnificent tower built!  It would be a bold, bright
structure, visible for miles around, overlooking the entire city.  Out
of yesterday's spoons would be born tomorrow's empire.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"Pterodactyl!"

The cry went up from further down the trench to the east. It was dawn.
Barely aware of his surroundings Tommy had no idea what had woken him
until his trenchmate, Corporal Brown, bellowed out the warning again,
"Pterodactyl!"

As Tommy rolled to his feet the shout was already a distant echo,
fading in different voices as it was passed on from man to man up the
line. The lieutenant emerged from his dugout. He was buttoning up his
trousers. "Sergeant!"  he called.  Sergeant Jones came round the
nearest of the trench's zig zag corners.

"Sir!"

"What's all the fuss, eh?"

"Bloody big pterosaur, sir," said Jones. "Coming up from the east."

He pointed needlessly towards the enemy lines.

"Sergeant..." the lieutenant had finished buttoning his flies and
was now trying to make what was left of his battered uniform sit
squarely on his shoulders. "Sergeant, what have I told you about
using language like that in front of the men?"

"Sorry, Sir! It won't fucking happen again, sir!"

Tommy dutifully laughed at the old routine.

"Pterosaur you say?" The lieutenant lifted the field periscope and
looked out over the trench wall,  out over no-man's land.  He twisted
the periscope slowly as he scanned the horizon. "I don't see... oh
wait...  yes... there it is."

"Is it loaded, sir?"  Tommy said.

"Well it's flying very low.  It's either wounded or carrying some
sort of payload." The lieutenant lowered the glasses. "All right,
chaps.  You know the drill. Get your Jerry hats on.   On the double! 
Go and get mine, will you, Corporal?"

"Sir!"

As Corporal Brown hurried into the dugout, Tommy unhooked his own German
army helmet from his belt. Battered and scratched, it was the one piece
of kit Tommy kept fastidiously clean - or at least as clean as he could,
given the filth and mire of the trench.  He swiftly took off his
standard issue British 'dinnerplate' helmet and pushed the squarer Hun
helmet down onto his head.  The spike on its top glinted in the early
morning sun. 

He could see the pterosaur now.  It was flying towards their lines
slowly and methodically. It was low, as the lieutenant had said, but
still too high to be hit with their Lee-Enfields - even if they had been
allowed to fire at it. Ground troops had learned from experience that
trying to shoot the flying lizards was a mistake. Pterodactyls were
trained to do two things.  Drop bombs on the enemy and then fly home and
they only had two ways of knowing when to drop their bombs: drop bombs
on flat helmets; drop bombs on people shooting up at them.  Drop bombs.
Go home.  It was all they were capable of learning. In the trench,
everyone hunkered down and tried to look as German as possible.  Someone
started to whistle "Lili Marlene".

"Shut that fucking noise, Watkins!" bellowed the sergeant.
They sat in silence waiting for the pterosaur to fly over.  The
silence, as always, was terrifying.

"Christ," muttered Tommy. "I hope it's not one of ours..."

[*BLURB] Concerning the workes of men, by the word of thy lips, I
haue kept me from the paths of the destroyer.<small> - Psalms 17:4 King
James Version (1611)</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">In other times, it would have been
described as 'an accident', or, more accurately, 'collateral damage',
'friendly fire', 'an unforeseen consequence of a training exercise'. The
Secretary General of the United Nations, once the Indonesian ambassador
to Chile, eventually caused his personal assistant to instruct a legal
clerk to draft an e-mail of protest to the commander of the Altairian
garrison - a dozen vast alien military spacecraft in orbit around the
Earth. In point of fact, the body count in the incident was minimal -
some fifteen domestic animals. Because the incident had happened at
night, and the usual inhabitants had been absent, no human had been
killed. There was, however, considerable property damage.

To do him credit, the Secretary General's comparative disinterest in the
incident understandably reflected his preoccupation with attempts to
organise a cease fire in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, a running
battle which had rumbled on for over a hundred years, since the 1940s,
and was currently generating three hundred or more casualties per day,
and, given the current population of the disputed area could probably
persist for four hundred more years before either side ran out of
combatants. The fact that the Secretary General took the time to read
the thirty-two page draft e-mail of protest to the Altairians was
remarkable, under the circumstances. 

He quickly reduced the size of the document to a couple of paragraphs,
the gist of which was 'Your spacecraft killed a number of livestock, and
caused much property damage at Mount Elysium in Scotland, doubtless by
accident. Compensation is sought. Details available on request'. The
resulting e-mail was sent to General 27-Fardik-Senti, CO of the orbiting
garrison.

<p class=drop>Some history: In the middle of the nineteenth century,
Albert McRaven,
on the death of his eccentric father, received a plot of land in
Scotland, the majority of the father's estate having gone,
appropriately, to Albert's elder brother, who had effectively been
managing the land for decades. 

Albert McRaven had left home young, and made a fortune from speculating
in mining. He had no need for this legacy, which consisted of the least
desirable portion of his deceased father's large estate. The land in
question was a precipitous triangle of wooded wasteland, unploughable,
filled with massive rocks ejected from the arable areas of the original
estate. Dry, scraggy conifers poked from the tumbled boulders at the
highest point.  A constant trickle of water oozed through the rocks and
supplied the bog and stream which occupied the southern boundary of the
area. 

At Albert's instigation, Mount Elysium was conceived as a sort of
full-sized folly and summer palace. The house and its environs were
created over ten years, carved from this irregular, rocky corner of
land, a site which originally resembled a landslide. Because of its
steepness, though it was just a dozen acres on a map, the actual surface
area of the plot was nearly half as much again. 

Albert entrusted the development of his inheritance, not to a
conventional architect, but to a talented Italian stage designer, Luigi
Manini, who had designed a number of remarkable palaces in Portugal.
Most old estates are the product of centuries of evolution, expansion
and modification. Albert's country seat was designed to look as if it
had been aeons in the making. Albert was so charmed by the result that
he eventually spent most of his time there. It was he who called the
place Mount Elysium.

Seen from afar, the house itself was a cluster of towers, steeples, and
sharply inclined tiled roofs above creamy stone masonry, pierced by
generous gothic windows. The whole was apparently chaotic, yet
harmonious. Set, as it was, on the sloping site, it featured many
levels, clinging to the rocks as though it had grown there. Seen closer
at hand, there was no feature of the edifice which lacked decoration.
Much of the stone was carved, every window embellished with flower and
tendril motifs. Coats of arms dominated every doorway. Colonnades
adorned attractive balconies. There were clerestories, crockets and
crenellations, gargoyles, sculptured chimneys, flying buttresses and
fluted gutters.

The interior was equally unrestrained. Heavy plasterwork and trompe
l'oeil ceiling art, fireplaces fit to roast an elephant in, some floors
featuring tiles by famous artists, some with wood-block in patterns from
Escher to jigsaw. Sculpture and oil paintings, in the best of taste,
were to be found throughout; furnishings likewise. The house was a
warren of twisting passages and curving staircases linking magnificent
rooms, vast halls, cosy studios and leather-lined libraries of ancient
and modern books.

The grounds were equally astonishing, paths and stairways curving among
manicured trees and hedges. There was a stable block built in a
miniature facsimile of the main house, a hermit's cave that had never
accommodated a hermit, summer houses, beehives, dovecotes, parapets and
bastions, numerous pools, floating duckhouses. Peacocks strutted and
hooted. Tame mountain goats inhabited the cliffs. At the very summit of
the grounds stood a circular colonnade in the style of a classical
temple. Within the circle, there started an astonishingly deep circular
shaft, eight metres in diameter, down which wound a spiral staircase
clinging to the wall of the shaft. At points on the staircase, tunnels
led away from the shaft, zigzagging to various places on the estate -
precipitous balconies with unique views, rooms in the main house
accessed by secret doors or fireplaces.  One such tunnel led to a dark,
three dimensional maze in which a casual explorer without a map would
certainly starve before finding the exit. From the bottom of the shaft,
a damp tunnel with streaming walls led to a echoing chamber behind a
waterfall. A set of stepping stones led cleverly out of the chamber,
avoiding the waterfall, crossing the main pond towards a set of steps
leading to the main house. 

Critics tended to dismiss Mount Elysium's beauty by referring to its
elaborately theatrical appearance, to the over-lush detail, to the
sensationalist novelties. The use of a set designer rather than an
architect was deplored, yet the buildings had stood for nearly two
hundred years. And no honest person who had actually visited Mount
Elysium ever had a word to say against it.

For the last fifteen years, Mount Elysium had become the headquarters of
the Elysium Foundation, an organisation which sought to glorify the
Works of Man. Mount Elysium itself was such a work, and the Foundation's
president, Major Roland Thoroughgood, frequently glorified it.
Incidentally, the Foundation spent much time vilifying the aliens who
had made the Earth into a provincial fort in their incomprehensible
conflict with certain other aliens, a conflict which had, mercifully,
not yet reached this outpost of the galaxy.

Roland Thoroughgood was a tall, erect man of some fifty years, a retired
soldier from the best regiment that remained of Scotland's once-proud
military tradition. Lean and active, a whisky drinker, and a patient fly
fisherman.

Most of the income of The Foundation had accrued from expensive,
exclusive, guided tours of Mount Elysium. Much of the expenditure
resulted from the property's upkeep. Now there was no property. The
Foundation could not survive for long.

It was, therefore, not surprising that Roland Thoroughgood regarded the
total destruction of Mount Elysium as a targeted strike by the Altairian
overlords against his centre of operations. He had been in London when
the catastrophe occurred, but, in a way, Roland would have preferred to
die with Mount Elysium rather than to contemplate the loss of one of the
greatest works of Man. 

Of the house and grounds, there remained nothing recognisable. The whole
area was a huge pile of blackened stones, each about the size of the
fist that Roland clenched as he almost tearfully regarded the ruin that
could never be restored. All gone. The walls and towers, the furniture,
paintings, books, woodwork and plasterwork, lost without trace. An
attempt by a local contractor to clear some of the charred debris, in
the expectation of discovering something of value beneath, had been
abandoned when it became clear that all these fist-sized lumps were
fused together in a single half-million ton cinder. Explosives would be
necessary if the site was to be cleared. The aliens should be held to
account and made to pay for this outrage. Roland's claim for
compensation was complicated by the fact that he resolutely refused a
simple money settlement based on the estimated price that the house
would have fetched on the open market. He demanded that the house and
land be restored to its previous condition.

<p class=drop>Despair threatened to overcome Roland in these first
months after the incident, because he could not see any way forward. His
claim appeared bogged down in UN bureaucracy. Every time he e-mailed the
United Nations International Trust in Phnom Penh, the reply came from a
different apparatchik with a different job title. All expressed
sympathy; none promised anything substantial, though it was common
knowledge that previous accidental damage and deaths caused by the
Altairians had resulted in generous financial recompense. Meanwhile,
nothing was happening. For weeks and weeks.

To establish a headquarters for the Elysium Foundation, Roland rented an
office in the nearby county town, most famous for its whisky distillery.
He then moved into the McRaven Arms Hotel a few kilometers down the
valley from Mt Elysium, and spent part of every day climbing around and
contemplating the wreckage, if a heap of slag could be called wreckage. 

To the barman at the McRaven Arms he said: "The problem is, Archie, that
re-creating Mount Elysium isn't just money. There is no way that we can
accurately reproduce it. The roof tiles, for example, are no longer
made. Some were specially made, and they had weathered, but, mainly,
it's time, it's site clearance, it's the availability of materials,
craftsmen. It will take years, longer than it took when it was
originally built, and it'll not be the same when it's done. People will
take short cuts. Compromises will have to be made."

"Surely, Major, the biggest difficulty will be getting the house
re-built exactly the same as it was. It was all very peculiar in shape,
was it not?"

"Happily, that will not be such a problem. Copies of the original
building plans are in the archives at the the Royal Scottish Society of
Architects. And there are many subsequent applications and modification
papers lodged in the County Council offices. No. It's the exact
configuration of the hill, the watercourses, the detailed design of
interior and exterior decoration. And no-one, these days, has the
stone-carving and relief plasterwork skills."

"But, Major, there always seemed to be some repairs in progress up at
the house. Perhaps a rebuild would be no bad thing."

"A rebuild? I begin to wonder if we should just take the money and buy
another property."

Ever since the destruction of Mount Elysium, Roland had found it easy to
slip into this mood of pessimism. It was now fifteen weeks since the
catastrophe, and two weeks since he had last heard anything official.
One evening, however, a courier arrived at the hotel with a large
packet. The packet contained five items: a covering letter from UNIT, a
sheet of instructions, a flat box with a British domestic plug wired to
it, a smaller box which plugged into the flat box, and a tiny crystal,
just a few millimeters  in size, which fitted into a socket in the
smaller box.

Hey, Major Roland,

At last, we have the go-ahead to fix up Mt. Elisyum (sic). 

General 27-Fardik-Senti, CIC Altairian Garrison Fleet, has checked out
the sad happening, and idenified one Captain Najak-Till-38 as Off. Proj.
Coordinator. The Gen. decided the error was quote a complete accident
that could have happened to anyone at the controls of an AOP
(Atmosphere-enabled Offensive Pinnace) in the midst of a battle training
exercise with live ammo unquote. Whatever, eh? So he's okayed the
facilities of the star fleet being at the disposal of his expert,
Najak-Till-38, to make good the damage.

The only condition is that you keep this Najak character in the loop.
Make no move without his approval. 

On the behalf of UNIT, I greenlight you to liaison with Najak-Till-38
and startup the rebuild ae-sap. Keep me emailed on progress. Please
shoot any invoices to me for payment.

All the Bestest<br> Hank Goldsboro, DIC Repairs, UNIT.</font> </span>
</div> The news was so good that Roland found himself able to suppress a
sneer at Hank Goldsboro's casual letter-writing style. He turned to the
next enclosure.

The sheet of instructions was clear enough. All the boxes had what
looked like warning labels on them in the weird Altairian script to
which
most of the population of Earth had become accustomed in photographs of
the alien vessels. Very few people, however, and only those with a flair
for arcane languages, were able to read the script. The aliens, by
contrast, seemed to have mastered the mechanics of written English,
though they appeared baffled by figures of speech, sarcasm, slang and
advertising-speak. Strangely, they appeared more at ease with Chinese.

The large flat box, it appeared, was a charger; the smaller box a power
supply for the crystal. The crystal was capable of operating
independently of its power supply for a period of time expressed in
Altairian time units, which Archie the barman, with the aid of a search
engine on his till, translated as thirteen and a half hours. The
instructions omitted to specify the purpose of the crystal.

Roland carried the devices to his room, and plugged them into the socket
that normally powered the bedlight. Nothing much happened, other than an
encouraging hum. There had been no developments by the time he went to
bed. At about three in the morning, a musical chime awoke him, and he
struggled up in the bed, giving a surprised shout as he perceived an
alien in the room. 

Aliens seldom appeared on Earth, as their preferred atmospheric
constituents, ambient operating temperature and gravity were far
different from terrestrial conditions. When they did descend to Earth in
person, it was always with the aid of an elaborate space suit. Roland's
Altairian lacked this apparatus, and he quickly realised that he was
seeing a telepresence - a hologram, in short. Now Roland knew what the
crystal was for.  And he was irritated.

Since the bedlight was disconnected in favour of the machine, Roland was
forced to get out of bed, dodging around the alien's image, though he
knew he could have walked right through it, and switched on the main
light.

"What?" asked Roland, lacking the wit at this time of night to express
himself more cogently. He had never seen an alien this close before. It
was roughly human in shape, but he was somewhat surprised at its bulbous
form, greyish skin colour and multi-faceted eyes.

The alien apparently took "What" as an invitation to converse, and after
a few seconds it started to speak. The time delay indicated that it was
speaking from an orbiting spacecraft. Altairian speech sounded like
whalesong, and was not readily comprehended by the average human.
However, an English translation began to appear in supertitles above the
alien's image, and, after another slight delay, a text-to-speech
transcript began to drone. Finding simultaneous whalesong and
mid-Atlantic drawl too much for his ears, Roland called "Mute!" and
concentrated on the supertitles.

<tt>"My name is Najak-Till-38. I am sorry for you and the peoples. I
take responsible for the accidental destruction of the home of mountain
elysium. And take responsible for new build of home. To explain the case
of a short. Soldier test a release button to broken when during a
simulation attack."</tt>

"Well, thank you for the apology, Najak. I am Major Roland Thoroughgood.
Now, how will you help me?" 

Evidently, the alien was getting a translation at the other end. Its
head cocked to one side in a very human manner, while its lid tentacles
licked across its eyes like a blink.

<tt>"Major. Greetings. Elysium outline specification prepared from
satellite stereo image. Please to rotate and confirm."</tt> An image - a
three dimensional image - of Mount Elysium replaced Najak in the
holo-projection. The colours were all wrong, the house and grounds,
ponds, streams, trees, bushes were presented as if all in one piece.
Clearly, the satellite image had been unable to see considerable chunks
of the house and environs, but the detail was astonishing. Magnifying
parts of the image with arm-stretches, Roland was able to see individual
roof tiles, guttering sections, flaking paint on window sills, puddles
on the terrace and even an individual peacock on a balustrade. 

Collapsing the view to an overall view again, Roland said, "Yes, this is
the house and garden that must be re-constructed. But how can you help
with this?"

<tt>"There must be exact specifications for a project."</tt>

"Surely we can start with the groundworks. We need to clear the site and
restore the contours."

A pause. <tt>"You are correct. Site clearance precedes construction. But
first, specifications"</tt>

Roland decided to take this as approval for site clearance. He'd get
things rolling in the morning.

"Look, Najak, this is a bad time of night for me. Can we talk tomorrow?"

<tt>"You prefer talk when you are under  eye of sun we recognise of
course. Altairian habit is opposite orientation."</tt> The hologram
blinked out abruptly.

Roland attempted sleep, but it eluded him. It appeared that
communication was likely to be a little stilted. However, it looked as
though matters were at last moving forward. 

<p class=drop>Roland spent part of the morning contacting Norsk
Diamantbor, the
Norwegian site clearance experts he had lined up to clear the lava-like
crust with explosives and heavy equipment. Due to prior commitments and
logistics, it would be a few weeks before they could be on site, but at
least it was a start.

Then he drove to his one-room office near the library. A few seconds
after he placed the Altairian crystal on its mounting, Najak-Till-38
appeared, picking up the conversation without any greeting, as if there
had been no interval.

<tt>"Using public photo image, detail improved. Specifications of
materials necessary. Also lacunae to be filled. Please browse."</tt>

A new image of the house and grounds appeared. Now, nearly all of the
external geography appeared to be in place. The hologram was
unbelievably solid. As Roland gestured his way around Elysium, it seemed
almost real. Apparently, the aliens had mined the entire internet for
images taken by visitors, and patched them together with great skill. He
was temporarily lost for words, and slightly tearful for several
minutes.

Najak-Till-38 broke the silence: <tt>"Specifications of materials
necessary. Also lacunae to be filled."</tt>

"Yes, of course. This will make builders' plans much easier to draw up.
Well done... Najak, is it?"

<tt>"My name is Najak-Till-38. Specifications of materials necessary.
Also lacunae to be filled."</tt>

"What if I walk around the simulation and point to materials and tell
you what they are? And I can help with the missing bits."

<tt>"Yes. I am recording now. Please begin with environment."</tt> 

"The grounds, you mean?"

<tt>"Nature and positioning of water courses, shafts and tunnels is
necessary. These details lacking from satellite imagery. Important for
positioning of structures."</tt>

"Of course," said Roland, doubtfully.

<tt>"Nature and composition of building materials, rocks and soil
already projected from samples of adjacent unaffected buildings and
terrain. Also please distinguish between dead and living matter."</tt>

"Of course. OK." Roland was, he found, rather pleased to wander around
this virtual Mount Elysium, indicating the course of the maze of
tunnels, identifying where masonry supplemented the natural rock. The
many follies and caves were straightforward. Photographs existed of
these, and they had already been incorporated into the model. 

One of the caves was lined with sea shells cemented to the rock. Roland
had often noted a number of patterns among the random distribution of
shells. These patterns were reproduced faithfullly. This cave gave rise
to the first of many tricky discussions. Were the shells alive or dead?
Dead, but created by living creatures. Of what were they composed?
Calcium carbonate, Roland believed. Surely they were tougher than chalk?
While Roland pondered this problem, Najak-Till-38 answered it from some
database. It appeared that seashells were, indeed, basically chalk, but
bonded in a crystalline structure with use of certain animal proteins.
Who knew?

<tt>"In the event that exact matching shells cannot be found, may we
propose the use of individual artificial shells made of porcelain, which
has similar texture and strength?" </tt>

"Seems reasonable."

Wood was another debating point, particularly where twisted pieces of
natural wood had been used in construction. Eventually, Roland was
forced to concede that timber could be substituted with moulded
Lignoloid or similar strong durable plastic composite in the exact shape
of the original. It had to look and feel like wood, but, after all, it
would be less subject to warp, woodworm and wet rot, the three Ws which
were the bane of ancient buildings' existence.

When Roland began to feel exhaustion, he realised he had been
figuratively trudging around the simulation for nine hours, and still he
had not dealt with the truncated tunnels, the walls and the ceilings of
chambers within the subterranean maze, most of which lacked photographic
evidence or identification of location. Sometimes, even he had been
defeated by the plethora of photographs. Often, he relied on the
timestamp of images to make a logical decision. It was like a huge
jigsaw, and Roland only realised the detail at which he and
Najak-Till-38 had been working when they stopped.

<div class=halfcenter><img  src="elysium3.jpg"></div>

Day followed day as the details were clarified. Much confusion arose
when the official plans at the Institute of Architecture differed from
the actuality as it had been. Najak-Till-38 had understandable
difficulty distinguishing buildings, fixtures and fittings like shelves,
racks and bathroom items from trees, bushes, furniture, books, utensils,
clothes, domestic animals, and carpets. An inventory of these movable
items was built up, items which could, for the most part, be obtained in
antique shops, auction rooms and antiquarian bookstores, and would be
purchased when construction was complete.

The specification seemed endless. Communication with Najak-Till-38 was
fine, as long as Roland kept providing data, but there was no small talk
between them. When Roland was tired, Najak-Till-38 would sign off
without demur. When Roland occasionally asked about the next stage of
the project, or timescales for reconstruction, the invariable answers
were either: <UL><li><tt>"Printing cannot take place until specification
is complete."</tt><br> or  <li><tt>"Site clearance is the first stage of
rebuild."</tt></ul> neither of which really advanced his state of
knowledge, except that, presumably, printed plans would be available
when the site was cleared.

As the process of specification drew to a close, Roland became more and
more conscious of the complexity of the rebuild. The groundworks alone
would surely take an army of workers months, even years, to perfect.

As for the house, the availability of craftsmen would be a problem.
Roland was impatient to make a practical start of some kind. He feared
he would not live to see the completion of the project. However,
Najak-Till-38 was adamant that the model be complete in every detail,
and it was true that the site clearance contractor had made
disappointing progress against the lava field that had been Mount
Elysium. They had drilled through into one of the underground passages
that led from the house to the enormous shaft, but it was half full of
lava, still hot months after the incident. Their completion estimates
were dropping into the following year.

<div class=halfcenter><img  src="elysium2.jpg" > </div>

In the meantime, a small warehouse had been rented in Edinburgh, and a
firm of auctioneers, paid for by UNIT, started to purchase replacement
furniture and books as near as possible to the original contents of the
house. They were making satisfactory progress.

Roland later calculated that the specification process with
Najak-Till-38 had taken over 800 hours, spread over 15 weeks.  It was
intensive work, and the model around which he had 'walked' day after day
was more familiar to him than the the original estate had ever been.
And, indeed, the model was much cleaner than the real thing had been,
and flaws and cracks and peeling paint were non-existent on the model.
His time with Najak-Till-38 had eventually become a ritual, and he had
even taken to turning up the audio so that he could hear the alien's
weird sounds, though he never could make anything of the language, and
Najak-Till-38 still showed no sign of affection or familiarity with him.

So, though it was a relief to come to the end of the intensive work,
within a day, he was missing it. And then, as days passed, and the
expected architectural plans didn't appear, and Najak-Till-38 never
responded when Roland activated the hologram device, he began to worry.
The model could still be seen and explored through the crystal, but he
could make no contact with the alien.

Finally, a telephone call from Norsk Diamantbor rang alarm
bells. Apparently, they had been ordered off the site, paid for progress
to date, but sent home to Oslo. They wanted to know why. Roland could
not enlighten them. He drove up to the site, but was stopped five
kilometers short at a roadblock manned by UN troops. They knew nothing
other than that the area was sealed off. Roland drove forty kilometers
up the coast and tried to approach Mount Elysium from the north. Same
result, except that the troops there reported that an alien vehicle had
flown over their position recently, heading south.

<p class=drop>It was fortunate that the day was clear and bright, and
more fortunate still that someone had reported the alien atmosphere
craft to the media. Half a dozen TV heliplatforms and BBC's
side-pointing satellite camera were focused on Mount Elysium. The
footage is remarkable. An unbelievably large vessel hovers over the
area, black, with yellow and red markings and insignia. Silvery beams
twinkle below it. A slice of the mountain, including all the slag from
the accident, is hoisted out, a bite from the landscape, leaving a
perfectly smooth surface, somewhat circular in cross section. A
million tons or more are suspended below the craft. The action is nearly
silent, the ship making only a gentle hum. This vessel accelerates away
vertically, and soon disappears into the stratosphere.

A second space vehicle appears, even larger, a flat disc with legs a
kilometre in length. Its size is only apparent when it reaches the site.
It must be two kilometers in diameter. It appears to hover over the scar
in the hillside, but it never actually touches the ground, as later
inspection shows absolutely no trace of pressure from the massive feet.
The legs extend and retract to match the terrain, and it spends some
time adjusting its position a little this way and that, until it is
centred over the hole and absolutely horizontal.

Then, the most remarkable thing of all, dark threads spring down from
the base of the craft, whipping back and forth at immense speed, and
gradually a shape emerges from the the pit. At first, only a few
amorphous lumps are visible, but then vertical structures appear,
building up and up, until the creamy-walled gatehouse is revealed,
followed by the lower levels of the main house. The rocks above the
lowest pond flutter into existence. The tv commentator is heard to
mutter, "My God, it's a massive 3D printer."

The entire broadcast lasts about 190 minutes, at the end of which Mount
Elysium can be seen resplendent in its elegant perfection, a miracle of
architecture reproduced by a miracle of technology. Water runs, ponds
start to fill. The landscape is still rather bare, but it's all there.

<p class=drop>Major Roland Thoroughgood was restored to Mount Elysium
within days. For a while he was occupied in checking the obvious errors,
including a non-closing door, a hidden utility room that had never
appeared on the holographic model because it had never been
photographed, and some strange plumbing which resulted in puffs of
boiling water issuing from an overflow pipe into a courtyard. A whole
oak tree, which Roland had failed to report as 'living' had been
re-created in detail, its branches and leaves frozen into a stiff
sculpture of a tree. All the errors were his, he concluded, on comparing
actuality with the model. The auctioneers in Edinburgh began to bring
the furniture, rugs and books they had obtained. Gardeners were employed
to obtain and plant trees and bushes. Fish, peacocks and goats were
bought. It actually took longer to fit the house and grounds out again
than it had taken to specify and build the landscape and structure.

But at the end of the day, Major Roland Thoroughgood was discontent. The
place smelled a little plasticky - long chain monomers, probably. The
stone felt lighter than stone, the wood harder than wood, the supposedly
porcelain seashells were strangely flexible.	And, above all, Mount
Elysium no longer truly represented the Works of Man at all. Within a
few months, Roland had sold Mount Elysium, and moved the Foundation to
the Ferdinand Cheval Palace, which had just come up for sale. It was his
belief that the French appreciated The Works of Man more than any other
nation.

[*BLURB] The Singularity may be approaching, but it can't happen all by itself.
Someone is going to have to lead us to it by the hand...
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">It began with only myself and an idea.
Pen, paper and dream. I planned it all as best I could, then brought in
a friend with the practical know-how to push it through to patent. By
the time we were legal I had a three man team, building by hand in my
garage while I scrounged money and materials everywhere I could think to
look. My girlfriend did the books and was my wife when the bank signed
off on the loan. My staff of twelve formed an honour guard, my patent
buddy was best man.

The world loves a good acronym, so we called them the Advanced Synthetic
Industrial Machine Operator (model 5)--or the ASIMO-V for short. We
couldn't build them fast enough. One year later we hired this factory,
next year we bought it. The first new hand on the floor only had three
fingers--great photo-op. Ten years later I'm pulling the plug. No
choice, I'm afraid.

No choice. 

I'm afraid.

It started with a weekend watchman, signing in and dropping off the
radar. Insurance bit down for "leaving premises unsecured". With shadows
in his past we didn't chase him too hard. Just hiked the prices a shade
to cover the new premium and chalked it off to experience.

Then we began losing staff. Night shift workers first, clocking in, then
sneaking out and not returning. Or so I thought. When we looked, we
found they'd left their lives too. Unanswered phone calls, unanswered
letters. Flyers stuffing letter-slots, curtains that didn't get drawn or
opened. A pet dog barking weakly behind a frosted glass door. 

We put in another demonstration model to take up the slack, half to fill
the gaps and half as a publicity measure. Temporarily to begin with,
until we saw no reason not to let it stick. The existing staff made the
usual jokes, same ones you'd heard on the news, but what's two against
thousands? Nothing at all, nothing to worry about. But more guys dropped
out, gals too. Soon it's more than a couple of demo-mods hanging about,
it's a dozen. Suddenly the guys and gals aren't joking so genuine.

Five thousand workers wanted a union. I'd been there, I was okay with
it. Four meetings in, their rep doesn't show. Not the first to go
missing in the nine-to-five by now, far from it. Rumours were whispered
on the shop floor, which is to say shouted over the deafening noise. I
was worried, but the boardroom wouldn't hear it. I talked about worker
moral, they talked about Columbian knock offs, out-performing us on
Turing and under-cutting us on price. And more staff abandoned us. Not
to mention their entire lives.

I talked to a friendly policeman about my concerns, one specialising in
industrial sabotage. He said he'd look into it on the quiet, but never
got back. When I called his desk, the voice on the other end had
questions that made me hang up fast. Next day his face was in the media,
wife, children and senior officers appealing for any information, in
particular his last known location, recent contacts. I was glad I'd
called from the road, from a bar, and made a point of forgetting its
name. His too.

Come last year it wasn't just disappearances, we had good old fashioned
resignations too--but some familiar names showed up in Columbia, then
two Indian start-ups mysteriously hit the ground running and our Legal
Department soon had us fighting patent battles on three fronts. With
models making up twenty percent of the workforce and original staff
still vacating their posts and homes without warning, more of the eighty
percent were absconding voluntarily, and taking tall stories with them.
We were big enough that the media wouldn't touch them for the
incredulity value, but every penny saved by a twenty-four-hour-a-day
replacement was as quickly swallowed by the court costs. 

Almost overnight our third-world workforce rivals were saturating the
market, selling units at half what we needed to meet our overheads, and
we had to start laying people off before they could jump just to keep
the god-damned thieves in sight. Turn of this year we were up to seventy
percent artificial, and still the human thirty dwindled, by fair means
or foul. Now the claims coming from a vocal minority of our former
workforce--those that could actually be found to ask questions
of--started showing up in blogs and tabloids. When they hit the
mainstream, it'd finally hit the fan.

Four months ago my buddy hit on a new patent. Three months ago my wife
hit on him. Two months ago they both sold their shares to the bigger of
my Indian competitors, and one month ago the rest of my board jumped
ship too. My precious point-oh-one percent keeps the ball in my court
for now, but, you know: damn it. They want to call time on the legal
actions, the Indian ones anyway, cut our losses and move on. Move on to
a buyout, naturally. I'm not made of money. Not much I can do at this
point, really.

Not much legitimate, anyway.

Nothing to stop me spannering their works a little though.

Just now I dropped a couple of minor bombshells on the world via email.
When those in the know put two and two together, I doubt our share price
will recover in a hurry. The implication for the pickpockets isn't too
attractive either. I wonder if they have had as much tidying up to do as
we did.

I do feel for what's left of the staff--the breathing ones anyway.
That's why I'm laying off anything with a pulse rather than a current.
Golden handshakes for those with five fingers. 

It was a mistake, I guess. Mine first, but now it's everyone's. All
that's left for me is a long, silent walk around the automated roar of
the midnight floor, to the generator room. Flip the master switches,
lock the factory on my way out and do a disappearing act of my own.

Except, when I get there, the door won't open.

And behind me the machines all stop what they're doing.

[*BLURB] Déjà vu is just reincarnation for beginners
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I slid onto the bar stool alongside J.J.
Bones and dropped my fedora on the counter.  The surrounding patrons of
Café Crank suddenly found an excuse to give us some room. J.J. had a
reputation for violence, not that 'violence' came close to describing
what he was capable of.

He didn't look up from his drink. "That's my friend's face you're
wearing. Either leave now or leave it behind later."

I motioned to the barman but he pretended not to see me, talking great
interest in polishing a glass instead. "That's no way to greet an old
pal, J-J, especially someone you shot in the face last time out."

His eyes flickered in my direction. "Like I should know what you're
talking about? In your next life try a different approach." J.J. tossed
back his drink and stood up, arms hanging loosely at his sides. The
other customers collectively cringed, and none of them were exactly
blushing violets. The barman set the glass down on the counter and
reached for his shotgun - a sub-sonic Sandbagger. Not to use on J.J. -
he had more sense - but to take me out before things turned really
nasty. 

I dropped my voice. "That scar on your tongue, courtesy of Brakiri
Dreams."  Only four people knew what had happened outside the nightclub;
me (in a previous incarnation), J.J. and the two McMaster sisters - both
of whom had been remaindered shortly thereafter.

J.J. stared at me. "Rudi? That really you?"

"In the flesh, my man, and I mean that literally. A mirror image of my
past self, if you like." 

He sat down again and waved the barman over. "Two Jack D, straight up."
Tension in the room dropped a notch and conversation around us
restarted, if a tad louder than before.  J.J. looked me up and down.
"Mirror image? You're talking crystal lattice neural net in a vat-grown
body?"

I grinned. "You got it. The second-best that Chiba City can provide."

"Expensive." He sipped his drink. "And then some."

"And money, J-J, is what I'm here to discuss." I tried my drink and
shuddered at the unfamiliar sensation. Originally I'd been an organic
brain in a synthetic body, but had to make other arrangements after J.J.
blew my head off. "My last client lodged a fortune in escrow with
several black clinics, knowing I wasn't going to collect. Despite my
trusting nature I tapped some of it for a real-time uplink, live and
direct. The memory of being killed is pretty weird, let me tell you."

"And, again, expensive. So you had to settle for a lattice rather than
engram recreation?"

"Yup. Close, but no cigar. I'm now as human as they come, apart from
where it counts." J.J. was entirely organic, with the BioPurity live-ink
tattoo on his shoulder to prove it, whereas with my artificial mind I
was still a cyborg. 

He sipped his drink. "It was nothing personal." Which was as close to an
apology as I was going to get. "You mentioned money?"

I nodded. "Uh-huh. The babe who hired me knows her money is gone. The
Chiba City boys were more than happy to drain the escrow accounts and
put it into circulation, for a percentage, but that leaves me with a big
target on my back."

J.J. grinned. "And you're walking around with the same name, the same
face? Gutsy."

"I figured she'd come after me regardless, so why not stick with what I
know? Anyway, I've got the goods on her and its bound to be worth big
bucks."

"So, we're talking straight-up blackmail?"

"Primo. The babe claimed to be a personality construct based on Rosa
Hartz, a former exec with mediaCore. That may even be true, but it
doesn't really matter. This is all about boardroom control, and that
means moula. I figure we can back-track Rosa and find out who's running
her."

He grunted. "If it was me she'd be body parts by now."

"True, true, but not everyone is as tidy as you, J-J. Plus I don't think
she's told anyone I'm back from the dead. Rosa thought she was subject
to psychological imperatives, but loyalty doesn't make you dumb. I get
the distinct impression that with her crew it's one strike and you're
out."

"OK, so she wants you snuffed but has to do it on the quiet. That maybe
bought some time, but coming back here just burned you, and good."

I smiled. "Which is why I have a car outside, and an address to case. You in?"

"Depends. How much you figure we can take Rosa for?"

"Given what she's been able to do so far, and what it must have cost,
I'd say an easy fifteen million."

J.J. finished his drink and set the glass down, inverted, on the bar.
"Fifteen million dollars is not money. It's a motive with a universal
adaptor on it."

We rolled.
<div class= halfcenter><img src="truth2.jpg"></div>
<p class=drop>My car was a rental; an unlicensed Brazilian copy of a
retro BMW 7-Series fitted with a standard hydrogen cell. Given how
Munich was this big hole in the ground I didn't think they'd mind. I
drove while J.J. put together a semi-automatic pistol from the seemingly
innocuous contents of his pockets; a lighter, a cigarette case, a pen -
shit like that.

I glanced over. "They do come already assembled, so I'm told."

He paused to scratch his chin. "I'm trying this out for a client. Says
he saw it in some old film and wants ready access to a firearm that can
pass a full security inspection. If the man is willing to pay then who
am I to argue?" 

"Speaking of esoteric weaponry, J-J, you owe me a needle gun."

"I do?"

"You do. All bought and paid for. And don't give me no legal bullshit
about how I'm not really the same person, right?"

J.J. smiled. "Well, if you can spare the time, make a stop at the
StreetSafe on Inkerman. Couldn't shift the damn thing, anyway."

I kept the engine hot while J.J. punched in his code and waited for the
internal carousel to present his safety deposit box at the access slot.
There were two Byrons at the transit stop who might have
complicated matters, but they only operate in threes - mad, bad and
dangerous to know. Their third wheel was obviously running late.

J.J. returned to the car and tossed the needle gun into my lap.
"Twenty-six rounds remaining. I used four to crucify a rabbit so the
kid's dad would pay up." I winced, involuntarily, which provoked a harsh
laugh. "This new body making you soft, Rudi? That will be the endocrine
system interface acting up. You best watch that. But don't wet yourself,
it was a bunny-rabbit, a soft toy. Made the kid scream herself blue in
the face though." 

I stashed the gun in my jacket pocket and pulled away from the kerb.
"Anything you wouldn't do, J-J? I ask purely for information."

"Depends."

"On?"

"On how much you're willing to pay, or how badly you piss me off. You
looking for a resumé?" 

"I'll pass. It's just that if Rosa turns out to be small-fry then we'll
need to move on up the food chain to make this worth our while. That
means getting a name outta' her."

He shrugged. "Easy enough. This dame, she's a looker?"

"Oh, yeah."

"Then you go for the face. Her body may be a replaceable meat-job, like
yours, but the mind finds it hard to ignore the threat of disfigurement.
Shit, I ain't brought a blade, though. Got a shiv about your person,
Rudi?"

"Swiss Army knife any good?"

J.J. snorted. "Kinda' lacking in threat factor, no? Never mind, there's
bound to be a bottle or glass we can use. Don't sweat it."

We drove on. A roving ad-ap hacked the car's multi-media system, which
burst into life. "<i>Welcome to the historic Foundry district. With its
post-industrial, neo-brutalist charm, Foundry makes the ideal-</i>". I
tried to switch it off but the ad had a lock on the traffic information
override. J.J. tore the console free and tossed it on the back seat.
Neither of us said a word.

After a few blocks I turned onto Smelter, making it obvious where we
were headed. J.J. Frowned. "Club Eighty-Eighty? You didn't tell me Rosa
was a gun-bunny. Either that or she's moonlighting as a working girl or
waitress." Club Eighty-Eight - 'An authentic experience of the
Reagan-Bush era' was a combined shooting range, diner and whorehouse. Of
course J.J. held a life-time membership.

I shook my head. "Neither, she's rented the entire top floor, the
function suite, on a long-term contract."

"Don't take this the wrong way, Rudi, but if someone like you managed to
trace her here, that's sloppy security, amateurish. You sure this babe
is the real deal?" 

I ignored the jibe. "When I went back to my office and checked the
surveillance logs there was no sign she'd ever been there. Same with the
building elevator, and she's got a real good memory for faces."

J.J. shrugged. "So you got hacked."

"So I got hacked, but because the building ice is so shit I keep a pair
of net aps running a continual Fred-and-Ginger around the site. Sure
enough, when I checked <i>that</i> log there was nothing there, but a
'nothing' that stopped my aps tracking each other."

He frowned. "Stealth programming? Absorption matrix? You're talking
about something from the high cores - military, or as good as.
<i>Please</i> tell me you didn't try and tag its ass?"

"I'm not that dumb, but I did get an approach vector, and it didn't come
from anywhere above the line. So I had Fred-and-Ginger back-track,
looking for what wasn't there. Club Eight-Eight has this pissy little
data net handling their membership, inventory and the like, but
squatting inside it is this <i>real</i> big lump of nothing."

"A camouflaged net access point. Who is it we're tweaking again? Because
this deal is going south by the minute."

"Originally I thought it had to be Margo Squires, but this really isn't
her style. She's all about boardroom leverage and this crew are
<i>way</i> outside the box."

I'd started out as a pleasure model, with Margo as one of my regular
clients. She'd been ousted as Chairman and CEO of mediaCore by Leon
Fabricant, the man I'd inadvertently assassinated. Margo might have been
a ruthless, manipulative, conniving bitch, but the closest she'd ever
come to corporate violence was a paper cut.

I parked the car. Even through the sound-proofing we could hear the
faint pop of small arms and occasional rattle of a machine-pistol. A
neon Ronald Reagan and George Bush towered above the entrance, arms
around each other's shoulders. Reagan winked while Bush gave us the
thumbs-up. 

We got out and walked over. The two doormen were slabs of meat wearing
dinner suits cut from ballistic cloth. I doubted they needed the
protection. With their cartilage enhancements and muscle grafts they
were probably proof against anything short of an anti-tank round.

J.J. flashed his membership. "This here is Rudi, my guest for the
evening. Who's in tonight, boys?"

One of the monoliths spoke - a squeaky falsetto. "The Skorpions and
Uzis, boss. So you maybe want to give the range a few minutes, yeah?"
Out back the club sported a stylized urban trial course, complete with
pop-up targets. It was also used by weapon-fetish gangs as a place to
settle old scores.

My host nodded. "I was feeling hungry anyway. Maybe we'll rent some time
on the fifty-cal later, Rudi?"

I managed an unconvincing grin. "Hell, yeah." 

We moved through to the diner and settled into a corner booth. The
waitress brought two schooners of beer over, unbidden. I looked around.
"No menus?"

He smiled. "Here they serve steak, with all the trimmings. Don't ask for
well-done or the cook will spit on it. If you're under the age of
twelve, or have a doctor's note, they might let you off with a burger."

"Look, J-J, I'm still getting a handle on this whole eating malarkey.
Don't they have a fish option?"

"Fish? Christ, man, that's no better than being a vegetarian. Well, if
you want everyone to know you're a card-carrying pinko liberal commie
fag, be my guest. Just give me a ten-minute head start, OK?"

"Yeah, yeah, I get the message." I sighed. "You actually like it here?"

J.J. grinned, a savage glint in his eye. "You bust a few caps to get the
blood flowing, party with the girls upstairs, then recover with an
overdose of red meat. What's not to like?"

"Sitting here with a target on my forehead? You may have forgotten but
this is kinda' the lion's den for me, so I'd appreciate tackling why we
really came here."

"No problem." He held up two fingers and the waitress delivered two shot
glasses of bourbon. "Depth charges. It's an acceptable form of Dutch
courage before taking on some of the heavier guns available for hire.
The club is actually named after the largest caliber they'll supply."

"That's a joke, right?"

"Usually. OK, access to the conference suite is via the main lobby, but
that's way too obvious given the lobby security. So we drink up, hit the
john, carry on out back and try the fire escape."

I stared at him. "Charging up the stairs and and kicking the door in,
that's your plan?"

"Pretty much. What it lacks in novelty, subtlety and the element of
surprise it makes up for in brutality. Look, Rosa is the only person
upstairs, and she's there right now?"

"Oh yeah. I've got a micro-drone across the parking lot, with a long
shot of the lobby stairs, plus another covering the rear. She comes and
goes quite frequently, and has a mania for changing her outfits like
four times a day, but she's the only person I've seen accessing the
conference suite."

J.J. smiled, but without humour. "So it don't matter if she has CCTV
coverage, motion sensors, the works - once we're in we move quickly to
find and overpower her. We're two grown men against one broad, so what
could possibly go wrong?"

"She might be armed, for starters."

"And we're still two against one. Trust me, up against those kinds of
odds most people want to believe you're only there to talk." He dropped
a shot glass into his beer. "So drink up and let's get this done."

I followed suit, raising the schooner to my lips and swallowing,
swallowing, swallowing until it was empty and I could reveal the shot
glass held between my teeth. Even diluted, the bourbon left a trail of
fire down my throat. I set both glasses on the table and tried not to
cough. J.J. was already on his feet, heading for the Men's Room. I threw
down some bills and followed suit, my eyes watering. 

At the far end of the corridor, past the rest rooms, lay the fire exit.
J.J. put a round into the door sensor before shouldering it open, not
that I thought anyone would give a damn. He raced up the external fire
escape, two treads at a time, with me hustling to keep up. On reaching
the top landing I barely had time to draw my needle gun before he blew
the door off its hinges with two micro-strip charges. 

We charged inside. I registered a short hallway ending in a T-junction
with doors on either side. 

Rosa Hartz appeared round the corner like a pop-up target on the range,
holding a semi-automatic pistol in each hand. She shot me once in the
chest by way of re-introduction before turning her fire on J.J. The pain
was like a spike between the ribs. I gasped and staggered - before
remembering to shut down the neural sensation interface.

But it was too late. Rosa blazed away at my partner, hitting him
multiple times in the torso. J.J. jerked and twitched under the impacts,
blood blossoming on his sleeveless jacket, but refused to fall.

I fired, the <i>twee-twee-twee</i> of the gas-powered weapon almost
inaudible against the background barrage. My aim was off and I hit Rosa
in the leg - I may not have been feeling any pain but my all-too-human
body was still coping with being shot in the chest. 

One needle shattered her kneecap and her leg gave way. Rosa slumped
sideways against the wall, wild rounds taking out the ceiling light and
glass panel door to our left. J.J. raised his composite pistol and shot
her cleanly through the right eye.

Silence.

Rosa Hartz collapsed to the floor like the proverbial puppet with its
strings cut.

J.J. Bones dropped to his knees, gun trailing on the carpet tiles.

I tried to speak but it came out as a frothy wheeze, pink-tinged bubbles
bursting on my lips.

J.J. groaned between clenched teeth. Bullets, spent rounds, began
dropping from his chest to the floor with a soft <i>plink</i>. I groped
a handkerchief from my pocket and pressed it against the sucking chest
wound. "See if you're not dead, J-J, I'm having you in front of the
Humanities Board. No<i> fucking</i> way could a regular body take shit
like that."

He swore under his breath and slowly stood up, one hand braced against
the wall for support. I didn't offer to help. J.J. took a breath and
winced. "Straub harness. Elasticated. Retards penetration, expels the
round. Chemical cauterization of the wound tract. Still hurts like fuck
though. Cost me a couple of ribs at least, maybe some internal damage,
but I'm good to go."

"Go? Go where? We just wasted our only lead. Anytime now, security will
come investigate our little firefight and may not take kindly to us
blowing away a paying client."

"Wanna get out now? Wanna quit? This is never gonna come your way again.
I say we check out her operation for clues and find out who she was
fronting for. You know, Rudi, like what a real private detective would
do?"

I snarled through my teeth by way of reply, a combination of frustration
and shame, and set off down the corridor. Rosa looked like an expensive
rag doll, discarded by some easily-bored child - which was almost the
case, given she'd been killed by J.J. Bones. I pocketed the needle gun
and prized the two conventional pistols from her grasp. I kept one and
handed the other to my partner. 

Around the corner, from where Rosa had appeared, was another length of
corridor. One of the doors stood ajar and there was light coming from
the room beyond. J.J. gave me a 'three-two-one' finger countdown and we
burst in.

A young man sat behind the desk across the room, facing the door. Two
illumination orbs hovered either side of him as he tapped on a Workpad.
Other than that the room was devoid of interest.

"I know this is a cliché but hands where we can see them, no sudden
moves." I sounded semi-apologetic, even to myself.

The man looked up, arching an eyebrow. "Do you seriously think I'd go to
all the time and expense of creating Rosa and bother to arm myself?" He
sighed and placed his Workpad on the desk in front of him before raising
his hands. "I take it she <i>is</i> dead?"

J.J. grinned. "Very, and you'll be joining her shortly if we don't get
some answers. Who you are, for starters."

"Who am I? Now that <i>is</i> an interesting question. Well, this body
is that of Simon McNeil, the new personal assistant to Margo Scales."

I frowned. "The body of Simon McNeil? Care to make some sense outta'
that, pal?"

'McNeil' smiled. "My mind is that of Howard Ghent, Chairman and CEO of
mediaCore until my - his - recent demise. McNeil was kind enough to
donate his body so that I can again exercise control over the
multi-media empire I founded. Not that Margo will recognize my influence
as anything so blatant."

My partner laughed, winced, and went <i>plink</i>. "Donate? Somehow I
doubt that. Mind jacking will get you remaindered, Ghent, regardless of
what financial and political influence you have. That's assuming the
Turing Bureau don't roast you alive first."

The neo-Ghent inclined his head. "One possible outcome, I admit, but in
the short term would you be interested in replacing Rosa as my personal
security? I'm sure you'll find the terms and conditions quite generous."

I shook my head. "Forget it, bozo, not reporting your crime comes with
a-"

The world went white.
<div class= halfcenter><img src="truth2.jpg"></div>

<p class=drop>My senses returned like an antique TV being tuned into a
station; sliding from static into coherence. I was lying on my side,
still in the office, with J.J. on the floor nearby and 'Ghent' again
typing on his Workpad.

Rosa Hartz stood in the doorway, holding a gun. 

The weapons we'd taken from her earlier, and the composite pistol, lay
on top of a filing cabinet. I tried to speak but could only wheeze and
bubble, having lost my handkerchief.

Ghent looked up. "Ah, Mister Hess, you've returned to us. On scanning
for weapons we discovered you're not quite as human as expected. Not
many of your kind survive the effects of a neural disruptor, so you
could almost count yourself fortunate."

J.J. groaned and raised himself up on one elbow. He blinked rapidly,
took in the room, and grinned at Rosa. "Marry me. Any bitch who can take
that kind of punishment deserves to be the mother of my child."

Rosa laughed. "I'm Rosamund Beatrice Hartz. The woman you killed was
Rosamund Deborah. Sorry to disappoint you, Bones."

Ghent smiled. "Why go to all the time and expense of procuring one
vat-grown bodyguard when you can have four at only eight times the
price? Duplicating the same personality becomes ruinously expensive, but
well worth it given the circumstances, I think you'll agree.  Deborah
will be missed, of course, although I'm never sure which one I'm dealing
with anyway."

Now that I was paying attention it was obvious her outfit was different
from the woman in the corridor, although the real giveaway was having
both eyes. I felt like a fool - they'd been coming and going in plain
sight all this time and I'd thought Rosa Hartz was simply a
fashion-conscious clothes horse. 

J.J. didn't seem discouraged. "The offer still stands. If you've got the
same moves as your sister then you're someone I'd want covering my back
any day of the week."

She smiled. "I'm almost flattered. The key word being 'almost'."

Ghent sounded irritated. "Enough of this. Please understand that you've
been kept alive for the sole purpose of providing me with information. I
need to know how you traced Rosa here and who else is involved. You have
my apologies in advance, Mister Bones, should you be unable to furnish
us with the technical aspects of your investigation, but I'm afraid
we're not going to take 'I don't know' for an answer."

My partner snorted. "Then put Hess under the hammer, not me. I'm just
the hired muscle."

"Unfortunately, Mister Hess, being the type of cyborg that he is, can
simply choose not to experience pain. So he's superfluous for the
purposes of this interrogation. " I felt myself relax at Ghent's words,
if only slightly. " Rosa, if you would be so kind as to kill Mister
Hess?"

I tried to speak as Rosa raised her weapon - and shot Ghent in the
heart.

He slumped back in his chair, coughed, and smiled. "Bravo." His head
fell forward.

I looked at J.J. We both looked at Rosa. She shrugged. "Same plan,
different players. I'll be the new advisor to Margo Scales, keeping tabs
until she can be ousted from the board. Howard really should have looked
more closely into where I- we - came from, but like all egotistical men
he assumed loyalty was a commodity with market value."

J.J. sat up and scratched his chest. He went <i>plink</i>. "OK, so
you've an agenda that doesn't involve Ghent, and that's cool. Now, with
him gone that's the end of the money trail as far as we're concerned, so
how about we call this a score-draw and leave it at that? Unless you'd
be interested in dinner?"

She laughed and shook her head. "Like I said, same plan, different
players. I still need to know how you traced us here, and Hess is still
surplus to requirements. Sorry, you might even be fun to have around,
but this is business."

I managed to speak. "Handkerchief. Pocket."

Rosa looked at me quizzically. "Famous last words? Oh, go on then, why
not. Given what you've cost us we may as well get our money's worth."

I fumbled in my pocket, hand closing over the needle gun. The plastic
and ceramic piece that didn't show up on a weapons scanner. 

I fired at Rosa, needles busting from my coat pocket and spraying her
face - more through luck than judgment. She screamed and shot back at
me, the bullet blasting simulated wood paneling from a spot beside my
ear. J.J. rolled away. Rosa fired again, but she was blind and merely
hit the floor near my foot. My gun hissed empty and I tossed it aside.


Nobody moved.

Rosa stood there, breathing heavily, looking like a failed extra from
Hellraiser. Ocular fluid ran down her cheeks like tears. I tried not to
wheeze, a finger jammed into my chest wound.

J.J. went <i>plink</i>.
 
Rosa turned and fired, hitting him in the shoulder. I managed to stand
but couldn't help but cough while doing so. She twisted in my direction
and shot me in the thigh, aiming low. I stumbled forward against the
filing cabinet and fell to my knees. I held my breath. A second shot
punched a neat hole in the metal beside my head. J.J. threw a waste
paper basket at Rosa but it bounced harmlessly off her shoulder. She
ignored it, staring at me intently with her ruined eyes.

J.J.s composite pistol teetered on the edge of the filing cabinet above
me, just out of reach.

A thrown paperweight struck the cabinet. The pistol fell and I caught it
before it hit the carpet. Rosa lowered her aim and shot me in the right
forearm. I grunted and threw myself sideways, sprawling on the carpet.
The pistol was in my left hand and I hadn't paid extra to be
ambidextrous. 

Nobody moved.

I tried to breathe just through my nose but blood bubbles were building
up, making me want to sneeze. It was an involuntary reaction and not one
I could override. J.J. motioned for me to throw the gun over, but I
wasn't even sure I could do that.  

The composite pistol fired puissant .22 long rounds - a marksman load
with bugger-all stopping power. Unless I could hit something vital,
shooting Rosa was just advertising my presence. I forced my wounded arm
into play and pulled back the fountain pen breech, ejecting a round. The
bullet rolled across the parquet strip that ran between the door and
desk - an unmistakable sound. Rosa had no way of knowing what weapon I
held.

J.J. coughed. "Give it up, Rosa, Hess has you cold. All we want is the
name of your backer. Tell us that and nobody has to die."

She stiffened. "My life is not yours to give or take." Rosa placed the
muzzle under her chin and pulled the trigger. The bullet blew the top of
her skull off and embedded itself in the ceiling. The corpse collapsed
in a heap.

J.J. crawled over to retrieve her gun and then sat back against the
wall. He didn't look so good. I managed to prop myself up against the
filing cabinet. What bodily sensations I let myself experience didn't
feel great.

A small dog, a terrier, trotted into the room. He wore a coat labeled
'Security' and carried a webcam around his neck. Given the extensive
CCTV coverage of the ranges I hoped nobody was paying much attention to
their roving reporter. The dog sniffed my foot, then sat down at my side
and licked his balls.

I jammed a fold of cloth into my chest wound and tried to breathe. "How
the hell do we get out of this, J-J? We got three bodies and enough
evidence so that even the local cops could make a case. And if the
Turing boys get a sniff of <i>that-</i>" I gestured towards the dead
avatar of Howard Ghent, "-we'll feel some serious heat."

He didn't answer. The dog sat and panted, his tongue lolling. I wheezed
and burbled. J.J went <i>plink</i>.

Finally he smiled at me and the dog. "Hang on lads, I've got a great
idea…"

The street lighting had been turned up, as was the custom when Dempols
were making an arrest. Not merely spotlit: they carved everything out in
sharp, varnished focus. Those on the sidewalks could see the droplets of
sweat on Peter Lava's cheeks. Others had remained inside to watch--their
TV's interrupting their usual evening's viewing to relay pictures of
what was transpiring just beyond their front doors.

In the street, no one made a noise.

On the TV transmission, jeering and insults swept back and forth like
broken shells chewed and spat by an angry tide.

Peter Lava went serenely, unchaperoned, to the waiting vehicle to be
whisked off to Dempol Park 634.

<p class="drop">"Enter, Peter Lava. Sit only in the seat marked with
your name."

Peter's full electoral name shone in green neon along its back. Like on
one of those old, director's chairs from the days of celluloid movies.
Monitors recorded his movements, adjusted room temperature to take
account of subtle changes wrought by his perspiration and lighting
soundlessly flicked sections on and off to cut out any shadow he might
have cast.

The seat accepted him, learnt his shape, and then continued to fine-tune
to give the illusion it was merely an extension of his own anatomy. Or
that he wasn't sitting at all, but suspended in mid-air.

"You have committed a Demcrime. You have the right to enter a plea. Your
failure to admit your culpability at this stage will have a bearing on
your sentence."

Seconds built into minutes. 

A sign flashed with the message "The longer you delay, the longer your
sentence."

Tock. Tock. Tock. Not counting time: each electronic tongue-cluck
signifying instead an extra hour, day, week, maybe even a year. He
hadn't caught the last vote on sentencing issues.

After twenty-one regulation minutes, the voice cut in:

"Your failure to enter a plea means one must be entered for you. If no
plea is entered in the next ten seconds, the maximum penalty will be
applied."

There was a dull, granite-grey square on the opposite wall. The light
beyond was muted--identical to that of the night outside. It might have
been a screen, might have been a window. Maybe neither.

"Insanity," Peter said.

"That plea is not an accepted option."

"Just cause."

"That plea not an accepted option."

"Diminished-."

"That plea not an accepted option."

"My democratic right to choose."

"That plea is not an accepted option."

Now isn't that an irony?

<p class="drop">Bradley heard of his brother's arrest the following
morning.

He lived in a district too far away to have caught the live broadcast.
That morning, the heavy curtainwall that shielded his house against the
light-pollution that kept the town looking as grainy as cheap newsprint
even at night, slid halfway back and stuck. As he was dialling for an
Auto-rep the Newsbox detected his presence and switched itself on.

The news had been tailored specifically for him by the Personal Default
settings and so the very first thing he heard about was his brother's
arrest.

Peter.

A Demcrime?

It was their mother's fault. Bradley, as the older brother, had had
father around long enough to soften the impact of her sermonising. But
when father had left because he couldn't take any more, little Peter had
become her little academic Adonis: listening rapt and unquestioning to
every word she'd expounded. The two had become totally dependent on each
other. Teller and Told. 

<p class="drop">"Bradley," Peter said, smiling. "I was wondering whether
you'd come. How's Martia?"

"She's fine. Visiting her grandmother."

"Yes?" That was the third wife that had left him. Shame. Martia was the
only one of the three that had actually laughed once in a while.

"So. You've finally done it then? You idiot."

"Pressed this morning?"

"As has everyone."

"Not me. Not here. The insane, the young and the incarcerated lose their
right to vote."

"So you should be happy, then. Finally got what you wanted?"

"Now that would be the second irony of these last twenty-four hours."

<p class="drop">He had another visitor.

There was a seventy-two-hour period before the convicted went off to
begin their sentences when they could receive guests. Peter hadn't even
counted on Bradley coming--he certainly wasn't expected anyone else.

"Martia? This is a surprise." She mumbled something. There was a
crumpled tissue in her fist, eyes puffy, cheeks red and raw-looking.
"Sorry to hear about you and Bradley."

"Oh, Peter. I saw you on TV last night. I saw…"

Her grandmother's place must have been in his zone. The fact he hadn't
known this just went to show how little families shared these days. The
old woman could have lived next-door to him and he wouldn't have known.

"Well…" Peter shifted uncomfortably in his movie director chair. His
brother hadn't made him feel nervous or even guilty about what he'd
done, but this tearful woman somehow did.

"Why did you do it? I mean…a Demcrime? Of all the…"

He shrugged. The action felt absurdly adolescent and so he scraped
around for words:

"It's not really as if there are any other crimes one can commit." The
observation brought a sharp intake of breath.

"Don't make it worse on yourself, Peter."

"I'm not intending to. And, anyway: that was just an observation, not a
criticism. Well, not a direct one, at least." He smiled awkwardly at his
clumsily assembled justification.

"What is it you did?" He saw the intrigue in her eyes. Was that why
she'd come--to be titillated? He told her regardless.

"I rubbered my print, rigged up a randomiser to do the choosing, let it
vote and confirm on my behalf."

"You did what? I can't believe you would do such a thing!"

For the first time, he felt cold fingers of apprehension play a scale
down his spine. He really had done something big. Maybe too big. And
there was a possibility the principles he'd been fighting for no longer
looked half as big as those he'd flouted. He'd broken the sacred Demrule
of 'Thou Shalt Vote.' The First Commandment. Not a right, but a duty. A
legal duty, whose failure was punished accordingly.

"And so all your votes have been taken by…"

"A rubber finger on a pivot, basically. I tied it up with
voice-recognition software so it responded to the call to vote. The
actual decision was made like a coin toss. The recess announcement reset
everything after each session."

"You did all that? How?"

"I guess I just figured it out."

"Without an Auto?"

"Without an Auto."

"Can you actually do that? Really?"

"It wasn't that difficult. A standard electrical circuit is really just
a closed loop. Once you know that, anything's possible."

A closed loop, she mouthed, probably not even aware of it.

"And now you're here," she said, shaking her head.

"Now I'm here." 

"Why?"

"…did I do it?" She nodded. Peter sighed. "You know, since everything
began to be done by the Autos, all we were left to do was create the
ultimate democracy. We finally got to vote on everything--every tiny
little thing is decided not by some faceless politician but by the
people themselves. Everyone has a vote. True, direct democracy at work."

"Exactly. That's why I don't understand…"

He held up a hand. "Oh, I admit it's what every libertarian has always
dreamed of."

"We all have a say."

"Yes? But on every tiny, inconsequential issue? What do I know about the
optimal sugar content of a loaf of bread? What do I even care about the
ratio of red to yellow-and-orange tulips in the Demparks? And why should
I be telling a baker or a landscape gardener what they know better than
me?"

"A baker? I don't understand."

"Exactly! Because none of these professions even exist anymore! The
Autos do everything. So why the hell are we even being consulted? It's
all armchair whims." He heard his mother telling him this. Telling him
until he could close his eyes, hold her opinions in his head, and let
them work his lips. 

I miss you.

"And when we don't want to think about an issue, we just toss a mental
coin and let it decide. Wasn't that merely what I was doing?"

Martia didn't meet his eyes. He realised the last comment had come out
as a plea for understanding, not a bold declaration of his beliefs or
rights. He was grovelling for scraps of comfort when he had already
sealed his fate.

For what?

Why had he really done it? Hearing it spoken now didn't even convince
him it had been worth it. They did have things good. The Autos had
released them. Every man and woman did, finally, have a say in the
running of things. So what was his problem?

Mother would have been able to tell him.

"I ought to go. I've got things to do. Sorry." Martia stood, eyes still
trained deliberately away.

He continued to wait for her answer nonetheless.

The doors slid open, closed behind her.

The last two days had provided him with more conversation than the
preceding two years.

Since mother had died.

"I'm hungry," he complained to the empty room.

"It is not yet time to eat. You have forfeited the right to eat at a
time of your own choosing."

"Aren't you going to ask me what I want for dinner?"

"You have forfeited the right to choose."

He bowed his head, sulking. But beneath it, a smile lingered.

Better. So much better. He hugged his chest, rocked a little. He was
home again. And, in an infant's whisper: "Yes, mother."
