<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>
<p><strong>Mythaxis is open for submissions!</strong> We seek and offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Length</strong>: 1,000-7,500 words. This is a firm limit. Generally speaking, the further a story goes beyond 5,000 words the more it will need to impress, but the door is not shut in advance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $20 on acceptance and return of contract. Payment via PayPal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to acknowledge submissions the same day they are received. I<strong>f you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch</strong>.</p>
<p>We aim to accept or reject within 14 days of that acknowledgment, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. <strong>If you do not hear from us after 30 days, feel free to query</strong>.</p>
<p>We require <strong>First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity</strong> from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies, in event of which an additional full payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the author.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged</strong>. Put your work out there, as many places as you can! We merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible. <strong>We do not currently invite reprint submissions</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions should be anonymous</strong>, and do not require a cover page. Only include the story title, the approximate word count, and the story text. Do not include the author’s name in or on the file.</p>
<p><strong>All submissions must be the original work of the author</strong>. We anticipate an adult readership in the sense of maturity, but this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content.</p>
<p><strong>We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds</strong>, be they cultural or personal, and submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences, provided they do not seek to attack or demean those of others.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>FORMATTING GUIDELINES</p>
<p>Acceptable document types are RTF, DOC, or DOCX.</p>
<p>Straightforward manuscript formatting is preferred for editorial convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please use an easy-reading font (Times New Roman 12pt, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Do not manually insert empty lines between paragraphs, or use tabs for first-line indents. <strong>Use paragraph formatting</strong> to set automatic indents or paragraph breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a single centred # to represent essential section breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <em>italics</em> for italics, <span class="underline">don’t underline</span> instead. Smart (“curly”) punctuation is fine.</p></li>
<li><p>If your manuscript includes any unusual formatting, please alert the editors when submitting and have a really good, story-related reason.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the editor at the above address. We look forward to reading your work!</p>
