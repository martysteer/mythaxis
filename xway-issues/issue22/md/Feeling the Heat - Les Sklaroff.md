FEELING THE HEAT: A TWICE-TOLD TALE

Les Sklaroff

\-

*We begin this issue with a piece by a long-time contributor and old
friend of Gil's, which places front and center that thorny problem of
what makes writing good. Perhaps the solution is to admit that writing
simply IS good, whether it is ugly or beautiful, famous or infamous,
read or unread*.

With a grunt of distaste Strag flung the book across the room. Propelled
by a casual flick of the wrist it landed accurately in the safety of an
armchair. He had an instinctive feeling for the right trajectory,
perhaps related to his youthful practice of hurling various objects
(some edible) to be intercepted by an apparently tireless dog.

This indoor launch of the papery embodiment of Seff Haldegath, writer of
a succession of spy thrillers, afforded Strag a frisson of satisfaction,
almost bereft of guilt. Old Sprent would be appalled to see his young
editorial assistant treating an actual book with such disrespect, no
matter how banal its content, or how brief its flight.

Strag had picked up the book cheaply at Morg's Bookery in the market,
one of his and Yethne's favourite haunts. Only the previous week they
had been lucky enough to find a copy of Parel Tillon's *Hoarse
Whispers*, unusually bound, he supposed as a student exercise, in
textured whent, with beautifully marbled endpapers. This week's
impulsive purchase, made while Yethne was away at an educational
conference, he had found to be less rewarding.

Haldegath, who had reputedly spent some years in government service,
churned out fat popular books of no discernable literary worth. Within
the garish holographic artwork of the covers the same embittered
protagonist, Statman Gyme, recurrently avoided death while outwitting
psychopathic adversaries. The style was blunt, plots implausible,
studded with scenes of sudden violence and desultory sex. Strag, an
insatiable reader, knew he had encountered books by Haldegath before,
and should have known what to expect, but the copy of *Firemonger* which
lay rejected in the chair merely reminded him that, despite Haldegath's
enviable commercial success, he found this author's work unmemorable.

As an aspiring writer himself, fortified by the high standards of
literacy expected at Fissile & Sprent, Strag knew that he needed to
resolve a troubling question. Could the kind of acclaim enjoyed by Seff
Haldegath be achieved without resort to the same facile formulaic
tricks? Probably not, he conceded ruefully, but at this moment what he
really wanted to do was to expose Haldegath as a hack writer by
demonstrating how much better one of his books could have been, in the
hands of someone like himself, who strove to use words not as bludgeons,
but as instruments of subtle persuasion. He stared resentfully across
the room at *Firemonger*. Its microsensors responded by causing its
cover to appear to smoulder.

What would be most satisfying, he reflected, would be to take a
Haldegath novel, strip it of its dross, and re-work what remained into
something with far more depth and resonance. He retrieved the copy of
*Firemonger*, re-read the first few pages, extruded the workdesk, and
began to jot down a few comments before attempting his own creative
improvements.

> *Clarify plot. Condense.*
>
> *Less gore. Some credible foreplay (Check with Y).*
>
> *Essential tech. specs only for weaponry and other devices.*
>
> *Link characters to archetypes?*
>
> *Spycraft. Consult H D Kruving's 'The Dislocator'.*
>
> *Intersperse musical theme.*
>
> *Chapter headings. Elements from Shaunt's 'Black Fire' tapestries.*

He would need to change the names, of course. The reckless Statman Gyme,
product of a clandestine liaison between a flotel sanitation officer and
a part-time waitress, would now become Scover Buron, son of a feisty
woman journalist and an absentee but distinguished father whose
undisclosed identity would be crucial to the revised plot. Silki Lissom,
the ditzy, fun-loving art therapist with a propensity for finding
herself in life-theatening situations, will be replaced by the succulent
but enigmatic Sireen Thrist, a research chemist with a range of skills
not restricted to scientific enquiry.

There were some vestiges of an earlier age with which Strag Wilderfoot
was oddly comfortable, in spite of the many modern refinements at his
disposal. He preferred the feel of flowing water to hygienic
cloud-sprays, had no time for ParaPets, however sophisticated, and
although he had ready access to interactive devices, he relished the
tactile intimacy of pen and paper. Turning to a fresh page with a firm
sense of purpose, he wrote:

*[Firemonger]{.underline} Renewed. By S.W.*

Strag stared at this. It was an accurate enough statement of intent, but
he had an uneasy suspicion it might lead to legal complications. He
would have to be more circumspect. After a few moments' thought he
amended the title:

*~~[Firemonger]{.underline} Renewed~~ [Slaying with Fire]{.underline} By
S.W.*

That was better. It carried a touch of menace tempered by the hint of a
pun, and no longer referred directly to the Haldegath book. On
reflection, Strag decided he would use a pseudonym, not primarily to
disguise his own identity, but to establish the worth of the writing
independently of its author. After a few scribbled possibilities, he
settled on:

*[Slaying with Fire]{.underline}. By Morlan Corrovine*

He didn't know anyone called Morlan, but it sounded suitably non
gender-specific, and Corrovine, he thought, had a kind of respectable
gravitas. So be it. The upstart Morlan Corrovine would now take on the
entire domain of seedy pap as exemplified by Haldegath. It was to be an
exercise in enlightenment.

Strag chose to say nothing yet to his employer about this enterprise,
even though the venerable Pentheus Sprent had been sympathetic to his
literary aspirations as early as their first meeting, when barely out of
school, the boy had arrived uninvited, in need of friendship, guidance,
training and somewhere to live. As long as Strag continued to be
diligent at work, it was not Sprent's concern what he got up to in the
privacy of his new apartment. Sprent, whose faculties were still sharp,
knew that young Wilderfoot now lived with one of the girls he had met at
the Wheggs place near the park, since when he had noticed that while no
less headstrong, the lad seemed more at ease with the world.

Skimming through the text, Strag had decided that it would resolve
neatly into eight sections, which conveniently matched the sequence of
themes he planned to incorporate from the 'Black Fire' tapestries of
Tosmor Shaunt. Thanks to a generous grant, those extraordinary works had
found a permanent home in the foyer of Sparagulan College Auditorium,
and had since gained a reputation well beyond the confines of Snoak
City.

Not long after his arrival in Snoak, eager to sample urban culture,
Strag had been cajoled by his fellow lodgers into attending a
performance by Feblo Carribask, but the singer's energetic exertions
were eclipsed in his memory by that first stunning sight of the
tapestries. Subsequent visits to the Auditorium were made simply to
luxuriate in the haunting brilliance of Shaunt's apocalyptic vision.

Knowing that Strag would probably be in bed, Yethne had let herself in
quietly, having left the rather misleadingly-named 'conference' in time
to catch a nightpod back from Platport, which brought her home just
after midnight.

She was tired, dissatisfied, and in need of comfort. A succession of
earnest lecturers in education had informed the delegates of promising
advances in developmental theory, offering some interesting statistical
evidence based on historical samples, but it was apparent that unlike
the bulk of their tolerant audience, they lacked the fundamental benefit
of practical experience. What they called the 'norm' was no more than a
convenient abstraction held dear by academics. Her perspective was based
on daily interaction with a volatile young group of evolving identities,
variously fragile, resilient, excitable, stubborn, morose, anxious to
please, complacent, burdened with private grief, preoccupied with
fantasy, stung by insult, mute with inexpressible yearning. Each day
demanded alertness, patience, and a multiplicity of fine judgements. It
was never effortless, but she tried valiantly to remain unruffled.
Yethne might have been disheartened to know how few of her colleagues
shared the same outlook.

*Why had Strag left the light on?* she wondered, as she hung up her
coat. Entering the room she discovered him asleep in a chair, head
resting on the arm which lay sprawled across the workdesk. Torn between
solicitude and expediency, she tiptoed over, pressed her lips to his
ear, and was duly thankful when he awoke without complaint.

"Glad you made it back," he murmured, turning to kiss her. She was
trembling slightly, and he could sense that she was unsettled. He held
her close, caressing her hair.

"How did it go?" he asked. "Do you want to talk about it now, or shall
we leave it until tomorrow?"

"Oh, it can wait," said Yethne, stifling a yawn. She reached for his
hand. "Let's get comfortable. But tell me, what have you been working on
so late?"

Strag hesitated. Yethne understood his aspirations, and he needed to
discuss his ideas with her, but just now the lure of bed took
precedence.

"It's a kind of experiment. I'll explain in the morning. It's the
week-end. We both deserve a lie-in, and there's a chance I might bring
you breakfast." He adopted what he hoped was an enigmatic expression and
made a melodramatic bow "Meanwhile, milady, Morlan Corrovine is at your
service."

"Ooh, rôle-play," said Yethne coyly, with a sleepy smile.

\#

"Have you read any Seth Haldegath?" he asked. They had spent a very
relaxed morning, during which she had been relieved to vent her
reservations about the Platport 'conference'.

"No, I don't think so." He handed her the copy of *Firemonger*, and
suggested that she should sample it and offer her opinion. Yethne
glanced dubiously at the cover and settled into her favourite chair.
After a few minutes she looked up. "Well, the characters seem rather
one-dimensional, there's a lot of brutality, the plot's not very clear,
and I'm fairly sure that Togger Chorp could do better."

Momentarily puzzled, Strag searched his memory. "Oh, you mean the boy in
your class? The one who..."

"...has a passion for ants, affects not to listen, doesn't speak much,
has a step-brother who bullies him, and parents hooked on vids. Despite
which, he writes really imaginative, well-constructed stories."

Strag smiled. "That's exactly my point! Haldegath makes a living from
selling this sordid, soulless stuff, and I'm guessing that most of the
people who buy these books don't realise that he's a charlatan. So I've
started -- as Morlan Corrovine -- to re-write this book, using its bones
as a kind of armature on which to build something much more stylish and
meaningful."

Yethne didn't want to see his time and talent expended on what looked
like a secondhand project. She admired his enthusiasm, but needed some
convincing that what Strag was attempting was really worthwhile. "Show
me," she said.

It was thanks to Yethne that he hit upon the musical theme which would
recur in various guises at critical moments, being played, sung or
chanted, or simply as a persistent earworm in Scover Buron's head.
*Wessy Pilfrel* was a doleful traditional ballad about an unfortunate
girl's disintegration into madness. Because of its repetitive structure
it also existed in a merrier form as a children's skipping rhyme. Both
versions begin with the same first line:

> *Wessy Pilfrel lost a sock...*

In the ballad, she goes on to lose her way, her heart, her virtue, and
eventually her mind. The skipping versions, with their indeterminate
number of verses, often spontaneous, have her losing not only other
articles of clothing, but all manner of things -- voice, teeth, soap,
pets, temper -- with results that have kept children amused for
generations. Strag felt that judicious insertion of lines from *Wessy
Pilfrel* would serve as psychological signposts for the reader.

Strag made rapid progress through the first four chapters. Scover Buron
had temporarily eluded his pursuers, undoubtedly members of the same
mercenary gang who had murdered Hecht. He'd had just enough time to
create a diversion with a 'rabid hounds' sonic grenade, and had managed
to escape with the device, but too late to save the scientist's life.
Later that night, travelling west on the transporter, he found that the
device was becoming literally too hot to handle.

In Chapter 5 ('*Forge*'), Buron is working on ways to bring Hecht's
assassins to justice. He tries to ignore the faint high-pitched humming
now emanating from the overheating device which he had gingerly
deposited on the tiled bathroom floor of the safe-house. A quiet tap on
the door signals the arrival of the technical expert sent to deal with
problem. It is Sireen Thrist.

"Surely you're not going to let them get drunk?" Yethne protested,
resting her chin on Strag's shoulder.

"I haven't quite decided yet whether there's any drink to be had!" Strag
said. "Buron's a seasoned agent, but he's been under stress, and the
resourceful Sireen obviously needs to unwind. I think I might allow them
a bit of relaxation. Bear in mind that by this point Haldegath's
characters would already be sweaty and grunty."

"Like in *Glow Bright and the Humunculi*? suggested Yethne, feigning
innocence. "I can never remember all their names."

"Crazy, Sleazy, Breezy and Queasy," said Strag. "Not to mention Teasy,"
he added pointedly, swivelling round to face her. "Now, Sireen Thrist is
about to discover a half-bottle of a quite palatable liqueur in one of
the kitchen cupboards, and despite her earlier abruptness, she will
generously offer to share it with Scover. Will he accept, I wonder?"

"All right, Morlan the Mysterious, my writer-in-residence, I can take a
hint. I'll leave you to get them acquainted. If you need my help with
any... tricky bits, come and find me."

"I really appreciate that, Yeth," he said, with absolute sincerity.

"Why '229'?" Yethne had wanted to know, but Strag was busy working on
the next chapter ('*Scorched Earth'*), and muttered distractedly that it
was a prime number with some interesting mathematical peculiarities.
"Try reversing it and adding..." He tailed off in mid-sentence,
evidently following a different train of thought. She retreated
prudently, considered the idea of a quick cloud-spray, but decided
instead to treat herself to a proper shower.

It might have been the faint sound of streaming water that prompted
Strag to contrive in that same chapter the seemingly accidental drowning
of two burly middle-aged men. He had Forensics declare that they had
both been in good health, which would have been no consolation to the
deceased. Buron would have recognised them as the two incompetent
pursuers he had eluded in Broskol. Their ignominious end in a muddy
roadside gully was a definite indication that '229' had a dangerously
low tolerance for incompetence. Strag suddenly realised that even though
the subject matter had not strictly been of his own choosing, what had
begun as a literary exercise had become a compulsive immersion in this
simulated world. He could now admit, grudgingly, that even Haldegath,
with all his shortcomings and presumed cupidity, might also enjoy the
creative thrill of writing. They were members of the same virtual
community. Perhaps he had been too harsh in his condemnation. If there
could be honour amongst thieves, why not magnanimity amongst writers?

Strag felt, oddly, as if a burden had been lifted, and turned his
thoughts with relish to the penultimate chapter. In the *Black Fire*
schema the heading was *Embers*, but there was to be nothing quiescent
about the action. It was now that The Feathermen were revealed at their
most ruthless, in a spate of violent robberies and several high-profile
kidnappings. Prominent figures were subject to blackmail, public
services repeatedly disrupted by means of sabotage or by panic induced
by maliciously spread rumours of an imminent hazard -- a gas leak, a
toxic spillage, contagious disease, escaped warthogs.... Street-children
were bribed to leave suspicious packages wherever they would cause most
concern and inconvenience. '229' was exacting revenge, and still among
the prime targets was Scover Buron.

At the start of *Phoenix*, the final chapter, Craunt is wrestling with
an invidious dilemma. Citizens are fearful, those sworn to protect them
appear to be helpless. His best agent is on the hit list of an
unscrupulous killer whose real name and whereabouts are still unknown.
It had become necessary to draw the killer out somehow. Use bait. The
obvious bait would be Buron, but Buron is indispensable. Who else had
the same set of skills, the same fast-thinking ability to plan on the
move and under pressure? Craunt knew of only one other person who had a
chance of tracking '229' to his or her lair, but that would mean having
to break a long-standing promise, thereby putting both of them, father
and son, in mortal danger.

He had his hand poised to make the call when he was interrupted by an
urgent message from his regional director, informing him that Sireen
Thrist had disappeared.

"I doubt that even Togger Chorp could have managed a neater ending!"
said Yethne, handing the last page back to Strag, who had been patiently
awaiting her comments. "Unmasking the odious '229', finding the girl,
reconciling the long-separated agents, but leaving that final seed of
doubt for the reader to worry about."

"Thanks, Yeth, that's praise indeed; possibly more than I deserve. I
must admit it was challenging tying up the loose ends, but I hope I've
got away with it. We'll see."

*Slaying with Fire* edged into print under the benevolent dispensation
of Pentheus Sprent. Wishing to preserve his anonymity, Strag insisted
there should be no launch party, but agreed to discreet advance notices
about the book's forthcoming appearance. Fissile & Sprent had a
reputation for being discriminating publishers, so the arrival on the
scene of the previously unknown Morlan Corrovine was bound to stir
ripples of interest. The trial print run was of no more than a few
hundred copies, not unusual for an author's first book. The
unostentatious covers depicted sparks from a flint against a background
of velvet blackness. If it failed to do well, any loss would not be too
disastrous, and if it later chanced to become a cult classic, the unsold
copies would become collectors' items.

Early reviews were models of enthusiastic waffling, presumably by
critics who had not yet read the book, amply padded with phrases such as
"bright new talent", "fresh approach" and "gripping page-turner".
Pentheus Sprent had forewarned him that without a formal launch initial
sales might be slow. Strag had no option but to try to curb an
unaccustomed sense of anxiety and to bide his time. Yethne did her best
to cope with the nervous excitement.

The tension was unexpectedly mitigated by the arrival of an
old-fashioned hand-written letter, addressed to him, not as Morlan
Corrovine, but in his own name, Strag Wilderfoot, c/o Fissile & Sprent.
The script was firm, clear and unfussy, without flourishes. The letter
congratulated him on the publication of his first book and complimented
him on the polish and subtlety of his writing. There was a brief coda:

> *You may be aware that I am familiar with this particular genre.
> Having spent much of my early life working in the murky realm of
> secrecy and subterfuge, I can assure you that in reality tedium
> out-weighs excitement by a considerable factor. Trying to prevent or
> repair the blunders of those who wear the public mantle of
> 'decision-makers', and the thwarting of scoundrels in general is a
> wearying business, requiring constant observation, consultation and
> analysis. Most readers of fiction would find such details stultifying.
> As a form of catharsis I amuse myself by providing them instead with
> spicy confections. It is flattering to see that in many respects you
> have followed my example. However, there are multiple paths. I look
> forward to monitoring your progress.*
>
> *- Seff Haldegath*

Strag read the letter several times. He was shocked at how easily his
pen-name had been bypassed, but reasoned that it only served to confirm
his correspondent's credentials. He could hardly believe that what he
was holding in slightly shaky fingers was a personal message from the
man himself! A man he had naïvely held in such disregard, but who was
clearly thoughtful and articulate, and who had taken time to encourage a
new writer.

"You're looking particularly smug," Yethne remarked when Strag arrived
back at their flat. Her endearing knack of interpreting his mood at a
glance sometimes made him feel quite vulnerable.

He prevaricated. "Smug? Well, surprised, yes. Even gratified, I suppose,
but..."

"What *is* it, Strag Tell me!"

He handed her the letter, noticing her brief frown as she saw how
precisely it was addressed. She began to read it aloud, causing Strag to
smile at this echo of classroom practice. It was difficult for him to be
objective, but actually hearing Haldegath's words he thought he detected
in them just a trace of irony, or was it perhaps condescension?

"How extraordinary", said Yethne, "A fan letter! From Seth Haldegath,
your prime target."

Striving to restore his ruffled self-confidence he fixed her with a gaze
in which he attempted to combine insouciance with owl-like intensity.
"We writers are full of surprises. I doubt that's even his real name."
