[*BLURB] Welcome to the 15th issue of Mythaxis.
 


[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>The Mythaxis editorial office creaks into
action again with this (I can hardly believe it) fifteenth issue of
Mythaxis Magazine. Once again, we offer a wide range of science fiction
and fantasy, including two more stories from Les Sklaroff's parallel
world, two more from Martin Clark's future noir, a titillating tale from
Andrew Leon Hunter and a look at justice from Jez Patterson.

And (thanks to Sean Crawford's <b>Plains of Abyssinia</b>) high-octane
memoirs of the LSD-fuelled 1960s.

My own memories of the 1960s are less remarkable, and include:<ul>
<li>a large disk storage unit, installed in a skyscraper, which, due to
gyroscopic effects, tore up its anchors and started to walk across the
room when the building swayed slightly in a high wind.
<li>early, huge, laser printers which toasted (to a rich brown)the
continuous stationery they used, and took minutes, and several yards of
paper, to get up to speed and to slow down. If all you needed was a
couple of lines of diagnostics, it made for quite a paper chase.
<li>an experimental machine which chopped up documents and stuffed them
into envelopes in real time as they poured out of the vast printers that
were popular back then.
</ul>
Oh, the good old days.

<div class=pullquote><img src="peripheralbkmk2.jpg" ></div>However, back
to
business. This edition of Mythaxis Magazine coincides
with the release of <I>William Gibson's</I> novel, <b>The
Peripheral</b>, a review of which appears in the <a
href="http://mythaxis.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/the-peripheral-by-william-gibson/"
target=blank>Mythaxis blog</a>.

In other news, we have updated the Mythaxis blog with a number of your
editor's earlier reviews of books by William Gibson and Iain M Banks.

There is also a new page on the Mythaxis blog, called <a href=
"http://mythaxis.wordpress.com/one-line-movie-reviews/"
target=blank>One-Line Movie Reviews.</a> Most of them are not, in fact,
only one line long, but they are brief enough to give your editor's
trenchant view.

[*ITEM] Slippage

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] There's: Truths, Half-Truths, Lies and... Slippage
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">For much of the last century the property,
a basement in the Bloomsbury
area, had belonged to Cyril Garring-Pugh, a reclusive minor aristocrat
with sufficient funds to indulge his relatively few interests,
principally fine wines, good books and compliant women.  In his later
years he became obsessed by elf-lore, and spent much of his time
studying runes, and, it was rumoured, conducting curious experiments.
Now deceased, the owner had no close family.  The odd manner of his
death had been the cause of some speculation, and according to reports,
the police were keeping their files open - which meant closed to
investigative journalists.  The cellar was long depleted, the women
vanished into the night.  All that remained were the books, which Milner
(as he currently prefers to be known), with his impeccable credentials
(and his own unique private library), had been asked to examine on
behalf of the executors.  They made no objection when he asked if I, as
his most recent amanuensis, might accompany him.

<div class=pullquote>Wasn't a printer's devil some sort of
apprentice?</div>A thin layer of dust had settled on every surface, but
fortunately the
ventilation system had kept the books dry and free from mould.  Milner
glanced again at the book I'd handed him with a wry smile - the first
one that had caught my eye: a copy, according to the title on the spine,
of <b><i>Leak House</i></b> by Dickens.   "I'd say, young Arnold,  that
this
may well be a typical example of a printer's devil at work.  You do
realise that the lost 'B' is not a sign of wear," he said earnestly,   
angling the book so that I could see the title-page. <b>LEAK HOUSE</b>
it stated again, unmistakably, in large clear capitals.  There was no
trace of erasure. 

My smile faded.  "That's very peculiar" I said.  "But
wasn't a printer's devil some sort of apprentice?"

"A common misconception, dating back to the seventeenth century,"
Milner replied.  "At the very least, this is symptomatic of mischievous
slippage.  No, my friend, it looks as though Garring-Pugh must have
given serious offence, however inadvertently, to the elvish
community, and the consequences, as I have reason to know, can be rather
unfortunate.  I fear this entire collection may have suffered.  I
suggest we try selecting a few more at random."

He crossed the room, and with remarkable suppleness for a man of his
considerable age reached up to a shelf above his head, and took down a
book.  It was an English translation of Flaubert's <b><i>Madame
Ovary</i></b>.
"Dear me," said Milner, "A trifle indelicate, wouldn't you say?  Try
choosing one at random."  I looked around.  In a small bookcase there
were some elderly-looking children's books.  

I picked out one with a
dark red binding.  "<b><i>Lice in Wonderland</i></b>," I called out,
disbelievingly. 

"Most unpleasant," said Milner, reaching for another.
"Here's <b><i>The Tim Machine</i></b>."

"Now there's a coincidence," I said,
spotting a petulant-sounding title by Aldous Huxley: <b><i>Tim Must Have
a
Top</i></b>.

"Typical elf-meddling," mused Milner.  "And also an example of
double slippage. Definitely mischievous, bordering on the
disrespectful."

We took turns, calling out the titles as we found them.  Wherever we
looked, irreverent slippage had occurred:  <b><i>The Heat of Midlothian
-
Three Men in a Boa - Put Out More Fags - Our Ma in Havana</i></b>.
Clear
indication, as I was now persuaded, of the work of seriously offended
elves.

"Can anything be done about this?" I asked Milner, replacing a copy of
<b><i>Wok Suspended</i></b> between <b><i>A Midsummer Night's
Dram</i></b> and
Poe's
<b><i>Ales of Mystery and Imagination</i></b>.

He stroked his stylishly
shortened beard. "As it happens," he said, delving into a pocket,
"Knowing Garring-Pugh's reputation, I took the precaution of bringing
with me a specific remedy. You won't find it in the shops; it's a
formula I prepared many years ago for Tom James, a young librarian in
Oxford." He withdrew a small blue glass phial, and gently levered off
its cork stopper with his thumb. Immediately I could smell beeswax and
linseed oil, and something else cloyingly sweet, which I was unable to
identify. Milner then moved in front of each set of shelves, waving the
phial in a sinuous motion from top to bottom, murmuring something
quietly to himself as he did so. "There, that should do the trick," he
said, replacing the stopper, and carefully restoring the phial to his
pocket. "It will probably take full effect in a day or so.  I'll arrange
for us to come back later in the week."   He wandered into the adjoining
room.

Moments later I heard a suppressed groan, and rushed through to join
him.  He was peering at an elegant rosewood cabinet.  "Oh dear, Arnold,
I wonder what Cyril did to piss them off?"  Milner rather enjoyed
keeping up with modern idioms. "They didn't stop at the books.  Do you
remember that rather good American TV series? There's a complete boxed
set of DVDs here."  

"Which one?" I enquired.

He sighed, and reached
again for his little phial.  "See for yourself."  

I looked.  Aaron
Sorkin would not have been pleased.  There was a neat row of seven
successively numbered transparent plastic boxes, each one afflicted with
double slippage, rudely labelled: <b><i>The Wet Wig</i></b>.

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] “In the absence of justice, what is sovereignty but organized
robbery?” <small>St. Augustine</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The inner airlock doors slid open and the
two of us stepped into the ship proper. There was no reception
committee, which is always a good start where larceny is concerned.
Frank glowered at our Spartan surroundings, but then again, he glowers
at everything. "Wealthy as sin and this is the best he can come up with?
I've seen better appointed bus shelters."

I had to admit the access corridor was functional to the point of
bleakness. Not exactly what you'd expect aboard a star yacht owned by
the reclusive tycoon, Lucien Ghent. Everyone we'd spoken to on the space
station had assured us the Scaramanga was a veritable star-faring
pleasure palace. Needless to say, none of the inhabitants of Nebula
Gateway had ever set foot aboard, but all knew of someone who had.

Our sources reported that Ghent had gone loopy - if you could break
<i>in</i>
then he'd let you walk <i>out</i> with as much loot as you could carry,
free
and clear. I'd done my research and that sounded mad enough to be true;
Ghent hadn't been seen in public for almost three years and seemed to
treat interpersonal contact as an unnecessary evil. He'd even replaced
most of the crew with automated systems, not that the Scaramanga was
going anywhere in a hurry. It was tethered to the space station by a
host of hawsers and semi-permanent umbilicals - a parasitic entity that
pretty much summed up the great man himself.

So it was a challenge, but seeing as how Frank is a psychopathic killer
and I can crack any electronic lock ever made, we figured it was worth a
punt. However, if our initial surroundings were anything to go by then
it looked like we'd be leaving empty handed.

There was a flash of light and I felt my skin tingle. Frank hissed at
me, as if keeping his voice down would somehow help. "You said we'd be
invisible to the on-board systems. So how come-"

A synthetic male voice issued from the wall speaker. "Welcome aboard the
Scaramanga. Gentlemen. Please wait one moment."

I could well understand the system's hesitation as my immediate social
circle were heavily into gender morphing. To get back in shape I'd taken
a blitz course of Tee-He, leaving me with a bad case of drug-induced
priapism. Strapping my dick down in an enforced 'dressing on the left'
had left me with a pronounced limp, to the extent I needed a walking
stick to get about.

Water vapor materialized around us, like we'd suddenly flown into a
cloud. I heard Frank cursing but he was lost, obscured by the billowing
white folds. As suddenly as it had appeared the mist dissolved away, as
if burnt off by the rising sun.

And it had.

We were standing on a rock outcrop, a kind of ersatz observation
platform jutting out from the hillside. The sun had just cleared the
ridge behind us, throwing the semi-tropical valley below into stark
relief. There was no sign of life, let alone civilization, to mar the
lush sweep of vegetation. Away to the left lay the blue haze of the
ocean, and that was that. We were at altitude, but nothing
uncomfortable. I took a deep breath of fresh air which quite lacked the
antiseptic tang I'd gotten used to during my time in space.

"It's quite something, don't you think?" The voice came from behind us;
male, sounding  amused. I knew instantly I was going to dislike him.

I turned awkwardly, leaning on my cane. The speaker and a woman stood a
few meters away. He appeared squat in comparison to his companion but
that was due to his wide shoulders and heavy-set features. The woman had
catwalk elegance and eyes the colour of dead neon.

The man gestured out across the valley. "It's a topographical recreation
of Madeira, an island on Earth, complete with micro-climate.
Occasionally we manifest a small villa down on the coast but other than
that the place is uninhabited. I find bringing visitors here, with its
sense of isolation, leaves them feeling-"

"Disconcerted?" I smiled. Frank chewed on a fingernail and said nothing.

Our host inclined his head. "Quite. I'm-"

"Arturo Roth, your employer's go-to guy and proxy on the board of
Ghent's corporations. Your companion is Sara Hotchkiss, the proverbial
'personal assistant'. But not personal enough, apparently, to warrant a
bodyguard when she leaves the ship. Whereas you, sir, never go anywhere
without a small army in tow. Some might call it paranoia but given the
number of enemies you've acquired I'd say your precautions are entirely
justified."

Roth kept up the smile although his eyes hardened. "I see you've done
your homework. Unfortunately you have us at a disadvantage as I rarely
interest myself in those who-"

"I'm Jerry. This is my brother, Frank."

Cutting him off like that obviously got under Roth's skin. He dropped
the forced good humour and his tone turned dismissive. "Well, it's been
a pleasure meeting you both. I'll leave you in the capable hands of Sara
for the duration of your stay but I'm afraid we won't meet again."

I grinned. "You never know. It's nice here, so Frank and I might still
be around when you get back. I have to say, as virtual reality
environments go this one is top-notch."

Roth paused in the act of turning away. "Virtual? Oh, no. This may be a
shining example of artifice but there's nothing artificial about it, I
assure you. And what I should have said is that you'll be dead long
before I return. Please accept my apologies for any confusion that might
have caused." Before I could reply he went from three-dimensional to
bas-relief to no more than a cardboard cut-out, and dissolved into
nothingness.

Frank giggled, nervously. 

With Roth gone Sara seemed to come alive but I cut in before she could
speak, pointing at the spot where her companion had stood. "That's a
phase-transfer distortion effect, meaning all <i>this</i>..." I gestured
around
us, "…is a live matter stream. But it can't be, not on this scale. Even
if your ship were just one big fusion reactor it couldn't generate
nearly enough power to support a reality bubble this large."

She smiled; all perfect teeth and insincerity. "Ah, but the Scaramanga
is powered by a Beaumont Singularity, more than adequate for even our
exorbitant needs. All <i>this</i>, as you put it, exists merely as a
mote on
the event horizon."

I shied away and even Frank looked worried. My voice trembled. "Fuck
that! There's a damn good reason why a Beaumont is proscribed technology
these days. If your containment field so much as <i>twitches</i> then
this
ship, the station, maybe even the entire system, will collapse in an
instant. So if you don't mind my brother and I will piss off, sharpish."

Sara brushed an errant strand of hair back into place. "But I thought
you were here to rob us? Isn't that why you came aboard?"

"Look, sister, even if that were true then you have to admit the set-up
isn't exactly as advertised. Or is this all some elaborate joke where
Ghent lures us aboard and then watches while we starve to death in his
pocket-universe playpen?"

She laughed. "Oh, no, he really is indifferent to your fate, I assure
you. But being marooned here <i>will</i> be the penalty for attempting
to
escape upon your return to the ship proper. This is essentially a Stone
Age environment and I seriously doubt you possess the skills to survive
for long, even on a diet of fruit and wild vegetables."

"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Either we rob you blind or perish in the
attempt." I sniffed. "So, tell me, if we <i>do</i> manage to pull this
off,
will we get to meet Ghent in person?"

Sara seemed to consider this for a moment. "Well, I'm sure the novelty
would appeal to him, and he has been known to witness the climax of a
break-in attempt, if it's been sufficiently entertaining up to that
point."

"You're not exactly filling me with confidence here, girl. Still,
there's no point in hanging about. Frank?" He nodded, I nodded. "Right
then, Sara, let's be having you."

The world around us seemed to snap shut and open again. We were back in
the access corridor, on our own. I laid a hand on Frank's arm in case he
felt like bugging out, but I needn't have worried. He shook off my grasp
and flexed his fingers. "Anything to say we can't just murder everyone
and bugger off? I don't like being screwed with."

I snorted. "You and me both, man. However I think full-on homicide might
upset the natives a tad, so rein it in for now."

Frank grunted and set off along the corridor with me trailing in his
wake. My augmented vision was sensitive to electronic emissions and heat
bloom, but there were no obvious sensors or hidden anti-intruder
nasties. The phrase 'all too easy' sprang to mind but there was no
option but to press on. Around a dog-leg in the corridor we ran into a
set of double pressure doors blocking our path, with no obvious release
mechanism.

I heaved a sigh of relief. "So now it begins."

My companion shrugged. "Assuming they don't just open onto vacuum."

"That would be crude, and if anything this whole set-up reeks of
over-sophistication. Anyway, by my reckoning we've almost reached the
heart of the ship."

"See if you're wrong, I will <i>so</i> kick your arse in Hell."

I smiled, handed him my cane, and stepped up. My fingers contained an
embedded tracery of electro-magnetic sensors and micro induction field
generators, meaning I could 'feel' and manipulate circuitry - even when
they were concealed beneath layers of ceramic and armour plate. The
locking mechanism was complex, subtle and booby-trapped. Any attempt at
brute force would trigger the deployment of lateral reinforcement bars,
requiring a thermal torch to make any further headway. Not
insurmountable, and the whole setup seemed designed to frustrate and
annoy the intruder rather than stop him dead in his tracks.

I stepped back with a flourish as the doors slid open - to reveal a
short section of corridor and another set of doors. Frank gave me a slow
hand-clap as I limped forward and started over.

I opened the second set of doors.

And the third.

By the time I started in on the fourth set Frank was bored; scratching
Anarchist League graffiti on the walls using the metal tip of my cane. I
glared at him. "Will you stop that? It's an antique original, not some
cheap reproduction. This whole setup is giving me quite enough grief
without you busting my balls as well."

He pouted. "You're the technical one, so get technical. But I'm warning
you, if there's another set of bloody doors beyond this lot I'm breaking
out the binary explosive."

I snorted. "Oh, very subtle, I'm sure. Even if you did manage to blow a
hole big enough to climb through, don't you think the fire suppression
system might sit up and take notice? They usually go for oxygen
depletion in space, not retardant foam, and I for one don't fancy
finding out which is in use aboard this tub."

Frank grunted and switched to twirling my cane, majorette style, while I
got back to work.

The doors opened. 

Beyond lay a large oval chamber, surrounded by a mezzanine metal-grid
walkway that served no obvious purpose. At the far side, opposite the
doorway, stood a wide sofa.

Sara sat there, her arms stretched out along the back of the upholstery.
She gestured to the ice bucket and glasses on a side table. "A glass of
champagne to celebrate getting this far, gentlemen? I assure you it
contains no poison or sedative."

It was hard to pay attention as behind her, piled high as a backdrop,
was enough wealth to turn Ali Baba green with envy. I could see piles of
gold ingots, drifts of precious gems, works of art that hadn't been
heard of in over a century. Plus a selection of proscribed technology
that any major corporation would give their eye-teeth to
reverse-engineer.

Frank handed back my cane and we made our way over to our vapid hostess.
I bowed from the hips. "I'll join you, if I may, while Frank deals with
whatever comes next. And there is something coming next, isn't there,
Sara? After all, a series of locked doors seems somewhat perfunctory."

She patted the sofa beside her. I placed my cane on the table and sat
down, accepting the proffered glass of bubbly. Sara smiled. "Oh, we used
to have guards, electronic wizardry and an array of bio-mechanical
nightmares defending the treasure room. But every guard can be bribed,
every lock can be picked and every cybernetic entity corrupted. Now we
simply depend upon our Hideo."

As she spoke a man entered the room by the way we'd come, the doors
closing behind him. He was small, oriental, dressed like a dock-side
supervisor in short-sleeved khaki shirt and loose pants. The 'Hideo'
were a class of vat-grown assassin, stone killers from the genes up.
These neo-ninja possessed enough augmented senses and jacked-up reflexes
to make weaponry superfluous at close-quarters.

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees.

Main lighting died away to be replaced by a shifting array of
multi-coloured strobes mounted on the floor, gantry and ceiling.
Octagonal mirrored columns rose from the floor and began to rotate,
turning the chamber into a kaleidoscopic visual assault course. Frank
turned to face Hideo, drawing a handgun from the pocket of his coat. He
held his arms loosely by his sides, waiting.

Sara leaned in close to me, her tone conspiratorial. "What <i>is</i> he
carrying? It didn't show up on our weapons scan."

"A gas-powered needlegun. Ceramic and plastic, firing glass
projectiles."

She paused for a moment, frowning, as if listening to an internal voice.
Then she laughed and clapped her hands. "Oh, oh, a <i>themed</i>
robbery! We
haven't had one of those since The Joker and may I say how much we
appreciate the effort, <i>Mister Cornelius</i>."

I inclined my head by way of acknowledgment. "This setting is also a
tribute, and one no less obscure. Now, I'll sit this out, if you don't
mind. Frank is the one for the rough-stuff."

"Oh, absolutely. Although you do realise you'll share your brother's
fate?" She frowned. "Is he really your sibling?"

"Him? Christ, not even close, but we work well together. As to sharing
his fate, well, I wouldn't have it any other way." I sipped my
champagne.

Sara raised her voice. "Hideo, you may begin."

Hideo bowed. 

Frank pointed his gun at a spot three meters to Hideo's left, then seven
meters, then four meters to his right. His arm fell to his side.

Hideo's expression didn't change but his stance altered, almost
imperceptibly.

Frank pointed his gun at a spot five meters to Hideo's right, then six
to his left. His arm fell to his side.

Sara sounded more confused than concerned. "What <i>is</i> he doing? Is
it some
kind of ritual?"

I shook my head. "Frank is pointing at the positions, in sequence, where
your man planned to be."

"I don't understand. How is that possible?"

"I don't understand it either, but that's his singular talent. In combat
situations, where he's directly threatened, Frank can predict the
actions of his adversary."

Hideo bowed again, then turned and walked away, immediately lost
from view amidst the visual cacophony.

Now Sara sounded nervous. "What's going on? He can't simply leave."

"He's been defeated and is acknowledging that fact. No matter what he
does, no matter how random his movements, Frank will nail Hideo before
he gets within reach."

Frank's arm snapped up and he fired off to his right; the
<i>twee-twee-twee</i>
of a three-round burst barely audible. The columns ceased rotating and
descended. The strobes cut out, to be replaced by main lighting.

A small, crumpled, khaki figure lay on the decking.

I sighed. "He had to try, I suppose, even though he knew it was a futile
gesture. Failure in his line of work isn't habit forming." Frank
giggled, spun the needlegun on his finger, and returned it to his
pocket. I stood up, placed my glass on the table and retrieved my cane.

Sara's face registered surprise and anger before settling for a forced
smile. "Congratulations, gentlemen. It would be churlish of me not to
honour the terms of our agreement, even if it was only a rumour.
Therefore, to the victors, the spoils. So please take whatever you can
carry and depart, with my blessing."

I twisted the silver top of my swordstick, unlocking the blade. With one
draw-and-slash I severed Sara's throat, right through to the spinal
cord. Her head fell back, dangling down the back of the sofa, secured to
the torso by only a few tendons and strip of skin. Blood fountained,
causing me to step away.

Frank chewed his bottom lip. "Messy. You should have let me plug her."

"No disrespect, man, but I had to make sure of taking out her central
nervous system." I walked around to the far side of the sofa and lopped
off the top of Sara's skull. "Come look." He edged around the spreading
blood pool and peered at the dull-blue crystal lattice I'd uncovered. I
gestured with my swordstick. "Frank, meet Lucien Ghent."

He sniffed. "So he's not Roth then? You were taking one hell of a risk."

"Not Roth, he's got all the finesse of a fist, and Ghent himself was
never that direct. As I said, Sara can come and go as she pleases - a
classic case of hiding in plain sight."

Frank stooped and picked up a handful of emeralds, letting them drop
slowly through his fingers. "We could just take the money and run."

"True." I placed my fingertips on the lattice, interfacing with the
neural net. "But why clean out the till when you can steal the entire
bank? Ghent may be gone but I can access the firmware femininity
protocols that he used as Sara. With these and my drugs I can morph into
a facsimile of her, one good enough to fool even Roth. Well, for as long
as it takes to dispose of him."

Frank grinned. "And what if he's shagging her? I'd love to see your face
if he starts cozying up in private."

"Trust you to think of that, but somehow I don't see Ghent canoodling
with the hired help." I sniffed. "Anyway, he's not my type."

"Oh yeah? Wait until you've put your chromosomes through the wringer,
then tell me you don't fancy a piece of rough like our man Arturo."

"Enough, already!" I walked around and slit Sara's blouse open. The head
of the eWurm had already emerged from her navel. "Biomass technology,
the cutting edge in living machinery. With this I can control the ship,
and everything in it, just like she did."

My companion-in-crime made a face. "Creepy. You really going to let that
thing inside you?"

I eased the interface free of the corpse and unbuttoned my waistcoat and
shirt. "Damn straight. It needs a living host to survive and is too
simplistic to support any concept of loyalty to Ghent." I held the eWurm
against my stomach and felt it start to burrow in.

Frank went pale and took a step back. Despite his propensity for
violence he can be quite squeamish at times.

The pain made me grimace but I kept talking, albeit through clenched
teeth. "I've run the financials. Ghent funds his lifestyle, the
Scaramanga, from the corporate 'Discretionary' account - it takes a
small percentage of the net profits from his investments. With Roth out
of the way I can steadily increase the percentage draw-down and the
automated accountancy routines will do the rest."

"Yeah, yeah - but how long will <i>that</i> take? Before we came aboard
it was
a case of you becoming this dude and cleaning him out in nothing flat.
Now we have to wait while you liquidise assets <i>and</i> off Roth as
well?
What happened to 'easy in, easy out', or is my memory playing tricks?"

The pain began to ease and I squared my shoulders. "Look, man, you've
got the attention span of a retarded goldfish. If I'd said this was
going to take weeks, maybe even months, would you have been interested
in the big picture? No, you wouldn't. Instead we'd be on our way out of
here with a fortune in our pockets and a price on our heads. Or do you
really think we can kill someone like Lucien Ghent and walk away
scot-free?"

Frank plucked at his bottom lip, a petulant gesture of his. "You were
the one who sliced him, her, whatever. He was willing to let us go."

I sneered at him. "Yeah, right. His type are all smiling bonhomie, right
up to the instant they start losing. We'd have walked off the ship into
a hail of gunfire, courtesy of Roth's little army."

"Still-"

"Still nothing. Look, this way I convert everything to bearer bonds and
then its Core systems, here we come. First-class all the way, no expense
spared."

He gestured to the wealth on display. "What about all this, then? We
just leave it behind?"

"Even if it's real I bet it's tagged in some way, traceable. Anyway,
it's just a drop in the bucket compared to what Ghent's investments are
worth." I tossed him my cane. "Now, I hate long goodbyes, so PISS OFF!"

Frank grinned, gave me the finger, and walked away. I called out after
him. "Hang on, you gonna' keep up the 'Frank' persona or what?"

"Not sure, but you can leave a message for me with Crank, he'll know who
you mean. See if you were my older brother, though, I'd have killed you
years ago."

"See if you were my younger brother, you'd never have been born."

He laughed and left the chamber. I sat down, feeling the ships systems
starting to impinge on my consciousness. It was strange, like standing
in a familiar room and realizing there were far more doors leading off
it than before. The housekeeping crawlers would dispose of the bodies
and clean the place up. I'd transition into Sara so that the next time
Roth came calling he'd be dead long before realizing anything was wrong.
Or maybe I'd dump Arturo in our vest-pocket Madeira and let him go
native, lord of all he surveyed.

I smiled and lifted a glass of champagne. All in all this was going to
be a very tasty world.

A very tasty world, indeed.

<p class="drop">Where was I during Woodstock?  
Well, people ask me that from time to time, brother.  I’ve never been 
able to tell the story ‘til now.

No shit, there I was on the plains of
Abyssinia in a blacked-out Cobra
Jet Torino GT with Raul Castro, Goldie Hawn, and 130 bottles of Havana
Club 7 Años, running balls-to-the-wall, flat-out for Bossangoa without
a moment to spare. It was 16 August, we were due in B-town on the
18th, and even the fact that we'd just saved Haile Selassie's life the
night before from yet another assassination attempt by Japanese
non-consensual Morris dancing fundamentalists didn't mean that His
Imperial Majesty would look kindly on uncustomed liquors on his
nation's highways and byways. 

We had to move, and quick, but luckily
Goldie'd had that Cobra Jet polished, ported, tuned in and turned on at
Timothy Leary's machine shop the week before. That was back when
Leary was building for all the khat co-ops' 'leggers out of Hargeisa,
back before those fucking reactionaries ran him out of town and he
ended up building his famous eight-circuit carbs for Lancia, not that
the cowards ever had the balls to run those cars until Group B came
along, but you show me an Italian who understands psychedelic induction
and I'll show you a Nixon who can dance convincingly to Louie Louie. 

Unlucky for me, Raul'd already drank three bottles since breakfast, and
whenever he mixes hard liquor and dex, the man gets amorous. Goldie'd
made it abundantly clear that she needed both hands and every
one of her feet to drive, so that left me fending off the generalissimo
in the back seat while also managing the watches and the map. Well,
we were flying by a pair of twin-barrel Breguets that had never run
quite right since I'd stolen them back from Alan Haber, as the maniac
had converted the pair into what he called a chronobong, and I was
still picking seeds out of the isochronous balance springs when I'd put
them back together that morning. Between that and Castro's hand down
my pants, we zigged a meter late and Goldie took that beast straight
into the savannah. 

"Fuck it, Marbles," she said, Marbles being what
all the Laugh-In crowd called me at the time, "Give me bearing and
altitude. We're gonna crow-fly this sonofabitch." 

Now I knew enough
to know not to argue with Goldie when she'd been mainlining STP for
more than twelve days running, so I called out her numbers and she
engaged the transspatial overdrive Leary'd bolted in. 

<div class=lpullquote>The best protection in a collision is a good drunk
on and no seatbelt</div>Well,
friend, I
tell you, never trust a Berkeley man's rear end work, at least not in
more than four dimensions, because we were just a dick-hair shy of
redline when that 3.91 Traction-Lok gave way and dissolved into a
chorus of gerbils singing "Nearer My God To Thee," sending us spinning
right back into square space-time. 

Now Goldie had nerve, and she had
the skills, the girl made Jackie Stewart look like Gerald Ford behind
the wheel, but there's only so much you can do in a Torino GT in the
Abyssinian grass at Mach 2, running factory radials. She pitched
left, we spiked it and went airborne. Goldie almost got it back when
a gerbil lodged in the starboard aileron and we lost attitude, going
back in hard. 

It's true what they say, friends, that the best
protection in a collision is a good drunk on and no seatbelt, because
Raul was already legging it over the next rise with a bottle when the
ambo scooped me off the ground. 

Goldie was nowhere to be seen, but I
finally ran into her at a party at Red Skelton's fuck-shack in '72, and
she said she'd been thrown clear and lodged like a spear in the wall of
the green room at a Son House show in Munich. House pried her loose
after the encore and she said he taught her to finally appreciate
bourbon. She dropped the drugs cold turkey and quit 'legging, too. 
She'd only ever been in it for the action, didn't need the money, and
the whole era was coming to a close by then anyway. 

It was all over
by Altamont, and there I was, still in the hospital recuperating. Of
course, you can imagine my consternation when Raul showed up in a wig
and a nurse's outfit. Say what you will about their macroeconomics,
the Castros have always been <i>very insistent lovers</i>. 

But
that's another story, friends, for another time.

[*ITEM] The Man with Bronze Hair

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB]  "Roots are not in landscape or a country, or a people, they
are inside you." <small>Isabel Allende</small>

		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">A
few of those involved in the unauthorized landscaping in Smatparrox
knew the bronze-haired man as Farras Grein.  They were
well-motivated, and knew better than to discuss either their work or
his identity with strangers.  They were also well-paid, but this was
incidental to the satisfaction afforded by the importance of what
they jointly aimed to achieve.  There was good reason for the secrecy
of their activities.</P>

Rural
hamlets are sometimes described as &lsquo;sleepy&rsquo;.  Smatparrox,
sadly, was comatose.  It was not an unattractive place, but its
amenities had been allowed to decline until the liveliest local
feature was the traffic on the bypass. It was a place from which
those in search of education, work, health-care or public
entertainment were obliged to commute, provided they could safely
negotiate the potholes in the roads.  An oppressive bureaucracy clung
like a suffocating miasma over the workings of Smatparrox Council. 
Any threat to the <i>status quo</i> would set in motion a host of
defensive
measures, supported by ancient statute ready to be cited with
wearying detail by their overstaffed legal department.  It was one of
the hangovers from feudal times which had so far resisted any attempt
at modernisation, along with the rest of that sorry place.

<div class=pullquote>"It will shock them into wakefulness"</div>With
eight years of research behind him, and the results overwhelmingly
positive, the man who called himself Farras Grein was impatient to
implement his plan.  Knowing that overt action would have been met
with petty obstructions, he had carefully recruited a trustworthy
group with knowledge of the local terrain and an enthusiasm for the
project.  He intended to present Smatparrox with a <I>fait
accompli</I>.

Fortunately, a minimum of equipment was required for their nocturnal
operations,
so the chances of detection were reduced.  Essentially, all that was
needed for each procedure was a grid reference and a means of digging
a precise cluster of holes.  Careful insertion of the seeding and
nutrient-release mechanism would then be followed by any necessary
camouflage of the resulting mound.

Although
the clandestine planters were never actually observed, inexplicable
signs of disturbance to the faded municipal flower-beds or other
public spaces were blamed on moles, until the curiously regular
distribution of the mounds was eventually noticed.  Suspecting some
kind of sabotage, and fearful of hidden traps, the Council belatedly
called for an investigative team from Snoak.

Snoak
citizens rarely had cause, or indeed sufficient interest to visit
Smatparrox.  The Snoak Detechs were still pursuing their own urban
anomalies, and could not be spared, but on learning that it was a
landscape-related matter, Central thought it would do no harm to
provide a few under-employed cartographers, who might conceivably
benefit from an aerial view of the ground.

By
that time Farras Grein's biotaps had already begun to interlock their
root system, and were rising to greet the sun.

Biotaps
were in effect artificial trees, the product of research and
development at the Quicksilver laboratories in Snoak City, the same
scientific stable which had achieved success with SunCell MonoPods. 
They were self-regulating energy-storage and conversion devices which
used an enhanced form of photosynthesis to yield a high degree of
efficiency with no harmful by-products.

The
man known as Farras Grein was himself a native of Smatparrox, and it
had long been among his ambitions to be a catalyst for change in what
many regarded as that provincial backwater.  The provision of
virtually free energy could only be a change for the better.  He had
said as much to his beautiful voluntary cohab and confidante, Sarsel
Bridge4th, the herpetologist, whom he had met at a conference on
solar energy and biosystems, where he had been greatly impressed by
her paper (<I>&lsquo;Spectrometric Analysis of UVB Transmission in
Reptilian Chemotaxis&rsquo;</I> ) before it struck him that she was
also a very attractive woman.

&quot;It will shock them into wakefulness, Pi,&quot; she had said, the
night he had first told her about the project.  &quot;And not before
time. 
It's the fresh start they've been needing.  But are you ready to take
the credit when the demand for biotaps turns global?  Even you won&rsquo;t
be able to keep this scheme of yours from attracting world-wide
attention.  The publicity is bound to become very persistent.&quot;

What
was not generally known about Farras Grein was that he and
Quicksilver's reclusive founder, Pion Octyl diMotz, were one and the
same.  He had paused before answering, granting her one of his
enigmatic smiles.  &quot;That remains to be seen, my love. 
Meanwhile, I rather look forward to the excitement of escaping from
the confines of the lab.&rdquo;   A mischievous thought occurred to
him.  &ldquo;We could venture out incognito.  You can help me choose
a suitable disguise, and we&rsquo;ll give the Quanderpyre press
something else to gossip about.  Shall we sleep on it?&rdquo;

Sarsel
had unclipped the exquisite gold snake bracelet which he had bought
her from Smigs in Yarp Street, and turned to him with a giggle that
some would have been surprised to hear from the lips of such a
reputable scientist.

<p class=drop>There was no question about the biotaps’ efficiency.  They
had been programmed to optimize their performance, drawing radiant and
chemical sustenance from air and earth.  Their roots developed
protective sheathing, formed junctions from which small quasi-metallic
tubers rose to ground level, from where they emitted enticing
pheromones.  On the gently questing stems of each main trunk, the shiny
leaf-blades flashed, sucking in photons, strengthening the
pseudo-plant’s defensive capabilities.  Here and there little blobs and
heaps of organic matter continued to be absorbed, the remains, perhaps,
of unwary wildlife.  Under one particular biotap, of the thousands that
now occupied what was once Smatparrox, close to a slowly liquefying
visor, a few wiry strands of bronze hair had already been half swallowed
by the rapacious soil.

[*ITEM] The Log of the Mustang Sally - Tazio

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB]  "The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be
the philosophy of government in the next." <small> Abraham
Lincoln</small>

		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>Tazio slid the long card into the wall slot.
A
multicoloured ribbon cable led from the card to Tazio's handheld device.
LEDs flashed. A	dull click came from the depths of the white door, and
after a pause, accompanied by a sigh of long-unused hydraulics and a
crack of silicone
seals, the door slid open a few centimetres, checked briefly, then
retracted into the wall of the corridor. For a fifteen year-old kid,
Tazio
was good with keys. Good with electronics generally.

A waft of cold, sharply-flavoured air, smelling faintly of plastic and
light oil, issued from the dark space beyond. The air in these pods was
somehow refreshing. Only whenever he returned to the main ship did he
realise that the Mustang Sally always smelled like a latrine. Yet none
of the fifty thousand inhabitants of the star ship were particularly
aware of it. The aroma was a side-effect of the constant requirement to
recycle everything... absolutely everything.

Fluorescent tubes buzzed and blinked, illuminating a white corridor. A
mushroom-shaped button was flashing just inside. With ease born of
practice, Tazio retrieved his home-made access card, and entered. He
struck
the button, and the door behind him slid shut. Motors hummed, his ears
popped, then the door at the far end of the corridor clicked, and a
green light came on above it. Tazio trotted to the door, which was
labelled
'Mustang Sally Pod K6', pulled a lever and pushed the door open. He
stepped into the brightly-illuminated space beyond. The room was crowded
with white-cased machinery, black acceleration couches, brushed
stainless steel controls, and inert display panels. He turned and pushed
the door closed, then popped open a nearby panel in the floor and
flipped a switch off. The main lights went out, leaving only the faint
red glow of emergency lamps and LEDs.

<div
class=pullquote>"You don't have to break into a landing pod to see the
view."</div>At the far end of the pod, a circular transparent blister of
thick glass
would offer a pod pilot a forward view on landing. Currently, it was
covered on the outside with a protective iris, so that it would not
become eroded by exposure to possible particles of dust. Moving quickly,
Tazio attached his Gripsafe camera mount to a convenient grab bar in the
viewport, attached the camera, an ancient Panasonic that had belonged to
his grandmother, and verified that it could be pointed in any direction.

He pressed the switch to open the viewport cover, and, as usual,
experienced a thrill of vertigo at the depth of space. Despite the size
of Mustang Sally, the longest internal views were measured in hundreds
of metres, rather than light years. He pressed the video start button to
make a test.
 
Tazio was currently invading a landing pod destined to be used for the
first time in some 190 years. His grandchildren's descendants might one
day pilot a landing pod. Until then, the pods were strictly out of
bounds.

Starting the second scan, with the camera turning on the automatic drive
he had built, Tazio felt, rather than heard, a whisper of air movement,
and
the lights went on, dazzling him temporarily with the reflection from
the curved viewport.

In the doorway behind him stood a compact woman in uniform. Kay-Zee
Jones - specifically Master-at-Arms Jones - with whom Tazio was,
regrettably, all too familiar.

Brazened it out: "Hi, Kay-Zee, switch off that light, will you? I'm just
working on my astrophysics project."

"You know you're not allowed in here. How did you get in, anyway?"

"Door was open."

"These doors are never open, and you know it. What have you touched?
Other than two airlock doors, light switches and the viewport cover
plate, that is."

"Nothing! Just fixed up the camera here, see?"

"Right. Close the viewport and let's go. Why do I keep finding you in
areas you're not supposed to be in? I'm taking you to the Lieutenant
this time."

Tazio considered making a protest, but he decided it would be safer to
obey orders and hope for leniency. Detached the equipment and followed
her meekly from the landing pod. Hoping that no-one would conficate his
access card. It'd take a month to scrounge the parts for another.

"Why are you in here? And in the dark?" 

"To photograph the stars. I use the viewport."

"You don't have to break into a landing pod for that. You can get an
accurate image of the stars from the nav database, adjusted for our
speed, accessible from your cabin screen. What's the real reason?"

"Yes, I know, but the actual stars themselves are more interesting."

"How can they be? They're just dots of light. Anyway, you don't have to
break into a landing pod to see the view."

"I do. There aren't any viewports anywhere else."

He was right. There were no viewports on the main hull of the ship. It
had been considered bad for morale to allow the crew to see the void
around them. Automatic machinery checked star positions continuously and
made microscopic course corrections, without the need for crew
involvement. When necessary, navigation officers might engage one of the
external cameras if the on-board computers warned of nearby dust or
debris.

"You've been into other pods, haven't you?" she said.

"One or two." There were dozens of landing pods attached to the vast
interstellar ship, each with a viewport. Tazio had visited many of them,
taking his photographs and videos. The landing pods, being set at
different angles on Mustang Sally's kilometres-long network of
cylinders, offered different views, and Tazio had photographed the
starscape from each pod he had visited.

"Come here. Let's go."

You could be right, but I can't see inside. They built those ships to
last. The hull is mostly thick ferrous metal. They had no force field
technology when Mustang Sally set sail. All I can say is that the
engines are still running and the temperature of the hull is consistent
with human life. It normally shows no lights at all, but I just saw
lights going off and on inside what must be a lifeboat or something. I
showed myself nearby, but nothing much happened since. By the way, they
launched a missile a while ago, but it may have been an auto intended to

<p class=drop>Rather than call an auto-b'n'w, Kay-Zee decided it would
be quicker to walk along corridor K until they were below Patrol HQ, and
then use the companionway. She set off briskly, pulling Tazio by one
arm. He protested and dragged his heels at first, but the pain
occasioned by Kay-Zee insisting on her own pace persuaded him to trot to
keep up.

"Why are you called Kay-Zee?" he asked. She ignored this attempt at
conversation. Tazio stumbled as they crossed the area of warped corridor
floor where enthusiastic officers had tried, unsuccessfully, to
incinerate one of Turner's 'dwarves'.

"Keep up!" she snapped, irritated with her parents, once again, for
having frivolously named her after a 20th century movie actress,
Katherine Zeta Jones, for heaven's sake. "What sort of a name is Tazio,
anyway?"

"My father named me after a twentieth century motor racer called Tazio
Nuvolari."

Annoyed as she was, Kay-Zee would probably have carried out her threat
to take Tazio before her superior officer, for the kid's own sake, if
for no other reason. He was running wild. Tazio's mother was dead, his
father was desperately busy, with countless responsibilities. Mustang
Sally was basically an unarmed passenger ship, though under military
command, but it was still bristling with levers, switches, handles and
buttons that could cause all sorts of trouble for law-enforcement and
danger to curious kids like Tazio. A day or two in 'irons' (actually a
cabin that locked from the outside, most usually used for brawlers fired
up on illicit alcohol) might do him a favour.

As it happened, that possibly laudable objective went by the board when
her communicator buzzed in her ear. "Yes!" she almost shouted.

"Where are you, Kay-Zee?" Lieutenant Parsons.

"Corridor K, five minutes from HQ, sir."

"OK. I'm sending an auto-b'n'w now. What're you doing?"

"Bringing in a juvenile."

"Surprise me. Tazio again?"

"You got it."

"OK. Release him for the time being. You can always re-arrest him. He's
not going anywhere. Suspicious death in storage bay 17. Holt's in
charge. Attend."

"I hear you. I'll let him go."

Tazio was smirking. He had overheard everything. Kay-Zee glared back,
"Keep your nose clean, kid. Final warning."

The black and white autocab was beside them now. Kay-Zee pulled open the
cab door, temporarily transforming the huge POLICE label on the
vehicle's side to LICE.  "Can I come too?" asked Tazio.

"Get lost!" she said, attempting to slam the lightweight plastic door,
which failed to make the satisfyingly loud noise she would have liked,
but simply clicked anticlimactically.

When she arrived at the entrance to Bay 17, Lazarski was standing
outside the closed doors. His hair and uniform were wet. Lazarski didn't
address her. He called Holt on his comm unit, and Holt came out looking
shaken, which wasn't like him. He was wet, too, his uniform showing dark
patches. Holt wasn't telling her anything either. He assigned Kay-Zee to
"Move Along, Nothing To See Here" duties in the corridor outside, and
went back in with Lazarski. They exchanged a few quiet words. She heard
Holt say "They're not going to believe this."

Kay-Zee was irritated at the secrecy, and at the menial duty she'd been
given. People seemed to have heard that the death was 'suspicious'. A
cluster of the curious chatted quietly nearby.  Death was not unusual on
the ship. There were tens of thousands of crew on the Mustang Sally.
Three or four people died every day, mostly retired crew members taking
voluntary euthanasia, tidily. A few suicides, not so tidily. The
remainder were diseases of old age, accidents, fatal victims of fights
and family violence. She guessed this must be an unsightly bizarre
accident that Holt wanted to protect her from, which was both courteous
and insulting.

Tazio joined the spectators remarkably soon after Kay-Zee's arrival.
"What's happening, Kay-Zee?"

"None of your business. Go home and try to stay out of trouble for an
hour or two."

After twenty minutes or so, an auto-ambulance arrived. She called Holt.
Holt told her to send it away. "What's going on?" she asked.

"OK. Come in here and lock the doors behind you."

The bay was brightly lit. It was a storage-only bay, and very cold.
There was a strong smell of burning, and the floor was wet. Holt and
Lazarski were standing talking. She could see the lower half of a body
lying on the floor. It appeared to be dressed in a yellow overall.

"OK? Up here. Holt led the way up an iron ladder to the second level.
Lazarski followed. On
the floor was a bundle of yellow clothes, but a photographer was in the
way.

"What..?"

Lazarski said: "Don't go getting sick. It's not real."

"It's real enough," corrected Holt. "It's just not human. It's an
android. Sliced neatly in half, one on each level. No blood, just wires,
plastic and this jelly stuff, which stinks when it catches fire, by the
way. The top half was trying to talk when we got here, but it's burnt
out now. The smoke detector went off and the door closed, we nearly
choked on carbon dioxide before Jerzy here sprung the entry override and
meanwhile the fire sprinkler got us. Fused the victim."

"What did it say?"

"Nothing we could understand. Anyway, we're finished here. It's up to
the laboratory to figure it out. It's probably one of their crazy
experiments, anyway. They're on their way."

Holt and Lazarski left Kay-Zee guarding the corridor. She let the
photographer out and the lab team in, then Lieutenant Parsons sent a
cadet to
replace her. She wasn't even asked to write a report.

<p class=drop>When the auto-ambulance was sent away, Tazio had concluded
that nothing interesting was going to happen at Bay 17. He returned to
his cabin to check out the camera footage.

His cabin barely offered room for his bed. Cabins for juveniles and
unmarried personnel were a standard three metre cube. The area above his
bunk was covered in a montage of starfield photos, making a composite
image of the visible sphere around the Mustang Sally, lacking only the
view to the rear of the interstellar ship, which was obscured by the
vast engines and the material recycling chambers, and directly ahead,
which was blocked by the debris screen which was intended to stop or
slow up any interstellar matter before it hit the ship proper.

The remaining space was crammed from deck to deckhead with equipment. 

Tazio was looking for a specific star. A star glimpsed just twice moving
across the field of view. It made no sense. All the other stars, if they
moved perceptibly, moved very slowly backwards with respect to the
ship's motion, because the Mustang Sally was now travelling at a speed
of nearly 30000 kilometres a second, having taken 185 years to achieve
this speed with the relatively tiny but steady acceleration of her
efficient ion drive engines. Shortly, she would rotate, and start to
slow down by pushing in the opposite direction. Then 194 years after
that, she would reach her first port of call - a potentially habitable
planet. The journey was an enterprise of hope, which would take
generations to complete.

He downloaded the camera to his computer and viewed the vids. The first
seemed uneventful, but, to be on the safe side, he ran a comparator
program he had written. The program slavishly compared the new vid with
a similar one from a different viewport. A couple of apparent anomalies
turned out to be reflections from the viewport. The star fields, where
they corresponded, were identical, within the limits of camera
resolution.

The second vid, the one interrupted by Kay-Zee's arrival, showed a brief
flash just prior to Kay-Zee activating the lights. Tazio initially
attributed that to reflected light from the corridor as Kay-Zee entered,
but, on close inspection, it appeared to occur even before Kay-Zee
opened the airlock door. Frame by frame, it was not a flash as such. On
three consecutive frames, an object moved across the field of view.
Motion blur made it impossible to distinguish details, but it occupied
about ten degrees of arc, making it either vastly bigger than any star -
an unlikely outcome - or quite close to the viewport. Unprecedented, but
unarguable.

It could, of course, have been a maintenance EVAV. They were quite
frequent, but if so, they should have been registered with EVA control.
According to the EVA control page, they weren't. No-one had booked out
today. Didn't mean no-one was out there. After all, Tazio himself had
failed to log his own visit to the pod.

He had already planned what to do. He risked paying another visit to the
pod with his camera and handheld, and returned later, empty-handed. His
father was still not in his cabin next door, so he started to watch a
movie and fell asleep in his clothes.

Yes. It quit sub-ether transmission immediately. No further result so

<hr />
<p class=drop>Kay-Zee heard no more of the android case. It was no
longer, apparently, a police matter. Her questions to Lieutenant Parsons
went unanswered. Further, she was ordered not to communicate any details
of the case to anyone, not even to colleagues.

She spent several days investigating thefts from the hydroponic jungle
where all of the food for the ship was grown. It turned out to be an
inside job, a worker trading fresh fruit for illegal alcohol. The
various beer, wine and spirit operations on the ship were tolerated,
rather than authorised, as long as they used waste rather than fresh
food as their ingredients. It had turned out to be impossible to
eradicate man's desire for occasional intoxication.

When that was cleared up, Lieutenant Parsons told her to do something
about Tazio. Accordingly, she asked Idoru (who saw everything and said
nothing unless specifically requested) to report any landing pod event.
Being a computer with a literal turn of mind, Idoru accordingly reported
dozens of trivial incidents such as tiny temperature changes or
microscopic analyses of air quality until Kay-Zee specified door
incidents. She hadn't long to wait. Pod K6 again, the port
entry signal accompanied
by an image of Tazio advancing through the airlock.

By the time Kay-Zee reached K6 and entered, the pod was empty. Tazio
hadn't been there long. She went immediately to Tazio's cabin, but
no-one answered the door. She returned to HQ and requested a supervisory
view on her vidscreen. The spycam in Tazio's cabin revealed him hunched
over his computer.

She got hold of a skeleton card, walked over to Tazio's cabin, and
entered. "Well, the look on your face when I walked in was worth the
trouble I took."

"No, look, Kay-Zee. I 've caught a spacecraft on camera. Just a little
one, see."

"Yes. You've been caught on camera, too. Entering the landing pod
again. That's it. This time you are going to be dealt with. Lieutenant
Parsons has been in touch with your father, who agreed that you have to
be punished for messing about in the landing pods."

"Please, Kay-Zee, I've got the proof. Look at this."

Despite herself, Kay-Zee looked at Tazio's screen. It was clearly a
spacecraft, but what a spacecraft! It looked like every boy's dream of a
spacecraft, its basically streamlined body surmounted by blisters, pods,
weaponry, aerials and, especially, insignia - huge black symbols and
numbers on its creamy-coloured hull.

"How?"

"I put the camera on time delay, taking a frame every fifteen seconds
until the chip was full. I've got ten or more pictures of it, but this
is the best!"

"Good try, Tazio. Very realistic. It's a model, right? Now, let's go. We
have an appointment with Lieutenant Parsons."

"No, Kay-Zee, it's real! Wait till I show Dad."

"In your own time, Tazio. I won't ask again. I seem to spend half my
life chasing after you."

<p class=drop>Kay-Zee left Tazio with Lieutenant Parsons.  The
Lieutenant had devised what he felt to be a suitable punishment for
Tazio. He was to be given a sharp lecture, then locked up for
twenty-four hours in a landing pod.  Kay-Zee privately considered that
Tazio would regard this as a reward, but she said nothing. She offered
to stay for the interview, but she was near the end of her watch, and by
the next day, a body had turned up, this one impaled on a metal pipe in
recycling.

This time, Kay-Zee was first on the scene, with Wally Khan as backup.
Liquid Waste Distribution 1 was an odorous chamber, cold, badly lit and
echoing. A metal pipe ran from a bulkhead into a cylindrical unit, which
presumably separated liquids and gases that flowed into half a dozen
different exit pipes. <div class=pullquote>"You had better make sure
your boy keeps his mouth shut."</div>The apparently male victim,
bland-faced, dressed
in an orange overall, was held in place by the pipe passing through his
abdomen, oozing the jelly she had seen on the android in Bay 17, but it
appeared singularly composed under the circumstances. There was no
conceivable way in which he could have been threaded on to the pipe -
one end of the pipe was attached to the bulkhead, the other to the
processing cylinder. What's more, according to the shocked recycling
tech, the pipe was blocked internally. It was as though the body had
materialised in its current position. Kay-Zee reported via her comm that
it was another android. The android was talking after a fashion, very
quietly. The language was clearly English with a peculiar accent, the
delivery was confused, and the content included a desire to make contact
and offering help of some kind.

Kay-Zee switched on her shoulder cam to record as much as possible, but
the flow of words became quieter and more garbled, and, by the time the
lab team arrived to cut the android loose, all signs of animation had
ceased.

Even while she and Wally were preparing their report, the lieutenant,
despite the late hour, appeared on site.

"No report on this, Kay-Zee, Wally. I have been instructed from the
highest authority to keep the lid on it."

"Highest authority?" said Kay-Zee.

"The captain, OK? No reports. No discussion with colleagues, family,
friends. Forget it. Completely."

"Got it," said Wally.

"Got it. But what is it? Some experiment?" said Kay-Zee.

"When I said 'No Discussion', it includes asking me. In fact, I have no
idea. Unlike you, I obey orders. Can I impress on you that it's a
secret, and no-one needs to know."

"Aye, aye, sir."

<p class=drop>But, of course, Captain Raymond needed to know, and what
he knew or suspected was that aliens were attempting to invade the ship,
probably to kill everyone, and certainly to divert the Mustang Sally
from her objective. The following morning, he was impressing the need
for secrecy on his second-in-command, Commander Rydell.

Rydell was not so sure: "But, Captain, there are scores of people who
know part of the story already. The police, half of the lab staff,
Navigation. And here's the worst. That craft Navigation detected? My son
managed to take photographs of it."

"What?"

"It's OK. I convinced him it was a scout ship of our own. Top secret.
He'll not tell anyone."

"Good"

"Tazio is just one witness. Rumours are already circulating, sir. Tazio
was just outside Bay 17 when the first android was discovered. Now we've
had a second. And the same Master-at-Arms was present at both. She
even videoed the second one. We extracted it, and the lab are checking
it out. It's deleted from the mainframe. But we can't
keep it confidential much longer. What we can understand of the
android's message seems peaceful."

"No, no. They'd be sure to tell us that. For all we know, they've
already invaded Earth. We may be the only hope for mankind. If they
were actually human, they'd have sent a human emissary, not a robot
pretending to be a human. In any
event, there would be panic on board. Just think. Their technology must
be
vastly superior to ours. Look how they completely ignored that missile.
There are thousands on the Mustang who expect to spend the rest of their
days in relative peace. Including me. How would they react if these
aliens suddenly appeared among them?"

"I think they'd handle it pretty well, if they were warned in advance.
They don't get much excitement in the normal course of events."

"No, Commander, I think there's a good chance these aliens will lose
interest if we don't react. It's just a small craft. We are huge. They
have no idea what we're capable of."

"Not a lot, from the military point of view, sir."

"Granted. But they don't know that. It's not worth their while to
challenge us."

"It encourages me that they send humanoid robots that speak English.
That doesn't sound unfriendly."

"That's enough, Commander. You have my orders and you had better make
sure your boy keeps his mouth shut. No-one is to speak of it.
Understand?"

"Aye-aye, sir." The expression 'Aye-aye', infrequently used these days,
had come to mean 'I obey, but I don't like it'. If Captain Raymond
noticed the potential insubordination, he made no sign of it.

<p class=drop>Tazio was, as Kay-Zee predicted, entirely comfortable in
the landing pod. It was hardly a prison. Had he chosen, Tazio could have
used his experience with pod electronics to escape. Instead, he
opened the viewport, sat in the pilot's chair, and searched the
firmament for spacecraft. He had just perceived a twinkling reflection
at extreme distance, when he heard a woman's voice behind him. He swung
around and jumped up with a guilty start. Surely Kay-Zee hadn't followed
him here. But it wasn't Kay-Zee. He had never seen her before. She was
tall, thin, dark-haired, dressed in a simple one-piece overall.

At first, he couldn't make out what she was saying. A strange accent, he
couldn't quite...

"What did you say?"

"My name is Lem. What's yours?"

"I.. I.. Tazio Rydell? What are you doing here?"

"What is your age, Tazio?"

"I'm fifteen. Who are you? I don't think you should be here. I'm
supposed to be locked in." He was not precisely alarmed, but confused
and worried.

"I need to speak to your captain. Can you take me there?"

"No. I'm not allowed out. Well, I could, but I'd be in trouble. If
you've got a key to get in, you can get out again. I haven't got a key."

"I haven't got a key either."

"Well, did someone lock you in, like me?"

"I didn't come in by the door."

"It's the only way."

"No, it's not."

Tazio began to suspect the woman was deranged, like the mother of one of
his school friends, who had run around the corridors with a
knife screaming that the devil was inside her, until she was led off to
the hospital. Deranged people, he had heard, could be dangerous. There
was no other way into a landing pod. "How did you get in, then?"

"I was displaced. From another spacecraft."

"The little one that I've seen? What is 'displaced'?" Input overload.

"It's a method of moving an object from one location to another by... by
a complicated method using quantum physics." She pointed out of the
viewport. The craft Tazio had photographed was holding position nearby.
"I'm from that one. It would be more true to say I <i>am</i> that
craft. The Stanislaw Lem. The Lem has no crew as such. It is operated
by an AI. I am the avatar of that AI, a robot which has the
personality of that AI."

"An AI - Artificial Intelligence! There are games about AIs."

"Are there really?"

"I can call my father. I'm allowed to do that."

"Who is your father?"

"He's a Commander. He works for Captain Raymond."

"Your father sounds exactly the person I should speak to. Can you call
him now?"

<hr /> <I><b>GQ Stanislaw Lem</b> to <b>HTW Iain M Banks</b><br />
5024008298663538</I><br /><tt>Success! Or, at least, so far so good. I
have an avatar aboard the Mustang Sally. A male juvenile was inside one
of the landing/rescue units with the viewport open. With visibility, I
was able to displace an avatar into the unit without hazard. The avatar
took the form of an adult female. I thought that would cause less alarm.
In the event, the child was quite sophisticated and has called the
authorities on board.</tt>

<hr /> <I><b>HTW Iain M Banks</b>
to <b>GQ Stanislaw Lem  </b><br /> 5024008263632052</I><br />
<tt>Well done. Keep me posted. Don't mention me until you have to.
Remember what happened with Blue Suede Shoes. Don't
reveal our full purpose until you're sure they won't panic.</tt> <hr />

<I><b>GQ Stanislaw Lem</b> to <b>HTW Iain M Banks</b><br />
5024008298663539</I><br /><tt>Yes. As agreed. We assert that we are here
to help if they need it, with stores, repairs, medical assistance. </tt>
<hr />

<p class=drop>Captain Raymond was looking haggard. Two weeks of
conversation with Lem, or, rather, with the avatar of Stanislaw Lem and
still he
didn't trust it. "I know you have been very helpful over these last few
weeks, and we thank you. These repairs and the updated electronics
will prove very useful. One thing puzzles me."

"And that is?"

"You know very well that you have constantly avoided explaining why you
are here, apparently alone."

Commander Rydell added "He's right. You say you came from Earth, yet
there are no human personnel with you. And the Stanislaw Lem is too
small to have sourced all the equipment and the robots that converted
the shield to a force field."

"I had expected to explain all this to you in due course. I have been
advised to be cautious in what I reveal."

"Why? Is there some hidden agenda here, as I suspect? said Raymond.

<div class=pullquote>"You should know that Earth is no longer
inhabited."</div>"By no means. It's just that we approached another
Earth star ship in a
less than diplomatic fashion, causing considerable distress to them, and
precipitating what amounted to panic, then what amounted to civil war
within the ship. A particularly extreme faction 
eventually forced the ship to self-destruct with the loss of all the
colonists."

"I see you used the expression 'we'. And that is supposed to reassure
us?"

"I feel it would be a terrible shock to you and your people if I were to
announce everything I have to say in public."

"Well," said Rydell, "The whole ship now knows you are here. There have
been guided tours to see the Stanislaw Lem from Tazio's viewport. Many
of the crew have now met you. I think you can, at any rate, depend on
the good impression you have made, except that you adroitly avoid any
discussion of your origin and intentions."

"Answering your questions in what I consider to be the appropriate
order, I shall be more open with you. I hope I have proved my good
intentions, and you must trust that I shall continue to speak and act in
your best interests."

"I suspect you <I>would</I> say that, whatever your motives. I have
never fully trusted you," grumbled Raymond.

"I agree with the Captain," said Rydell, "I was more prepared to trust
you at first than I am now. You must be aware that your adopted persona,
as an open, attractive and friendly female, has tended to turn away
hostility and suspicion in a way a male avatar might not have done."

Lem smiled. "All right. This may be a shock, though probably not a
surprise. You should know that Earth is no
longer inhabited. Its climatic collapse was expected before you left on
this mission.
Indeed that fear was the main reason for the star ships."

"And I suppose everyone is dead," said Raymond.

"Not so. The vast majority were re-housed in a suitable space habitat in
approximate Earth orbit. There were casualties; stay-behinds, panickers,
rioters, people too sick to survive, but most are safe and have been
settled for half a century. We arranged the necessary transport."

"A space habitat?" asked Rydell.

"Effectively a planet, but a different, more convenient shape. A ring,
rather than a sphere. I can offer details, but I have more news."

"What now?"

"I am, as you correctly guessed, not alone. We are accompanied at a
distance by what you might call
a mother ship, a Heavy Transport Workshop called Iain M Banks. The Banks
is mother to a thousand or more smaller vehicles, of which the Lem is
the smallest type. The docking hold alone of the Banks is large enough
to accommodate several craft as big as the Mustang Sally. It carries
armaments that could vaporise a planet. Indeed, the sight of Iain M
Banks caused the initial uproar in the generation ship Blue Suede Shoes.
Therefore, we
decided, on this occasion, to conduct a modest approach."

Commander Rydell looked dubious. "I don't believe Earth technology can
have advanced so far."

"You are correct. The race that created us a very long time ago were not
human. We AIs are effectively their descendants. They are not extinct;
some are aboard the Iain M Banks, as are a few hundred humans. But none
of them take any part in guiding our operations. This particular fleet
is dedicated to the well-being of the human race. It is a kind of hobby.
Every craft is named after an Earth-origin science fiction author."

"So you've been running around helping all the generation ships?"

"Most, I'm afraid, were beyond our help by the time we found them, but
yes."

"So you will nursemaid us to our destination?" asked Captain Raymond. 

"If you wish, but we have other proposals to offer you."

"I'm not sure I like the idea of any change to our mission."

"Even although its original purpose, to preserve the human species, has
been achieved with the space habitat? You could turn around and return
home. Alternatively, you could abandon the Mustang Sally and load your
crew on the Iain M Banks, which is essentially a world in itself. I can
assure you of a full and attractive	life for all your people."

Raymond did not hesitate. "My orders were clear. The duty of every
successive captain is to preserve the ship until it reaches its
destination, and then to colonise the planet we reach. What would we do
otherwise?"

"Then, if I tell you that the planet you currently appear to target,
which may have been superficially suitable when viewed by Earth
telescopes, is not, it fact, a viable colonisation planet, what will you
do?"

"If we so determine, we have a list of alternate destinations. We simply
collect what water and minerals we require from the asteroids
and moons of the star system we have reached and redirect to another
destination, however long it takes. The ship and its mission are
essentially immortal, even if we individuals are not."

"Wait a minute," said Rydell, "With your technology, we could reach our
destination much more quickly!"

"You anticipate our offer. In principle, we could load the Mustang Sally
aboard the
Banks, and convey it to a suitable deserted planet within a few months."

Raymond exploded. "Under no circumstances! That is not what we are here
for!"

"Oh, it's a great offer, Captain," said Rydell. "Think. You could be the
man who starts the colony. Something you never even hoped for."

"Neither hoped for nor wished!"

Lem said quietly: "This is what we feared. It was clear that most of the
crew of the Blue Suede Shoes found the change to their expected
existence and lifespan too much to comprehend. The result was chaos,
aggravated by the fact that discipline on board was much inferior to
your own."

"Please," said Raymond, "Leave us alone to continue our mission. It was
generous of you to offer assistance, but we do not need it."

"As you wish, Captain, but may I offer the following compromise? We
could convey the Mustang Sally to within, say, 30 years travel at your
current capability, from a suitable planet. Further, we would offer to
accommodate on Iain M Banks a number of your crew to supervise the early
terraforming of the colony, and convey them there to anticipate your
arrival. This would save many generations of your people the drudgery
and continued risk of your slow approach to the new colony, while
averting the psychological upheaval that would be occasioned by doing
the journey all at once."

Raymond was silent.


<p class=drop>Fleet Auxiliary Doctor E E Smith, on indefinite loan from
HTW Iain M Banks, orbited the green and blue sphere that was to become a
new home for mankind. Lieutenant Kay-Zee Jones, chief police officer on
the	Smith, was still having trouble with Tazio, who, armed with
wonderful devices beyond even his fantastic dreams, managed to irritate
the serious-minded terraforming crew. His latest prank had been to
release a swarm of tiny flying eyes which penetrated every corner of the
ship and relayed live video to his handheld. E E, the AI that was the
guiding
personality of the E E Smith quickly disposed of them with a spray of
tiny laser cannons. Kay-Zee was irritated that E E had clearly been
amused by Tazio's game, and was further inhibited from serious action by
the fact that his father, Captain Rydell, was the senior human officer
aboard.

Having taken this momentous step, to break away from the Mustang Sally
with a crew of forward-looking personnel, she reflected that life was
not going to be all that different after all.

[*ITEM] Must Be in the Fifties

[*AUTHOR] Andrew&nbsp;Leon Hudson

[*BLURB] This story must be in the fifties... on the cheekiness scale.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><i>“Ooo-wee</i>, what a beaut!”

“Thanks, Tom.”

Tom leaned on the fence and gave his head a half-shake of admiration.
His neighbour's new model had been parked out in front of the house all
day. He had been unable to stop directing an envious eye across their
property line, but this was the first time he'd seen Bill outside, first
chance to strike up a conversation and pull a few
details.

“Fresh off the lot, right?”

“The factory floor.” Bill tilted back his tan leadora to let a little
sun onto his forehead while protecting the hair from a breezy ruffling.
There was a smile of real satisfaction on his face: happy, relaxed, true
satisfaction.

Tom wasn't wearing a hat and was glad of the wind. He only had the one,
so he felt he had to save it for the working week. Got to make sure he
looked in keeping with the boss's expectations regarding sound
employees. But ever since that ozone layer went up with Bikini atoll,
the summers had been getting hotter. He rubbed a gritty palm over his
shiny dome and thought about slapping on a bit more cream up there. Lot
of rads coming down today, the count must be in the fifties.

“Top of the range, or am I wrong?” he said.

“I guess you know your way around them, Tom.” 

That was nice of Bill to say. Tom was touched. Always playing it cool,
that was Bill, never one to brag. Tom knew if it had been him, he'd have
been cruising around town showing off to everyone in sight, whether he
knew them or not. Or maybe not. Hell, you'd have been hard pressed to
get him out of her for a minute all weekend.

Bill had been edging his lawn with a top of the range Whirly-Weeder and,
suddenly self-conscious, Tom dropped his manual shears blade-down into
the flowerbed so they stood out of sight behind a small shaped privet.
Then he felt kind of stupid, and a little ashamed, because Bill knew he
didn't make so much cash at the plant, and he knew Bill didn't care.

“Must have set you back some,” he said, in spite of himself.

“Well, Tom, I don't want to go into the pennies of it, you know.” 

“But she's worth every one, I'll bet!” 

Bill shared a twinkly smile and Tom had to grin back. Bill was a good
neighbour. Always happy to lend a guy the use of his ride mower for an
afternoon. Always quick to share a beer over the fence when he came home
in the evening with a six-pack. An all-round decent guy to have in the
house next door. The way Tom figured it, Bill deserved every bit of good
fortune that came his way.

“Got to say, I’m tempted myself. It’s been a while for ol’ Brenda and,
well, you know.”

“Sure, Tom, sure.” 

<div class=pullquote>“Why don’t you join me in a cocktail?”</div>Bill
didn’t, but Tom couldn’t help but glance ol’ Brenda’s way. He’d
never be one of those guys chasing a new ride every year, but there
comes a time when you just can’t help but notice the flaws creeping in.
Just last weekend he’d been under the hood for hours only to get home
Monday evening to find she was leaking again.
	
“What’s the interior like?”

“Calf leather.” Bill looked very pleased. “Smooth as skin, because it
is, like the man said.”

“Real smooth. Give her a name?”

“Just Dee, I think.” 

Dee. All gleaming sheen and glorious curves. Not like his clunky old
bucket. “She’s a doll, no question.”

“Yep.”

“I’d love to take her for a spin!” he enthused. 

Bill raised his eyebrows. “Well... lawn won’t do itself, Tom,” he said.
He flipped on the Whirly-Weeder again and strolled away along the flower
bed.

<i>Oh no</i>, Tom thought, <i>me and my big mouth</i>. He followed on
his side of the white picket. “Hey, ah, Bill,” he said, raising his
voice over the whine of the motor, “sorry about that.”

“Don’t mention it, Tom.”

“Crossed a line, Bill. Didn’t mean anything by it.”

“Really, don’t mention it.”

Tom was sweating now. “You won’t say anything to Mr. Harris, will you?”

Bill stopped, flicked the Whirly-Weeder off again and looked Tom in the
eye. “I’m not going to do anything like that, Tom. You got my word.”

Tom blushed. “I know that, Bill. I’m sorry I even suggested... Aw, hell,
I... I feel like a heel.”

“Forget about it, Tom. I already have.”

Tom plucked at his sticky shirt. “Hey, you want a beer, Bill? I think
I’ve a couple of cool ones on ice.” He had one cool beer, anyway, and if
Bill wanted it—

“Thanks Tom, but why don’t you join me in a cocktail?” Bill fished in
his back pocket and came out with something like one of those old
two-ways Tom’s lieutenant used to be so proud of during the war. Only
bigger. Bill held down the button and said, “Dee. Make. Two. Mai. Tai.”

They both watched as Dee got up out of the sun lounger and wiggled
towards the wet bar in the dining room. Tom could hardly believe her
breasts. Double-D’s and unreal. Must be in the fifties.

“She’s quite a mover. And voice activated.”

“Wireless was an option, but worth the extra.”

“They do a payment plan, you think?”

“Maybe. Ask.”

“Yeah, yeah, I will.”

Dee returned with their drinks. She took a while to cross the lawn, but
Tom had no problem waiting.

“Thanks. Honey. Why. Don’t. You. Do. Your. Front. For. A. While. Hmm?”

“SURE THING BABY.”

Tom raised his glass. “Here’s to you, eh Bill?” 

“Thanks, Tom. And really, don’t worry about before. Neighbours have to
look out for each other, you hear? We’re all in it together, pal.”

Tom sipped his Mai Tai. Perfect. <i>Still</i>, he thought, <i>kinda
weird, that neighbours comment. More than a shade of pinko, really. What
was that firebrand senator, that McCarthy guy, what was he always
saying?</i> Tom mused. Maybe he ought to make a phone call.

He tore his gaze away from Dee’s rolling caboose to squint up at the
sun, then blew out a breath. What a summer. Damn hot today.

Must be in the fifties.

[*BLURB] The lengths some people will go to in order to make documentary
tv interesting.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>“We’d like to get some footage inside your
facility,” Daphne said, leaning low in case a swollen wedge of cleavage
was going to make the difference. “I believe it’s named after your
grandfather?”

“Joseph Henderson, The First. Sure, we can arrange that. We’re so proud
of all that Adalet is. In fact, our planet’s name says it all: Justice.
That’s what my grandfather and all the other pilgrims dreamed of. And
that’s what we’ve achieved.”

“Then that would be wonderful.” Daphne leaned back so her blouse closed
again, disconcerted that Henderson had ignored it. Men you couldn’t read
or manipulate were trouble, and she needed to do both right now. “Shall
we say tomorrow, then?”

“Tomorrow it is. When do you hope to broadcast, by the way? We get some
of your Earth stations on Adalet. Several of your soap operas are very
popular.”

“Not until next year.
This is a documentary we’re making, so it won’t be on any of the
entertainment channels.” Her smile was tight.

“Never mind. I’m sure you’ll do a wonderful job.” He patted her knee
without any sexual overtones--which just made it patronising. “Until
tomorrow.”

<p class=drop>“You do know there are over two hundred and twenty
colonies in the Raghavan System?” her producer, Macie, felt it necessary
to remind her. “Adalet just happens to be one of the few interesting
ones. Just be thankful it’s not the only one, is what I’m saying.”

“It’s unique because of its justice system, nothing else. Doesn’t
exactly make for sexy TV.”

“Why are you so tetchy about this? Religious groups, ecological
self-sufficiency, new forms of government and economy, you know the
score. It’s what brought pilgrims out here and what we’re here to cover.
If you don’t like it, I don’t know why you volunteered for this series.”

“You know exactly why, Macie: because this was all there was. Presenting
jobs aren’t exactly falling from the trees.” She turned away and dug her
nails into her palms to stop herself saying more. <i>Revealing</i> more.
Two hundred and twenty inhabited planets--there had to be one worth
calling home.

“Yes, well, presenters are. So unless you want Alan to fire your arse
and replace it with some shareholder’s niece, play nicely and do what
the channel tells you.”

“You’re all heart, Macie.”

“I am what I am, Daphne. You should try facing the same reality. ”

<p class=drop>“No, we don’t need any of the history - they’ll run a
short montage explaining how the founders came here, their concept of a
new justice system and their early days in setting it up. What we’re
here to capture is how all that theory is now operating in practice.”

“Oh, it was <i>always</i> more than just theory,” Joseph Henderson told
her. “My grandfather conducted studies, even had some limited success
back on Earth. Back there, they wouldn’t let him go the whole way with
his vision though, which is why he needed a place like Adalet.”

“Yes.” Daphne’s smile had now wound so tight it puckered the corners of
her lips and had pinged out a nerve under each eye. “So, if you could
give us some examples of how you deal with different crimes, then our
audience will get something of what makes Adalet so unique.”

<div class=lpullquote>“They have something similar on Earth for
relaxation therapy.”</div>“Several of our neighbouring planets have
introduced our methods or even
asked us to come and operate their criminal justice systems. We’ve
turned from pioneers to exporters. Just last month, we got a communiqué
from Earth… though I’m not at liberty to mention the country nor persons
concerned.”

“Mister Henderson?”

“Oh. Quite. Sorry. I can’t help but get carried away when I’m talking
about our successes. So, are we rolling? Is that still the right word?
Great. Shall I just explain a few of our procedures? Okay, okay. Well,
I’m not sure where to start…”

“Tell us what happens if someone is convicted of stealing,” Daphne said.

“They’re forced to watch their belongings being given or taken away, one
at a time, over the course of a week. The recipients are anyone who
turns up at their house. Often, we set out trestle tables on the front
lawn and passers-by can just help themselves. Once word gets out, more
turn up, of course.”

“And if the crime involves violence?”

“We use a variant of the stocks. Those wooden contraptions they put
people in in Medieval times? Well, it’s the psychological effect really.
It’s not the pain a victim remembers from an assault, but the emotional
after-tremors. The aggressor is locked into our stocks so they’re
standing upright, dressed in facility-issue shorts, with their head
fixed in a brace so they can’t look up, down, to the sides. Anyone who
wants to can approach and… well, it’s pinches and slaps mostly because
anything greater and they’d be committing an offence themselves. The
aggressor can’t see it coming--but they feel it. And, more importantly,
they fear it.”

Daphne forced out the next line from the board Macie was holding up and
jabbing with her finger. “And… murder?”

“Total sensory deprivation. The chambers are designed so they lie there
as good as dead. Like a conscious coma.” The way Henderson said it, the
smile that accompanied it - all syrup and shine— added to its horror.
Poe would have approved.

“They have something similar on Earth for relaxation therapy,” Daphne
said, as an attempt to soften the image.

“Not like this. The nearest to this would be to be cut adrift in deep space.”

Daphne swallowed what felt like a dry teabag. “I think that’s enough for
the moment.” She could feel her features sag as the blood drained from
her cheeks. “Are we okay, Macie?”

“Fine. We’ll get some more shots around the facilities.”

“Sure.”

<p class=drop>Daphne didn’t have to feign the dizzy
spell. As she flipped through her news dispatcher, she saw Alan's body
had been discovered and time of death put at the day before their
departure for Adalet, scuppering any last chance of an easy alibi and a
return to Earth. When they went through the list of visitors their boss
had received that day--which of course they would - then...

“Madam?” 

Daphne gasped. 

“I’m sorry, but your producer sent me to fetch you. She’s waiting for
you at the Deprivation Chamber.”

“I’m really not feeling too well…” 

Joseph Henderson’s assistant opened his hands helplessly, shrugged, but
made no move to leave. Daphne sighed. “Okay. Tell Macie I’m coming.”

“I’d better escort you, madam. It’s quite a maze.”

Daphne followed the assistant along a white-tiled corridor that should
have led to a basement morgue. Perfect. She attempted to take her mind
off that line of thought. “Has it really been such a success - all of
this?”

“Adalet? Absolutely. We never have repeat offenders. Mind you, neither
did The Inquisition - but for other reasons.” He drew a finger across
his throat and made the sound her cat used to make when it was angry.
Another wave of nausea crashed against the wall of her stomach and she
put out a hand to steady herself.

She tried again with the distraction technique. “Do you know of anyone,
personally, who’s had cause to experience a punishment?”

“Of course. All of us. Well, we have to.”

“You… what?”

“To know what it’s like. Didn’t you know? It’s not enough that the
sentence merely fits the crime. This isn’t a punishment facility - it
exists as a means to remind a perpetrator of the consequences of doing
wrong. Prevention is better than punishment, and for that an
individual’s got to fully appreciate what those consequences are from
the outset. Adalet believes in the practical. If you don’t know what’s
waiting for you, why are you ever going to avoid it?”

She thought of Alan, his empty promises, the jobs he’d passed onto his
latest squeeze that should have been hers. Had he known what was waiting
for him?

By the time they reached the room which housed the deprivation tanks,
her mind was made up. Macie felt obliged to sound dubious but Daphne
knew she loved it: the producer’s eyes brightening even after the shock
of Alan’s death.

“Well, hey. If you’re sure you want to do it, Daphne?”

“Sure I’m sure.” She climbed into the tank before the second thoughts
became third. It couldn’t be that bad. Not when there was no pain and
just brief, dark oblivion. Sure. Just like those relaxation tanks.	Only
more so.

It couldn’t be that bad.

<p class=drop>It was worse.

It was like an intense version of those anxiety nightmares you had when
you realised you were sleeping and wanted to wake up but were paralysed
and could only wait until the terror deigned to ease its grip.

“…just you and your conscience, alone in the dark,” Henderson was saying
to camera when they opened the tank up fifteen minutes later. Her face
was streaked with tears, her hair frizzed and tangled, her fingers
twisted to claws, and her body couldn’t stop shivering.

“Daphne? Are you okay?” But even in her current state, Daphne could
still tell Macie was thrilled at how this would look on film.

“It was me,” she told him, the camera. “I killed Alan.”

Joseph Henderson’s look was of disappointment, but not shock. Macie’s
was pure confusion.

“Ahh. That is its other effect,” Henderson said with a sigh. “Sometimes,
I rather think we should rename it ‘The Confessional’. Everyone who’s
ever lain in there finds their conscience pricked into admitting their
crimes. Some from years back - things they’ve had weighing on them all
this time.”

Daphne saw Macie edge away from her and the tank. Probably wondering
which she should fear most. Daphne didn’t care. Everyone carried baggage
off Earth.

[*BLURB] How to deal with a helicopter crash - backwoods style.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Deputy Harris scratched the back of his
neck. “Well, that’s pretty damn weird. Huh, Sheriff?”

I removed my hat and ran fingers through my hair. “You got this singular
talent for saying what everyone else is thinking, Tom. Don’t let anyone
ever tell you different.” We were standing on the lip of a natural
depression, up on Dead Pine Ridge. We had an impact crater, we had blast
damage to the surrounding trees, we had the local fire department
dampening down the smouldering undergrowth around the perimeter.

What we <i>didn’t</i> have was a downed aircraft.

Old Man Haskins had called it in; a helicopter flying low over his farm
and then an explosion further up the valley. Hell, you could see the
column of smoke from outside my office back in Henderson. As the nearest
ambulance was twenty minutes further away in Porterfield, me and Tom had
rounded up Doc Fraser and headed out – followed by the town fire truck
once enough volunteers had reported in.

And we’d found this; your typical crash site, just lacking any shred of
wreckage. It was, as Tom put it, ‘pretty damn weird’ – and I don’t like
weird. I’d lived in Henderson for almost thirty years and been Sheriff
for the last fifteen. Not so much a testament to my re-election skills,
more like nobody else wanted the job. Henderson was a small town with a
small town mentality and a small town crime rate; drunk and disorderly,
the odd domestic dispute, petty theft – nothing to write home about. Now
I was facing a situation that made my head hurt.

Tom lowered his voice. “Say, what if this is all just a distraction?
You, me, the volunteers, all stuck out here with nobody back home
minding the store.”

I frowned. “You mean everyone likely to cause a ruckus? Well, I hear
what you say, Tom, but it’s not like Henderson is an obvious target for
armed robbery. Even if you cleaned out every business on Main Street I
doubt you’d get more than a thousand dollars. That’s pretty small change
given the time and effort required to fly up here and drop a bomb.”

He scratched the back of his neck again. “Well, then maybe it’s an
assassination. Maybe someone we don’t know about is going to pass
through town and this is to get us out of the way.”

“Uh-huh, passing through town, heading <i>where</i>, exactly? The
blacktop goes as far as Gaines Mill and after that it’s dirt roads over
the ridge until you pick up the interstate around Blackwing. Nope,
whatever this is, it ain’t criminal.”

We both turned towards the sound of a pickup bouncing up the fire trail
at the foot of the slope. It was Jeff Younger, one of the volunteer
firemen. Younger was a veteran; two tours in Iraq without a scratch and
then hit by friendly fire forty-five minutes after landing in
Afghanistan, which had to be some kind of record. He’d come home minus
an eye but with some Afghan Army shrapnel embedded in his skull by way
of compensation.

Jeff got out and walked up to us, carrying his helmet. “Sheriff. Tom. I
was working the south forty when the siren went off and I guess the guys
felt they couldn’t wait any longer. Just what kind of-” He broke off
abruptly on reaching us, staring down at the crash site. “What the fuck
is that?”

Tom and I looked at each other, then at Jeff. He was a pretty solid guy
but sometimes he saw things that weren’t there – I figured his
hallucinations were brought on by all that metal in his head. However,
as things stood, I wasn’t going to discount anything which might shed
some light on what we were dealing with. I tried to sound curious rather
than wary. “OK, Jeff, you got the bead on this one. What’s the story?”

He pointed. “Seriously, you can’t see that? It’s like a big ball of blue
gas, real sparkly, floating just above the ground, down in the middle of
the crater.”

Tom and I looked, we looked real hard. My deputy shrugged. “Nope, I got
nothing.”

Doc Fraser had been sitting on a fallen log, smoking, his talents
unneeded. Now he stood up and walked over. “Is it just the gas you can
see, Jeff? Nothing else, no prominent smell, no background sound you
can’t account for?”

Jeff glared at us. “I ain’t crazy, dammit! It’s a ball of swirling gas,
but a perfect sphere, like it’s behind glass. There are sparks in it,
like fireflies.”

I tried not to show any emotion. “Sounds real pretty. Maybe it’s some
kind of thermal after-image, from the explosion? Some people can see
residual heat better than others.”

Tom nodded. “That’s a fact. Could be real useful in your line of work,
Jeff.”

Younger sounded uncertain. “Yeah, well, could be that, I suppose.
Anyhow, I best go help the guys finish up… Hey, where’s all the goddam
wreckage?”

I set my hat in place and smoothed down the brim. “Yeah, we noticed that
as well. The department is looking into it, Jeff, don’t you worry.”

He looked unconvinced but went on his way. Tom frowned. “Looking into
it? We’re looking into a big, empty, hole, that’s what we’re looking
into. Great story this is gonna’ make, over a few beers at Macintyre’s.
‘Local police find nothing, film at eleven.’ At least the fire
department got to douse some bushes.”

<div class=pullquote>I checked the Winchester 30-30 was loaded and put a
handful of shells in the pocket of my windbreaker for easy
access.</div>I half laughed. “Easy there, tiger. If anyone asks, this is
an on-going
investigation, and you can’t comment further, right? Anyway, the fire
crew are packing up, so let’s get everyone back to town before it's
overrun by gun-toting marauders.”

“You taking the rise out of me, Sheriff?”

“Wouldn’t dream of it, Tom.” The three of us walked down to the 4-by-4
and I lifted the radio handset out through the open window. “Sally, this
is John. Come back.”

Our office receptionist sounded nervous. <i>“I’m here, Sheriff. Is it
real bad out there? The ambulance from Portersville is on its way, but
it'll take another half hour at least.”</i>

“Well, tell them to stand down, but with our thanks. Whatever happened
up here it wasn’t a crash, so we’re heading back. Say, is Quinn about?
It’s Tuesday, and he normally visits the store on a Tuesday.”

Jonas Quinn was our resident weirdo, a loner who rarely ventured into
town. Rumour was he’d been some kind of surveillance expert back east,
maybe even a spook, before suffering a mental breakdown. Certainly his
semi-derelict Airstream was festooned with more satellite dishes and
antennae than a major radio station.

<i>“Ah, yeah, I believe he was about earlier.”</i>

“Right, well, go ask him to come out here with his radiation meter,
metal detector and anything else he might have that can find what we
can’t see. If he’s amenable, that is.”

Sally sounded dubious. <i>“Well, I’ll try. What should I say is going
on?”</i>

I laughed. “Like I should know? Just tell him we have some unexplained
phenomena. The guy is a UFO nut, I’m sure he’ll jump at the chance to
poke around out here.”

<i>“I’ll get right on it, Sheriff. Sally out.”</i>

I tossed the handset onto the seat. “Tom, take the Doc back into town.
I’ll wait for Quinn and catch a ride with him once we’re done. Assuming
he bites, that is. If not, you’ll have to come pick me up, preferably
this side of winter.”

Tom opened his mouth but the Doc spoke first. “Fine by me – and don’t
even think about volunteering to stay out here with your beloved leader,
Tom Harris. I’m way too old to have my bones shook from their sockets
riding the fire truck.”

My deputy frowned. “Well, OK, but if I don’t pass Quinn I’ll be right
back.”

“Wouldn’t expect anything less from you, Tom.“ I scratched my chin. “The
only outfit around these parts likely to have a helicopter is Black Bear
Mining. When you get back to the office check to see if they’re missing
a bird.” He nodded. I tried to sound casual. “Best leave me the
flashlight and the rifle, and that box of shells. I might do some
hunting while I wait, so the day ain’t a complete bust.”

I had a reputation as a backwoodsman, having scoured the surrounding
hills for years in search of game. Even so, I could tell that Tom wasn’t
happy about how things were playing out. Even Doc Fraser raised his
eyebrows, but I just smiled. “You still here, Tom? That wife of yours
will think we’re sitting around the camp fire, swigging moonshine. Now,
git.”

I stood back while everyone else left, deflecting any attempts at
conversation. I stood until the fire truck and 4-by-4 were just dust
trails, way down the hillside, then turned and walked back up to the
crash site. I sat on the same log as Doc Fraser and waited.

There was no wind to stir the leaves, no sound at all – not even
birdsong. I checked the Winchester 30-30 was loaded and put a handful of
shells in the pocket of my windbreaker for easy access. Time passed. The
shadows lengthened.

My walkie-talkie crackled. <i>“Sheriff, this is Tom.”</i> His voice was
faint, riding a wave of static.

“Reading you, Tom, if barely. What’s the story?”

<i>“Just got a message from Sally, well, two, actually. She found Quinn
and apparently he’s on his way to you along with a whole bunch of weird
equipment.”</i>

“Sounds good. At least I won’t be walking home.”

<i>“Yeah, well, it looks like you’re gonna’ have some other company as
well.”</i>

Even distorted, his tone of voice made me uneasy. “Uh-huh. Care to
expand on that?”

<i>“Four guys showed up at the office in a black SUV. Suits, short hair,
sunglasses. Said they were from Black Bear and had we found their
missing helo? Of course Sally didn’t know any better so she sent them on
up to you. They ain’t passed me yet so you want I should pull them
over?”</i>

I couldn’t fault his enthusiasm but there was a heavy-handed feel to
this I didn’t like and nothing to be gained by putting him in
harm’s way. “No, let them be. But if me and Quinn aren’t back in, say,
two hours, maybe you and some of the guys might like to come join me for
some evening target practice?”

<i>“You got it, Sheriff. Tom out.”</i>

Black Bear had a prospecting operation at the base of Pharaoh’s Peak –
it kind of looked like a pyramid – two valleys over. The flight path
between there and the landing strip at Blackwing would have taken them
in this direction, but there was nothing to explain what had become of
their aircraft.

No conventional explanation, at any rate.

Sometimes you have to go on gut instinct and hope it’s based on
subconscious analysis and not just wishful thinking.

Sometimes you just get lucky. 

I stood up and undressed, laying my clothes out neatly on the log. 

It was almost dusk but the air still felt warm against my skin. I took a
deep breath, exhaled, and relaxed – letting my body shrink back into its
original size and shape. The sense of relief was palpable; maintaining a
human form was the equivalent of keeping your cheeks puffed out, only
for days at a time. I couldn’t risk dropping my disguise in town, even
in the relative privacy of my own home. It was only out here, in the
guise of one of my frequent hunting trips, that I was able to be myself.
Even with my own eyes there was no sign of the phenomena reported by
Jeff Younger. I sat down to wait for Quinn’s arrival, enjoying the world
through unadulterated senses.

Eventually I heard the sound of an approaching vehicle and slid into the
bushes, in case the Black Bear team had passed Quinn’s decrepit station
wagon and reached me first. However, the dust settled to reveal his
rust-coloured (and covered) Buick. He was alone. Quinn struggled up the
slope, arms filled with esoteric electronic equipment, and stopped on
the lip of the depression.

I stepped out into view.

He grunted and set down his burden. “You’re taking a bit of a risk,
aren’t you? The NSA could have this whole area under satellite
surveillance. The last thing we need is you getting hauled off to Area
Fifty-One. If you’re feeling suicidal at least let me make some money
out of a pay-per-view alien autopsy.”

I smiled at his ingrained paranoia, finding it hard to set aside human
reactions after all this time. We’d been marooned on Earth for decades,
unable to locate the transfer pod containing the wormhole initiator.
Eventually I figured out it had probably been the ‘comet’ of 1892, as
recorded in the archives of the <i>Porterfield Examiner</i>. That’s the
problem with side-stepping relativity, pinning down the ‘when’ of a
temporal insertion can be problematic. I’d reasoned that, as Sheriff, if
any of the locals <i>did</i> discover the pod, I’d be the first person
they’d contact. As for ‘Quinn’, since arriving in town he’d been
monitoring the area for anomalous energy emissions - all to no avail.

But now I believed we had our way home. “Relax, the only thing we have
to worry about are some corporate security goons chasing a missing
helicopter.” I took in the crash site with a sweep of my arm. “I think
Black Bear Mining discovered the initiator and triggered the activation
sequence while trying to fly it out. It looks like the wormhole formed
just before impact.”

He stroked his chin. “That’s one hell of a stretch. Even if you’re right
that leaves us worse off than before. I don’t see the Bureau mounting a
second attempt to pull us out, especially if an alien flying machine
just crash-landed in the retrieval centre.”

“Ah, but Jeff Younger says he can see a big, sparkling ball of blue gas,
down there. A perfect sphere.”

The Quinn-shape snorted. “A residual event horizon? Do you have any idea
how rare that is?”

“I believe the term ‘gift horse’ is appropriate, given the
circumstances. Look, can you make it visible?”

He turned to his heap of miscellaneous equipment. “Yeah, yeah, all it
takes is a modified Xeon projector. I’ll need a few minutes.”

I looked back down the valley. “A few minutes is perhaps all the time we
have, so work quickly.” Changing back into human form might have been
the smart move right then, but you have to understand the relief I felt
at escaping from ‘John Bane’.

Eventually my fellow infiltrator stood back from the apparatus he’d
assembled. “OK, it’s warming up. We should be able to see what there is
to see anytime… now.” The wormhole aperture flickered into view,
transformed into a perfect silver sphere that reflected its
surroundings. He sounded worried. “Integrity is way down, way below the
safe operating level for a group transfer.”

“Are you saying it’s useless?”

“No, not quite… but it’s like a soap bubble. The first person to cross
the threshold will trigger an immediate collapse. They’ll
<i>probably</i> stay ahead of the compression surge all the way through,
but I can’t guarantee the egress point will be as expected. Either way
this is a high-risk deal, and only for one of us.” He sounded
tense, a hand resting on the gun-butt protruding from his jacket pocket.

“I was in charge, the senior agent. The success or failure of this
mission is my responsibility.” I returned to my pile of belongings. “You
should be the one to go.”

My colleague sounded pathetically grateful. “Of course I’ll inform our
superiors of your sacrifice. Perhaps the gesture will spur them into
sending a second pod, or even a ship?” I said nothing. We both knew that
retrieving information on a backwater world such as Earth wouldn’t
justify such expense. He cleared his throat. “Very well, when
deactivating the projector there is no ‘on-off’ switch, you simply have
to-”

A snatch of poetry came to mind, to serve as eulogy for my fallen
comrade. “A day like any other, a night like none has gone before. The
future glitters on far horizon, the past, a distant shore.”

I took one long, last, look around, and kissed the Earth ‘goodbye’.
