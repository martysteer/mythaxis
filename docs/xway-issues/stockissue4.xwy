[*BLURB] Business Ethics - Oriental style

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Selkirk thought he knew his way around Hong
Kong because it was just ten years since he'd been there, in 2020. He
was wrong. Being able to read a few thousand chinese characters gave him
little advantage, because western script, specifically English, was
everywhere. Most of Central district had been cocooned in a two-level
air-conditioned mall in which those buildings which had been preserved
from before mallization were unrecognisable at street level, while their
upper floors were hidden from view above the mall roof. Like many new
developments, the complex was double-insulated and clad in photo-voltaic
cells, which together rendered the cost of air-conditioning the mall to
a fragment of the energy expenditure that would have been used in the
"old" days prior to 2025. In daylight hours, most of the illumination was
provided by light pipes that sucked light from the surface to deliver it
where required, supplemented by low power LEDs. After a slow start,
China had proved itself ingeniously responsive to energy constraints.
Selkirk spent half an hour trying to get his bearings among the
international design boutiques, the exquisitely tempting consumer
electronics outlets and the many mysterious polished establishments
which did not advertise their trade. He gave up when he realised that
even those streets which survived under the canopy had had their names
changed. Feeling chilled in his light shirt and trousers, because of the
mall's efficient, even over-enthusiastic, climate control, and
despairing of finding his way back to the hotel easily, he hailed a
trishaw and had himself conveyed there.

<p class=drop>Balwant Singh sat in the armchair in Selkirk's hotel room
and laughed loudly through his beard when he heard. "You should have
called me in the first place, old boy," he chuckled, "Didn't I used to
be your Hong Kong wallah?" He was a tall, broad-shouldered man who used
his booming voice, his British Indian lingo, his turban and his whiskers
to enhance his presence, which was already considerable. "You won't get
to see David Lee without my invaluable assistance." 

"Yeah, yeah. I didn't know how fat you'd become, though. Whisky?"
Selkirk already had an appointment with Lee, but Balwant Singh might
make things easier. 

"Whisky? Thanks, I don't mind if I do. I may have put on a few pounds,
but I can still look after myself... and after you, white man. Anyhow,
you're looking a bit grey on top, aren't you, eh?" Selkirk was
increasingly aware of not only greyness, but baldness, though he
retained his youthful wiry frame at forty-five. 

<p class=drop>Balwant Singh knew the way out of the mall all right. His
height and his white turban meant Selkirk could stay quite a long way
back and still follow, although thousands of other people were between
and around them. Selkirk was supposed to be attending the meeting alone.
Balwant had agreed, for a fee, to be guide and bodyguard, but to keep
his distance. The tall Sikh was a familiar figure in Hong Kong. No-one
would be surprised to see him. 

When they emerged into the open air from the chemically-scented cool of
the mall, the clammy heat engulfed Selkirk and moisture condensed in
beads on his super-cooled person. He looked up. The slot of sky visible
between high towers was an unhealthy, bruised colour. He was perspiring
a rivulet down his back by the time Balwant started to climb the steep
streets up the hill. Selkirk was sure it was Ice House Street, but it
had been so rebuilt that he did not recognise it. He closed in on
Balwant. The narrow streets and inter-building walkways offered more
restricted sight lines. In places like this, it is important how a
person walks, because if you show indecision or unfamiliarity with the
environment, you're dead meat commercially.

They were now passing through an area that was almost entirely offices
and up-market apartment blocks. This was where a lot of the old
workshops and sweat shops and marginal enterprises had previously clung
to the steep northern slopes of the island. Odd corners of ancient
masonry, pavements and kerbs occasionally broke through the polished
surfaces of new development. Balwant and Selkirk were heading for the
labyrinth into which these freelance traders had been displaced. No-one
knew how many kilometers of passageways had been hacked out of the very
fabric of Hong Kong island. Rock from the constant tunnelling was
secretly sold to firms who were reclaiming land from the shore. These
construction firms had been accustomed to importing rock by sea. Now it
was a domestic product. Occasional fatal tunnel collapses went
unremarked.

From time to time, they passed incongruous, foul-smelling handcarts
being guided down the perfectly formed walkways of the hill, usually in
the charge of some wizened oldster.

A crack of thunder was followed a few seconds later by a deluge that was
pretty welcome to Selkirk, cool rain replacing sticky sweat in his
shirt. Shortly thereafter, a torrent of dirty water cascaded down the
hill towards them, carrying all sorts of floatable garbage. It was as
though everyone above here had seized the opportunity to ditch that
wooden crate, that wastepaper bucket, those plastic dolls' heads. It
didn't smell too good, either. Selkirk's shoes, socks and trouser cuffs
were saturated before he could take evasive action.  He saw one of the
handcarts deliberately up-ended into the torrent by its owner. The
contents appeared to be sewage. Balwant leapt for a low decorative
sculpture in concrete that adorned the solar panel-clad façade of a bank
building and Selkirk sprinted to join him.

"Is this sewage from the tunnels?" Selkirk asked.

"Probably. Some of the sewage and other waste is fermented to industrial
gas inside. The rest is transported out of the tunnels in hand carts,
and disposed of in a thousand incidents like this one. A little pungent
for the Sahib's delicate nostrils, is it? You should try Delhi, man!"

The shower and subsequent rush of water and debris soon passed, and they
continued up the hill together. Somehow, Selkirk had expected the tunnel
entrances to be secret, clandestine as they certainly were. But a large
gateway, decorated in the traditional fashion of Chinatown gateways the
world over, bordered the uneven cave opening in the cliff face. Dirty
water trickled out at one side. Loops and festoons of black cable and
blue translucent plastic piping were roughly suspended along the rock,
disappearing inside the cavern. 

"The public part of the cave," said Balwant, interpreting Selkirk's
surprise, "Is completely above board. But it is only one chamber."

The narrow crack whistled with a warm draught, almost a gale, filled
with the smells of humanity, vegetable-based hard plastics and Chinese
spices and remedies. The aperture widened almost immediately into a
well-lit, high cavern of white rock, possibly a natural phenomenon.
Numerous market stalls were ranged in rows and levels, starting with
those against the rear wall, up to the nearest rank almost blocking
entry to the cave. Most of the stalls offered food and drink, but there
were also multiple competing music stalls demonstrating their ripped
wares; a medical shop with attached acupuncture, selling the body parts
of extinct and endangered animals - "Guaranteed Genuine" but more likely
grown in tissue cultures from cloned stem cells; a booth set up as a
stage in which the traditional story of "Journey to the West" was being
performed by the most ingeniously designed puppets dressed in rich,
stylised costumes - not conventional marionettes or hand puppets, but
apparently controlled by radio from behind the backdrop, a development
of the rather pointless Japanese toy robots so popular in Selkirk's
childhood; a massage parlour in which actual massage was taking place in
full view of the shoppers, administered by hefty, muscular men who would
not have looked out of place in a wrestling ring; another massage
parlour in which the treatment was delivered by robots that looked like
recycled machine tools and assembly turrets. Selkirk was sufficiently
versed in the ways of the Far East not to mistake the stall with live
snakes, dogs, turtles, birds, lizards, exotic fish, insects and monkeys
for a pet shop. These creatures were on sale for human consumption.

"This wind is the ventilation, I take it," asked Selkirk.

"Yes, indeed, I believe so. They talk of a convection system where the
hot air in the upper galleries draws cool air from sea caves and
underground stream beds. But also there are pumps and fans, of course,
driven by stolen electricity. Without these, there would be more of
those distressing incidents in which whole corridors fill with carbon
dioxide and everyone suffocates."

"Very encouraging, Balwant."

"Please do not disturb yourself. David Lee inhabits an area of these
caves favoured by the nabobs and pukka sahibs of the community. Aha!
Here we go, I think."

Balwant led the way into a shop set up on the back wall of the cavern.
Hundreds of electronic gadgets were on offer, most of them duplicates of
well-known brands. Ignoring the merchandise, Balwant entered the office
at the back of the shop, where a cupboard stood open. He entered the
cupboard, and Selkirk, following, saw that they were now in a broad
tunnel. After a few paces, they passed through an open iron door set
across the passageway.

"Is this the secret part?" asked Selkirk.

"One of many." 

"But surely the police have found this entrance by now."

"Absolutely, but there are multiple entrances, and only a few are open
on any day, you see. Also, if a raid begins, signals can be sent ahead
and some doors will be locked ahead of them. It will need to be very
important before the police try to break down these doors. The
industries under the mountain here are useful to the nation, because
many of the products earn foreign exchange by export or are less
expensive replicas of international designer goods for the domestic
market."

Selkirk was temporarily silenced by this comprehensive reply, and
followed Balwant Singh for what seemed like three or four kilometres of
winding, branching, rising passageways. There were people everywhere,
but the  others largely ignored them. Every few yards, the corridor wall
was pierced with an alcove, a side cave, a door, a gate, a shop-front.
One "street" was given over to the manufacture of wheelbarrows from
sheet metal to finished article, another was filled with little
workbenches at which workers, mostly women and children, assembled,
painted and dressed puppets like those Selkirk had seen earlier. Many
businesses appeared to be electronic assembly operations. Primitive food
stalls were inserted wherever there was room to accommodate them.
Handcarts, tiny rickshaws and wheelbarrows were everywhere. There
appeared to be no mechanical transport in the walkways themselves,
though Selkirk caught sight of what appeared to be access points to
freight elevators and rope-propelled railways in the larger caverns. And
there was no apparent shortage of cheap manual labour.

<div class=pullquote>Lee contemplated Selkirk politely, but without apparent enthusiasm.</div>
David Lee's office was a rarity down here - a cave with a gold lettered,
red lacquered, real wood door and toughened glass window letting onto
the corridor, but no apparent commodity on sale. Balwant repaired to a
nearby food stall for a bowl of the spicy soup that he insisted on
calling "mulligatawny". 

Selkirk knocked and entered Lee's office. He was expected. A willowy
secretary, dressed in what appeared to be a brocade evening dress,
welcomed him, ushered him the few steps to Lee's visitor chair, and
disappeared behind a screen. Selkirk was surprised by Lee's relative
youth and his open, friendly face, as they shook hands. A monkey sat on
the desk, examining the framed photograph of a woman and baby with wise
brown eyes, turning it in its little hands. It glanced at Selkirk as he
sat, but never met his gaze. 

<p class=drop>There were similarities between David Lee and Balwant
Singh. Like Balwant, Lee harked back to an age of British rule that
neither he nor his parents could have ever truly known. He affected an
English "Christian" name preceding his Chinese family name. He dressed
in a wool suit, striped cotton shirt and silk tie with what appeared to
be Savile Row labels.

Lee contemplated Selkirk politely, but without apparent enthusiasm.
However, his eyebrows rose very slightly in surprise when Selkirk asked
in Cantonese which Chinese dialect Lee would prefer to speak. Lee
expressed his preference for English, taking an antique Swan fountain
pen from his pocket and making a note on the single sheet of handmade
paper in front of him.

"I understand," said Selkirk, "That you are the man to talk to about
supplies of counterfeit micro components."

"The word 'counterfeit' implies something inferior which masquerades as
the real thing. Any manufacturer with whom I would put you in touch
would prefer the expression 'clone', as his components will be
indistinguishable from the so-called real thing in appearance and
specification, right down to any errors the original manufacturer may
have unintentionally built in to the component. The only difference is
that my suppliers are not licenced to make or to sell these parts and do
not pay a royalty to the patent owner."

"I expected you to be less direct in your description of these goods. Where do you fit in, Mr Lee?"

"A little history. The People's Republic of China took over Hong Kong from the British nearly fifty years ago. At the time, Hong Kong's illicit operations were run by gangs. These gangs were generally, and with varied accuracy, known as Tongs, containing rough fellows with tattoos, who fought each other with meat cleavers, and ran drug operations and prostitution rackets with bloodthirsty efficiency. At the expense of some thousands of casualties on both sides, the People's Army eliminated all the Tongs but one - ours. We behave ourselves and pervade the ruling classes of all China to an extent, and in Hong Kong in particular. You may regard me as the head of the Chamber of Illicit Commerce in Hong Kong. Most of the businesses under the mountain
operate under my protection and you will find no administrative problem that we cannot together solve to our mutual satisfaction."

"I see," said Selkirk. "That seems satisfactory." The monkey abruptly dropped the photograph on the desk and climbed onto Lee's knee. Lee stroked its head.

"However," Lee continued, "I am puzzled. The traditional  sources for such items are Singapore and Taipei. Some are even legitimate, and, therefore, less expensive."

"We are also talking to a Singapore firm," said Selkirk, "Though Singapore is a really dangerous place to break the law. It's the death penalty there for supplying tobacco, and a flogging for smoking in public. God knows what it is for patent infringement." He fished from his pocket a small box. He opened it to reveal a microchip of antique design. "How old do you think this chip is, Mr Lee?" The monkey flinched as Selkirk held the box across the desk.

Lee glanced at the contents. "The fact that it is large enough to be seen with the naked eye indicates to me that it is either immensely complex and quite old, or of medium complexity and extremely old. Judging by the primitive pin configuration, I think it must be the latter."

"Correct. The chip is called E122, and was designed in 2002 or thereabouts. Now, how much do you think it is worth?"

"A few dollars when new, a few cents when in full production or recycled from scrap circuit boards, a few dollars again for its rarity value today if unused."

"Wrong. I would conceal this from you if I could, because it ruins my bargaining position, but you can easily check. On the open market, these chips are changing hands at ninety dollars each or more."

"Incredible. What is so special?"

"The company I represent - I see no reason to hide their identity, because a few enquiries would reveal it to you - is Vertical Dynamics. Vertical designed this chip into the stability module of an early version of their signature product."

"The Manlifter." 

"Yes. The stability module in the Manlifter personal flyer, a bank of electronics and a gyroscope in the platform that together make sure the whole thing doesn't flip over as physics says it ought to, and drive the rider into the ground head first, like a fence post. At the time, and for years afterwards, the E122 chip was in full production and very cheap. More recently, Chiporama has had only this one client for the E122. Vertical Dynamics bought five million a year, one per Manlifter plus spares. Chiporama wanted Vertical to switch to a new chip, but it had never been worth Vertical Dynamics upgrading the module it was used in because it had cost years and casualties to perfect."

"And..."

"And I could waste half an hour explaining what went wrong. In summary, a succession of management errors, mistakes, delays and accidents have resulted in Vertical needing up to two million E122 chips to tide them over and Chiporama being unable to supply them. Vertical need to design, test and get safety approval for a new stabiliser circuit. They attempted to buy as many of the old chips as possible on the open market without creating a scarcity price. They bungled that, too. And then there's Unicorn Lifters."

"Ah. Pepsi to Vertical's Coke."

"Quite so. Unicorn became aware of Vertical's problems.  They mounted an efficient operation to corner the market in new and recycled E122s, and succeeded in buying the patent for the E122 from Chiporama, preventing Vertical from obtaining them legally. So here we are. It's my job to source these chips in such a way that Vertical cannot be proved to have deliberately forged them. By the way, your monkey is about to eat a ninety dollar E122 chip."

Lee held his hand up to the monkey, which dropped the chip in it. Lee returned the chip to its box and snapped it shut. "I can obtain a quotation for you. Do you have the specification for this..."

"E122. Yes, we have." Selkirk handed over a personalised DM wafer.

"You are staying where?"

"The New Mandarin. Name Selkirk." 

"And this is your cellphone number, printed on the DM?"

"It is."

"I shall contact you." Lee stood up, extending his hand, and the monkey jumped back onto the desk. 

Selkirk rose, grasped Lee's hand, and shook. "When?"

"Soon. A day or two. Then we talk about money and samples and a supply route. 

<p class=drop>Betrayal. 

You kind of expect it in the Far East, but David Lee was true to his word, and, three months down the track, a secure supply of E122s was flowing, apparently from a recycling facility in North Cyprus. No-one, not even in Vertical's assembly plant, doubted that they were authentically recycled, as they bore a variety of imprints, slightly bent pins, traces of connector bonding and random scuffing, all carefully applied on the Hong Kong production line, a thoroughly professional job at a good price, thanks to the handsome fee paid to Lee's organisation. 

The weak link, as it turned out, was Balwant Singh. Perhaps someone should have greased his palm more thoroughly, and Selkirk blamed himself for Balwant's clumsy attempt to extort several thousand dollars from Vertical as his price for silence about the illegal supply. Selkirk spoke to him on the telephone, but Balwant sounded tense and resentful, demanding his reward. E-mails went unanswered. He had left his home and was presumably holed up somewhere safe.

When Balwant Singh finally turned up, Selkirk was sent back to Hong Kong. Balwant had been found in a locked hotel room, the only access to which had been the bathroom ventilator. The ventilator grille was lying on the floor of the shower. Detailed police investigation had also revealed a tiny hole in the wall of the room. In theory, someone could have watched Balwant Singh from the next door suite. 

It appeared that Balwant had lost his mind, was blind in one eye and was partially paralysed. Someone had rammed a sharp instrument through his left eye socket into his brain and stirred it around a little. He was raving constantly, and kept yelling "Monkey!" No sharp instrument was present in the hotel room. There was a crazy theory going around that a monkey had been prompted to crawl through the ventilator and attack the victim.

Selkirk paid another visit to David Lee, this time guided by a man sent to his hotel by Lee. Again, he passed the market with its souvenir shops selling framed models of villages carved from cork, water colour paintings on simulated silk, and figurines moulded in ivory-like plastic; the noisy, high stakes mah jonng games; the puppet show; the health stores; the food shops.

Selkirk, led on every previous occasion by Balwant Singh, had visited Lee's office several times since the first occasion, and had taken the trouble to bring a pocketful of peanuts to all subsequent meetings. This time, the monkey, named, as Selkirk now knew,  Salome, took on a sinister significance for Selkirk, in view of the lurid rumours about the manner of the attack on Balwant Singh. The monkey recognised Selkirk as usual and immediately sprang over Lee's desk to explore his pockets.

Selkirk went straight to the issue that was concerning him. "Should I be worried about Salome?"

"In what regard?"

"Balwant Singh's 'accident'."

"You think I might have silenced the Sikh by getting Salome to crawl into his room and poke him it the eye with a stiletto? Absolutely not. She might bite you if you teased her, but she is a gentle creature, as you know. And she could not be trained to do such a thing."

Now he was here, Selkirk had to agree. Salome had retrieved all the nuts and was messily peeling them on Lee's immaculate desk with serious concentration. The theory was, indeed, ridiculous.

"So, what do you think?" asked Selkirk.

"About the Indian? Well, I am not sorry that he has been neutralised, and, I suppose, neither are you. Whoever has done this has earned our gratitude. Do you agree?" Lee scraped together the discarded peanut shells and dropped them in his wastebin, then fastidiously cleaned the desktop with wax polish and a clean duster. Salome sneezed. 

"Yes, I suppose so. I can't help feeling sorry for him, though. He was a good friend and ally at one time."

"Yes, I know. Greed, eh? Cheer up," said Lee. "I have a gift for you." He produced a long box. "It may take you some time to master it. The instructions are in Chinese, but that will not present you with any problem."

Selkirk was surprised. He took the lid off the box to reveal one of the Chinese radio-controlled marionettes he had admired in passing. "It is a fine present. Thank you."

<div class=pullquote><img src="monkey.jpg"></div>"You have mentioned the puppet show more than once. This is a character from the traditional play - Journey to the West. He is called Sun Wukong, but is commonly referred to as The Monkey King."

The marionette certainly had a rather simian face, a prominent tail,
and was dressed in an elaborate costume, covered in symbols and
glittering with gold thread. 

But Selkirk only had eyes for Sun Wukong's long, sharp little spear.

[*ITEM] Central Casting

[*AUTHOR] Chris&nbsp;Penycate

[*BLURB] How real are the characters in this story?

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Yes, I've seen your advertisements in the papers: 
Hero, six foot five, thirty-eight inch chest, must like reptiles;
Princess, beautiful, must be ready to go naked.
And so on.

I don't do it like that; I go round to Central Casting and say "Bert," (the honourable Albert Fotherby-Soams, but don't hold that against him. He dumped the author who wrote him many years ago. And I only go round when he's on duty, because he cares about his characters, and matches them to writers by feel, not computer analysis) "who have you got that really wants to be written?"

His room is lined with loaded bookshelves, and a screen rises from the
table at which he was seated, but he made no move to retrieve
information from either. Another room might have filing cabinets, or
spinning brass gears, or even chained demons, whatever symbol might
appeal to that particular scribe, or researcher. Perhaps the books were
mere props, but the place felt right, and smelled right, for its occupant.
The light couldn't have really been coming through those high-set square
leaded windows, for the room was in no way gloomy, but gave the
impression it was. A comfortable space, dark wood and cloth, none of the
stainless steel and plastic, or magic and weirdness favoured by other
agents.

"I don't know if I've got anyone desperate enough to get mixed up with your crazy plots." He always says that, but he always comes through. "What's the setting this time?"

"Near future, very Big Brother, but supernatural elements."

"So you don't insist on humans? How about a lesbian kung-fu vampire?"

"Sounds promising. What's her name, and is she beautiful?"

He chuckled. "I know better than offer that to you. You wouldn't take a
beautiful one if she stripped down and gave you a blow job at the end of
each chapter."

<div class=lpullquote>Your terror is an educated reaction to the very real dangers</div>"You're right; I don't write stories like that. At least, I haven't up
to now. And remember the last beautiful one you sent me? She spent so
much time with soap and hairbrush we were barely making fifteen miles a
day. If I hadn't dropped her off at that inn in chapter three, and
replaced her with the landlord's dumpy daughter, glaciation would have
set in before we completed the quest. And the new girl could snare, skin
and cook rabbits, and had a wicked sense of humour. When we collected
your protégée in chapter eleven, she was furious at having missed the
action."

"And came back here and joined a barbarian novel, where even charging into battle wearing high-heeled boots, a chain-mail skirt and nipple rings didn't outweigh the advantage that her beauty didn't require maintenance, while you always described the state she actually got into after days of mud, outdoor camping and not wanting to bathe in glacier-fed streams. I seem to recall that the dumpy girl was pregnant when she got back to the inn."

"Was she complaining? She'd been boosted from a non-speaking, practically invisible role to a fully fledged secondary character. Her child starts off with a 'searching for my father' plot, in which she's  bound to have a major part in the first chapters, at least. We each left a unique  symbol, as it wasn't clear which of us... and we left enough money that her father wasn't upset one little bit."

"No matter. The vampire's name is 'Maunissa', but I suspect she'd change if you asked. I think her original author wanted her to be beautiful, but couldn't quite carry off the description; she's got all the right features, but they just add up to 'ordinary'."

"I suppose I'd better meet her, but she sounds pretty promising - well, promising, at least. And you reckon she's OK with technology?"

"Treats it as magic as any mediaeval central European would - but how many modern characters do any different? She's not terrified of it, anyway." He made a couple of gestures over the thick, brassbound book that served him as computer interface or grimoire.

"Unlike me, you mean." 

"Perhaps we could class yours as 'informed caution'. Your terror is an educated reaction to the very real dangers... ah, here we are."

A magical fantasy author would say something about materialisation, an SF one would mention the waft of displaced air, or the hologram-like shimmering. Actually, she was just there, as if she always had been. 

"Maunie, meet Rupert Denver; he's an author."

Her face had indeed missed beauty by all the critical details, but the expression that lit it up almost compensated for them.

"A genuine author? And Bert wouldn't drag me out unless there was a real hope of a job. I could kiss you"

Considering the hardly subtle set of fangs she sported, this was an interesting, if slightly disturbing, prospect.

"Better read some of the stuff he's written first, girl. He's not to
everyone's taste; you'll never be a best seller with him."  

"He could write me stark-naked in an alligator tank in front of a night-club full of drooling voyeurs and it would still be better than this grey non-existence. And he doesn't look like an alligator person."

"I'd have thought," I said, breaking in on their obviously well matured friendship "That, with the number of vampire rip-offs being written now, there'd have been no difficulty finding work."

"In those? I'd spend most of my time flashing these." She gestured to
her breasts, which were 'high, firm and pointed';  they'd have been
enough to get her a film part in reality, but here in fiction they were
just typical. (In CC, find a character who can't get by without a bra,
and firstly, she has to be quite outstanding - only not there - and
secondly, she has to have been written by a woman.) "And I'd have less
personality than a face flannel. Crucifix fodder, and maybe a
paragraph's erotic interest.  Not that I'm averse to erotic interest,
you understand - I was written for it - but there has to be more in
literature than sticking bits of one being into another, be they teeth,
fingers or..."

"I'm sure he's understood, my dear" Bert had been written as Edwardian upper class, and was actually blushing. "Denver doesn't write bodice rippers, or at least he hasn't done so up to now. Sex yes, but copulation off-stage."

"Don't make promises for me, Albert," I interrupted, "I seem to remember that in <i>Last night in La Scala</i> the 'copulation' was actually on stage, even if the audience weren't present." Where Bert had managed to make the word <i>copulation</i> sound natural, from me it was a mockery. 

By now I knew, and Bert knew, and I suspect Maunissa was fairly sure too, that we would be working together, but an interview should be longer than that, or the interviewee doesn't feel taken seriously. "By the way," I asked, "How did he, your author, explain away the kung-fu elements, given your difficulties with running water?" Her features had a trace of Mongol in them; perhaps she'd attained vampirehood only after arriving in Europe.

"Huh. Him? He'd got a family of vampires running a camel caravan along the silk road. The robes protected them from the sun and, since it's desert, obviously no rivers or streams, don't you see? I suppose that, since it's futuristic, my fighting skills are useless. Would you be my leading man, if I were chosen? "

"No, there is a standard leading man in this series. I'm his biographer, sidekick, his Dr, Watson.  And you're on, if you still think you're desperate enough. I'm sure the kung-fu will be useful, once I've worked out how you can travel; nothing is ever wasted, and it'll be great for the film version. Um, film? Moving pictures? You've heard of them?"

She shook her head, flung her arms round me and gave me a kiss (the fangs don't disturb at all) then bounced off to do the same to Bert, before returning to limbo. 
Slightly flustered, (Aha. It is possible to embarrass him. I'd have thought things like that happened to him all the time) Bert shuffled some unnecessary papers for a few seconds.

"Now, bit parts, " Bert continued. "I've noticed they are queuing up to join you; you have a reputation for making sure they always have food and shelter, unlike a lot of authors. Do you have any special requirements?"

The conversation trailed off into technicalities I won't bore you with. Instead, I'll bore you with some details about me.

I was written to be an author, for first person narrative, but my creator, the guy who wrote <b>me</b>, gave me permission to rewrite some of my own details. That is rare; most authors (even me) are so proud of the words they've written they wouldn't let an editor fiddle with them, let alone one of their own characters. 

That's how I fixed up my bad knees, which gave me far more flexibility in horse-riding cultures, and accepted weak ankles instead; good, well-laced boots could compensate for them.

But, even more than this, he let me edit <b>him</B>  how many authors would have that much confidence in their creations? I didn't change him much, just a slight improvement in his eyesight, so he could get around without spectacles, and a bit more depth and authority to his voice, which I took back out when we'd finished the editing.

Tubby and unfit, he panted round the quest with us, unwilling to let his physical disadvantages slow the rest of us down, and his friends must have been quite surprised at his fitness afterwards. What would have happened had he died on the adventure? I don't know, and I don't want to find out. Many characters have lived on after their creators' deaths, and some have even had further adventures, but none, to my knowledge, have been responsible for that death.

Anyway, my creator came out of the experience with new insight into what it meant to be a character (and better muscle tone, and lots of bruises), and no author can resist a new insight. Certainly I can't.

I promise you, my fictional and probably imaginary reader, that that was
less boring than our discussion as to how many secondary characters and
how many zombies (we're not talking real zombies here, but cyphers,
moving wallpaper, cut-out figures with no need for personalities) I'd be
needing to make my crowd scenes effective, then we took a cup of virtual
tea . 

I copied the folder containing the new companions I wouldn't
meet until I reached their part in the story, and closed the
CentralCasting window.

Now I just needed to get creative.

[*AUTHOR] Jonathan&nbsp;Joseph

[*BLURB] An epic fragment from Jonathan Joseph's <a href="http://www.kilbot.co.uk"
target=_blank><b>Workspace</b></a> blog.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Janahara Azad hates his job, his boss, and
his exo-suit, in that order. The first is unavoidable, the second
repellent, and the third tetchy, recalcitrant and intermittently
cooperative.

Three hours into an 18 hour shift: Madhom Bibir Hat averages 98%
humidity, 42 Celsius, and is mercilessly lit by a diffuse sun which
glints dully off the eternal mud. On the outskirts of the breaking yard
itself, for all the surrealism of the monstrous dead tech
littering the landscape and the insane levels of activity in the main
yard, it is a curiously peaceful place. A gentle wind blows a damp
breath on the machang shanty town that presses hard against
the yard perimeter. Naked toddlers play in the dust, tugging improbably
sized mech-scrap behind them like mute pets; groups of women in faded
sarees chat quietly in small groups by the compound gates. Appearances
aside, Madhom, like almost all places, has to be a home as well.
 
Nearly everything at Madhom suffers from scalar inferiority. Even the
biggest, brashest, blingest vehicle that rolls into the yard, pinging
metal betraying the speed of its trip from the Dhaka suburbs, is utterly
dwarfed by the giant metal corpses that dominate not only the skyline,
but the eyeline, the foreground and every other perspective. Blossoming
like a sooty flower in the wake of the global commerce combine, Madhom
is the epicentre of dead tech disposal in the third decade of the
twenty-first century. Historically, Madhom was a dumping ground for
unwanted merchant shipping tonnage, giant ships were rolled straight up
onto the gently sloping beaches, the salty air filled with a constant
undignified, wheezing, diesel swansong, then picked apart by swarming
groups of tiny brown figures, none with their full complement of fingers
or any discernible safety gear. 

<div=pullquote>It is during a particularly difficult removal of the buckled inner
airlock door that the accident happens</div>After decades of crunching huge ships into easily recyclable chunks,
powered by greed, blinkered convenience and a seemingly inexhaustible
supply of uncomplaining Bangladeshi men who would rather work and die
than just die, Madhom Bibir Hat in Chittagong is now the place for the
disposal of vast metal structures of all shapes and purposes. Most
recently, The Kashem Corporation, Janahara's employer, has moved into platform recycling. Winning a
lucrative, yet laughably small by Western standards, contract from
IDMessina Group (a WorkSpace subsidiary) in 2025, Kashem Corp now processes three to four redundant
oceanic oil drilling platforms per year. Despite a mortality rate of
nearly one hundred and fifty men per platform, and constant wrangling
with UN pollution inspection personnel, Kashem's owner Iqbal Karim
manages to maintain houses in nine capitals, a fleet of hydrogen-powered
Bentleys, and no minimum wage. 

Janahara works on commission, a paltry algorithm based on how much metal
his aging SARCOS exo-suit can gouge and chew from whichever rapidly
skeletonising steel carcass has most recently beached itself on the
desolate mud flats of the Bay of Bengal.  Janahara's suit, whilst
over fifteen years old and desperately in need of an overhaul, is
critical to his job. His SARCOS suit is a carapaced, hot-zone variant,
built in 2010 and designed for operation in NBC active zones; it is
ideally suited, when cooperative, to (slowly) reducing a million tons of
steel and assorted exotic materials into loads that will fit in the
flatbed of an Isuzu pickup. After demob in 2017 the suit was purchased
by a Scottish construction 
collective and retrofitted with a first generation  mobile AI. Barely
rating a sentience designation, and never upgraded, the suit has all the
intellectual finesse of a mongrel mutt displaced from its place by the
fireside, with a conversational repertoire to match. The suit is
eighth-hand to Janahara, and had never operated south of the equator
before Janahara slipped into its worn vinyl interior. Presumably it was
nice and warm for its northern operators, but its air conditioning
condenser has long since rotted away
and Janahara suffers miserably in the noonday sun of Madhom beach.
 
For the hundredth time this shift
Janahara wipes his face against the stinking towel tied to the defunct
chin monitor in the suit helmet and sucks down more brackish water from
the hamster tube. It is going to be
a long day.

<p class=drop>Janahara hates it when his boss visits; he sees it as a
fundamental breach of the uneven covenant between boss and crew. Stay
out of sight, you rich fucks. Laughably called the crew lounge (a
notional, nearly derisory, nod to UNEP recommendations), Kashem Corp
provides one small, sixteen square metre plywood break time shack. This
is perched on the boundary between the scrubby Chittagong shoreline and
the endless mud flats at the seaward entrance to the main Madhom
breaking yard; the crews call it, in a rare display of fatigue tinged
irony, the HQ. This small concession is served by a temperamental water
cooler and a wheezing, external aircon unit clumsily bonded to an
outside wall, a ten year old PV solar panel provides the power. Employee
benefits are a new concept in Chittagong and Iqbal (a self-styled
moderniser) is absurdly proud of this nod to modern Western work
practices, but unfortunately the basic genetics of the concept have been
somewhat lost in translation.  Inside, exhausted men, none with a body
mass index greater than ten, are flopped listlessly across several
pieces of broken furniture; sweat-oiled flesh squeaks against ancient
faux leather and a musty, foetid smell floats up from the mouldering
hide of a Chesterfield. Iqbal is expected at 1400 and has ordered
Janahara's team and two other crews to be present when he arrives,
fifteen men in total. Apparently, he has an announcement to make, the
men don't give a shit, any chance for a break is totally
exploited. Janahara parks his suit on
the makeshift veranda outside HQ, the SARCOS suit slumping corpse-like
on top of other discarded exo-suits - a latter day charnel pit, the
stench of sweat and hydraulic fluid replacing the ferric tang of blood. 

Janahara makes a beeline for the water cooler, the desalinator in HQ
provides considerably superior water to that of the filtered sweat and
urine that the exo-suits synthesise, and he stands chugging litres of
chilled heaven until a trigeminal spike of agony forces him to bend over
at the waist; ice cream headache is a common phenomena at break times in
Madhom. Ice cream isn't. Hydrated, Janahara slumps down in a shattered
garden lounger and waits for his illustrious leader. He gets a few nods
from his colleagues (another Iqbal terminology pretension) but no chat;
team building is generally discouraged at Madhom, mostly to maximise
productivity but also to reduce the risk of revolt. Iqbal Karim, whilst a repulsively obese and
morally bankrupt example of corporate greed, is not stupid. He has
considered the potential result of hundreds of bionically augmented,
terminally pissed-off serfs descending onto the yard management
compound. Iqbal theoretically has net control over the exo-suits, but
Madhom does not have the best record for net coverage uptime and the
huge metal salvage chunks that litter the yard tend to disrupt EM fields. 

A muted ululating hum signals the arrival of Iqbal's electric phaeton, a
long pause and protracted huffing, and then the door bangs open,
silhouetting Iqbal's dirigible form in the bright white light of the
Bengalese afternoon.

"Asalaam alaykum, men. No need to get up."

No one has moved. Iqbal mops at a streaming brow with a mildly scandalous silk
handkerchief; his moonlike face is framed
by the bright orange of his hennaed beard, and 
carries its usual expression of quasi-benevolent irritation.
Iqbal is nearly seventy but wealth and
easy living lends his podgy face a
baby-like smoothness. It is easy not to
like him and only the universally despised simpering orderlies show a fawning obsequiousness. "Special job
today, men. It's a rush job so a bonus is on offer; if you three crews
can decon the job before Saturday then there's a one thousand taka bonus
per man and a one day holiday."

Some stirring in the HQ at last, a thousand taka is nearly a week's pay and a day off: unheard of bliss. The
chance to sleep a little, eat leisurely and a maybe a little cricket in
the early evening. 

"It's an unusual job; Kashem has successfully bid for recyke on the
primary ISS module. Apparently it's too large for a re-entry cremation
and too risky to shoot down, so they're bringing it in for a splashdown
in the Andaman later this afternoon. One of our tugs will bring it in
first thing in the morning. I presume all you men will be up for it, it
will mean twenty-plus hour shifts for at least three days but, as I
said, there's a bonus. Kashem look after their crews."

This last hilarious inaccuracy sours his
self-satisfied momentum a little but the quiet hubbub that breaks out seems
good enough confirmation for Iqbal. He waddles
back towards his conveyance.  "I'll upload your suits with the
necessary schematics in the morning, I suggest you finish your shift
today as quickly as you can and get some rest."

A collective groan as bodies are unglued from the terrible furniture,
final glugs of water are swilled down from the cooler: suit internment
begins again.

<p class=drop>After years of brute demolition, basic rending and
tearing, Janahara's team is learning for the first time (unwillingly but
quickly) the art of incremental, non-destructive deconstruction. 

The briefing (another weird new concept) in the management compound at
Madhom had a core message: fuck up the decon and there would be no
bonus. It turns out that reducing an International Space Station life
support module (now Iqbal's casual, urbane reference to the ISS becomes clear) to its component, fiscally
useful, parts and materials was no cakewalk. The sandwich of steel,
Kevlar, ceramics and assorted exotic fabrics which kept the cosmonauts
protected in space only retained its salvage value if it was removed
layer by painstaking layer. To breakers who normally used brute suit
power to reduce ships and platforms to easily sellable scrap, the
thousand taka bonus is starting to look a
little lean. 

Iqbal has even gone as far as putting
together a Power Point presentation to ram home the message;
unfortunately he is apparently a novice
with basic office applications and has
saturated each slide with so much swoop-in animation and ambiguous font
choices that it is largely meaningless.
Still, sitting in an aircon office watching their bloated employer
fumbling with the controls of a laser projector beat trudging around in
mud in forty plus, so he had an attentive audience. In the end, though,
it was clear: decon the module, remove the components of the laminate
skin in sheets no smaller than one meter square, try not to get the
pieces muddy, do it by Saturday noon.
 
<p class=drop>So Janahara finds himself, at 1500 on day one of the deconstruction,
working with uncharacteristic finesse inside the nadir airlock of the
ISS module, delicately removing gossamer sheets of Kevlar from the
floor(?)/roof(?) of the structure. It's still horrible, sweaty, endless
work, and as the module is still suspended from the salvage crane that
hoisted it from the tug flatbed, gentle oscillations in the crane cable
means Janahara is suffering from intermittent inner ear nausea. It's not
all bad though. The module offers some shade from the sun and the lack
of gross mechanical movements keeps the fatigue to a manageable level. 
Even Janahara's suit seems to approve, normally gnomically taciturn, it
has actually expressed an opinion about the day's work: "I've got the
greatest enthusiasm and confidence in our work", and has even asked
after Janahara's well being, "How can I help you during this important
transition?", this second comment was a bit random but Janahara still
feels absurdly pleased with his dolt of a partner; he couldn't remember
a time when they had ever conversed about anything but the basic details
of the job at hand.

It is during a particularly difficult removal of the buckled inner
airlock door that the accident happens. The module is in a pretty sorry
state after its prolonged soak in the Andaman Sea and kelp and other
oceanic verdants have invaded every possible gap and chink in the warped
structure. Janahara is using a relatively new carbide buzz saw with an
insanely capable RPM rate to cut through the titanium hinges on the
nominally ventral side of the module when the crane cable gives way. A
sickening moment of freefall, a brief warped mirroring of the thousands
of graceful arcs the module had sketched in low earth orbit, the scream
of a runaway power tool, and then a crushing impact as the module concertinas into the compacted mud of the dry
dock. Janahara hears an oof, a muted shriek and a flare of agony in his
legs; then darkness takes him away for a while.

ISS modules are built for restraining fifteen bar of internal air
pressure, not load bearing over ten tons of mass at half terminal
velocity. Janahara regains consciousness and enters a world of pain,
heat, atomised seaweed, an Escher house of collapsed bulkheads and the
bleeping complaints of numerous automatic user warranty invalidation
alerts from his suit. He chins the alarm kill switch and takes stock.
Incredible searing pain from both legs: check. Visibility: zero. On
board suit systems: non responsive. Water tank, *suck*: empty. Janahara
slumps back in despair, he's seen a hundred yard accidents, and the
outcome is never good. A worker in Europe would, at about this stage, be
likely to be hearing the wail of emergency service vehicles and the
reassuring voice of a sober foreman. This is Chittagong. All he can hear
is the uninterrupted roar of decon machinery all around and the
impatient shouts of profit temporarily suspended.  He hears the still,
small, calm voice of his suit AI.

"Janahara, I can help you."

A sharp burning pain in the right side of his chest. A brief, condensed,
hypochondriac moment of heart attack anxiety. Then, only darkness.


<p class=drop>In his short and largely cheerless life, Janahara has
lacked a great many things; regular nourishment, more than one set of
clothes, a semblance of health care,  reliably potable water - to name a
few. Latterly though, he's realising just quite how thoroughly fucked
over he's been. Time itself, it seems, like all luxuries, is also the
preserve of those already benefiting from an existing level of corporeal
comfort. A myopic fixation on the scant privations of hand to mouth
existence does not allow choice, let alone an appreciation of it.
Janahara has never had the luxury of stability, or even a passing
familiarity with the rules by which to play; he has sat all his life in
a grey, dimly lit box which diffused all shadow. Today, he's breaking
out. The pure, annealing light that now fills
Janahara is a revelation of sorts,
but not one he is best placed to
immediately appreciate. His current transformation is largely a pharmacological one, the relief from pain a
result of world class medical intervention. His chapped lips are soothed
by refrigerated Icelandic mineral water, his deeper wounds are dressed
with expensive maggot debridement treatments, a nano salve soothes the abrasions on his left flank, and
both legs are cradled in smartweave, analgesic casts. Heaven, always a
divisive and personal condition, has come
fleetingly to Janahara. Later, as his eyes adjust
to the light, the source begins
to form into a vaguely identifiable shape: a huge window looking out,
from Janahara's prone position, onto a featureless pure blue sky, tiny
white birds flecking the endless azure. His universe is made up of
distilled monochromes; the blue sky, white walls, a whiter bed. He has
no idea of where he is and how he got there. All he knows and cares
about is that he's not at the Madhom yard; he gives into the drugs and
steps out of his body for a while. The doctors fill him in later; he's
got a lot of doctors, he can afford them, in fact, he can afford
whatever he wants. 

Earlier that day, seventeen minutes after the accident in the Madhom
yard, a Sikorsky heavy lifter thundered over Chittagong from the
northwest. Without bothering to touch down and ignoring the agog
workers, the flapping management goons and the handshake ping from the
yard security network, the Sikorsky lowered a spectra line and grapple
and simply winched the entire ISS module, Janahara, suit and all, into
the reddening afternoon sky. After eleven minutes of terrifying,
whirling flight, the Sikorsky dumped the module directly onto the
helipad on top of Dhaka National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation
Institute and lit off immediately. Responding to feeble shouts from
within the module hulk, the genteel surgeons of the DNOH were reluctant
at first to rush to the aid of this scabrous (obviously poor) invader
into their sterile enclave, but after a standard scan of his RFID tag
embedded under the skin of his right pectoral, things started to move
much more quickly. Specifically, Janahara became Mr. Azad when his
credit line was queried. He was swiftly shuttled from the public ER bay
to a private side room on the third floor, and from there to a maglev
enabled suite on the twenty-seventh.  Somewhere between being squashed
by several tons of obsolete multi-international space hardware, and
landing in a supersonic clatter of helicopter blades in the centre of
Dhaka, Janahara got rich.

Dear Hadas,<br> Just thought I would drop you a line, BIG news. It's
been a while anyway since we last corresponded and you know how I hate
meeting in the World, a technophobe to the end I suppose.<br> Anyway, my
work on the Azad project goes well; as well it should after three years
of research in six cities and two year-long Lorbital sabbaticals (much
praise to my crawler team as well, of course, and the admin here at
Lhasa is a genius with partials management, and naturally we all love
the bots). Your own contributions to the analysis of Janahara's
WorkSpace acquisition coup (amazing to think that an event nearly forty
years ago still resonates so strongly) continues to benefit us
enormously - so kudos to you too. It's slow work though, what a bloody
paranoiac he is! Janahara Azad has the most infuriatingly incongruous
nodal presence I have ever seen, it's like he's hardly there.
Continuously I have to try and reconcile his huge RL presence with his
"barely a ripple" impact on the net. I mean, come on, he's richer than
gods and most people can draw his face from memory - how does he keep
such a low dunked profile?! Well, this is why I was drawn to the work I
suppose, but what a frustrating enigma.<br> Forensic dead-ends aside
we've had something of a Holy Grail moment here this week. Last Thursday
I received a call from a probate lawyer in Dhaka, gentleman by the name
of Chandra, he said he had something that might interest me (my research
is reasonably well known in that city). Turns out that he had been
anonymously (curiouser and curiouser) sent a number of ancient media
files still in their original substrate (that alone is worth a train
journey to Dhaka; vintage silicon and plastic storage medium -
fascinating) that directly related to Azad's early life in Dhaka, he
intimated that they may even relate to his pre-accelerative life. He
wasn't able to (or wouldn't), offer any details about the provenance of
the files, but Chandra (obviously a typical canny lawyer) sent me a
chunk of one of the converted files as a taster. Well, suffice to say;
yesterday I got back from Dhaka on the maglev after a hectic two days in
Bangladesh. I've now blown the entire department's budget on Chandra's
files (he's no better than a shark TBH, but no matter) - the files are
genuine! I could go on and on about the importance of this find but it
would be easier just to show you. Please see below for a transcript of
what I think is the most important file (I've also attached the
converted file but given the age of the original coding some recipients
have requested a transcript, so I preempted you asking the same.)<br> 
Anyway, read on, tenure is assured, old
friend. Best regards, D.

[*ITEM] Survivor 

[*AUTHOR] Peter	Morrison

[*BLURB] CAUTION: Contact with aliens may damage your health.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The door swings closed behind Lei Bliley, the latch falling into place
with a click; she turns the key in the lock, listens to the home
security systems come online. Then she stands for a moment, practicing
breathing, something that at this moment remains more of a challenge
than she is particularly happy about. She has been out walking,
exploring the city, looking at the world anew in light of her recent
travels. General Oscar Morse had wanted to keep her under lock and key
deep in the basement of the facility at all times. But the
psychiatrist, Dr Angelique Charles, had argued, insisting that Lei was
scarred, that it was a miracle she had survived, or at least had
survived as intact as she had, and that to cage her would be the final
straw. Dr Charles had insisted that under those conditions Lei would break.

<p class=drop>None of the others had survived - Hounjet, Panocha and Iteif were all
dead, fragments of bodies returned through the gate; if they wanted
to get anything out of Lei then they would need to take infinite care
of her body and mind. Lei tended to feel that she would have preferred
that they hadn't had that conversation in front of her, even if she
was thankful for the space that it granted her. 

<div class=lpullquote>Something out
there is tracking her, something out there knows where she is, at least.</div>The trip through the Gateway changed everything; anything she can tell them
is important,
Lei understands that, but her memories are fragmented, and
disturbing. Nevertheless, Lei doesn't want to be treated
like a broken child, even if that is how she feels sometimes, though
very little of that is what you would call her fault. The space and
patience are
essential to her wellbeing, that is clear to her every time she tries to move, let alone go
out.

It's not as
if she isn't still being
monitored 24 hours a day - the chip they injected under the skin of her
forearm, the shadows that follow her through the streets, shadows housed next door
so they are only minutes away at any time. She certainly appreciates Dr.
Charles' efforts on her behalf, for all the compromises and balances
that have resulted. The fact that her memories of what happened are
fractured, are far from complete, is something which enrages General
Morse. She can tell, even if he does his best to
keep his temper under control. Those memories which do linger of what
happened are far from pleasant. Her dreams are filled with flashes of
the first contact, of her attempts to communicate, of the screams of her
colleagues. What uncertain horror had made such professional veterans
of space and Exploratory Division missions so hysterical, so distressed?

Lei was a language specialist, finishing her doctorate at Tokyo
University, when she was recruited by a branch of military intelligence
and research. The Space Orbital and Extra Dimensional Exploratory
Directorate was a department she had never heard of before, but then
it wasn't exactly an area that she had had previous dealings with. She
was recruited, sworn to secrecy and then they had told her the
absolute bare minimum. She had hesitated; the surgery that was
proposed was extensive, and not something they had mentioned on first
approach, waiting till they had her tied up with contracts and
conspiracies. They offered more money than she could ever dream of,
and then there was the prestige of being an expert in a new language,
one of the few people on the planet to be able to speak an alien
tongue. There had been others before her, who had failed to fulfil the
mission requirements, though she had never been told in
what way they had failed to live up to those requirements.

So she had signed up, and started to learn the language through
intensive sessions, from documents, from the transcripts of dreams. It
had seemed absurd to her, the very idea that the alien language had
been derived from dreams! Never had she thought to ask, where do these
dreams come from, who are these people afflicted by dreams of alien
worlds, and what is it like to experience these things? She took it
for granted, the transcripts which she was provided with, the notes
supplied without context. 

Now she has become one of those who dream nightly
of horrors; part of this is clearly the memories she has buried from her
visit, part of it is that her brain has been opened, and something out
there is transmitting directly into her mind every night. Something out
there is tracking her, something out there knows where she is, at least.
That is how she feels, the impression she has, lying there alone at
night, drenched in sweat, waiting to see if tonight is the night he
comes for her.

But she had done her job, went
through the motions, asked no questions, knowing she would get no
answers, and gradually over time she had cracked the language. The
syntax had been torturous to learn, word structures beyond anything
she had previously encountered, a language that was truly alien, but
as time passed she could actually make some sense of the patterns.

"Bath," she calls, listening for the initial, heavier splash, lessening
as the water starts to collect. They have housed her in an apartment
with all the latest facilities, in of one of the city's towers - a
government-owned office building with accommodation located securely at
the top - with a breathtaking view if she were to stand at the window
and look out. Certainly it has everything she could ask for, and more.
She has taken steps to reduce the input from the building's AI - she has
no desire for machine communications. The irritating voice constructed
from a bank of recorded words, with its faux concern for her health has
had to be switched off, feeling too invasive. With her unquiet thoughts
she craves silence, she craves peace. She tugs at the first straps,
taking her time as they come free, buckle by buckle. She has to handle
everything with care, the slightest hurry and she would bruise, the
slightest scrape and she would bleed. They did things to her body before
they travelled, engineered her for a different gravity, tweaked systems
to breathe different atmospheres. They had told her that this was the
first planet they had discovered with this new technology. The planet
was called Slu gishgo Dhom; she had told them that, derived from the
words she had studied, Lei having gone further with the language than
those who had gone before her.  

While they boasted about the discovery,
they never revealed how they had discovered
the gateway, the world on the other side - how many failed explorations
had there been? How many failed trips, dead ends, and false leads had
there been? What kind of probe systems were they using in order to
collect the kind of data that was at the root of the work they did to
her? Part of her had wondered how reliable was this data? That was, like
everything else, a secret. So she never said anything out loud,
surrounded as she was by people who seemed very convinced of the
knowledge they had, and the power that not sharing gave them. Though now
Lei had her suspicions that certain things had an inevitability of their
own - perhaps there had been no other explorations, perhaps before the
dreams of that planet leaked into human heads there had been nothing?
Over-confident bastards, Lei cursed. How many of them would suffer the
way that she did now? How many them would be tormented and devoured by
the chilling sight of the alien? Each night she dreamt the answer to
those questions  many would suffer.

She hangs the torso harness in its charger by the door. Flexes too-long 
fingers, to work out the feeling of stiffening. Still not used to
the way her skin was discoloured by alien skies, the burnt out red sun
tinted her an ash grey, something else to add to the list of things
they wanted to sample and prod - collecting flakes of skin and hair
samples, daily syringes of blood. She runs one hand across the other,
runs a hand to her elbow, flexes again, and another stroke. Constantly
convinced she can brush the changes away, or at least feel the
difference beneath her finger tips. She can't, it feels like flesh,
just flesh. She winces, closes her eyes, takes slow abrasive breaths.
The latest spike of pain flashes through her, she rubs her temples.
Her skull feels too close to the surface, somehow warped and out of
shape. It seems as though veins pulse there, each circuit a physical pain,
so that Lei suspects her head will implode at any moment.

She had been changed too much, what has she now become? Human, or
alien, or some absurdist hybrid, some missing link found between the
two? Is it any wonder that people stare at her as she walks through
the bustle of the city streets? Her warm ash grey skin, intense red
eyes. They made her too tall, too thin, and now she needs the
exo-harness in order to walk any distance. The frame keeping her
upright even during the worst of the pain. Through streets awash with
rain and neon, she feels now as though every day is an alien encounter.
These strange humans, flesh she used to know, rushing through
underground tunnels and colossal concrete structures. It all takes on
a sheen of the unknown.

They had adjusted her brain, her eyes, so that she could cope with the
sleeping planet - its environment green and brown, waves crashing
against sluggish shores where the gateway had deposited them. Strange
structures, riddled with the written form of the alien language. Alien
geometries that would never be entirely knowable, would never feel
entirely real. Do what you want with surgery, with training; you could
never get over that kind of "alien". Huge doorways, and Lei had been
surprised how easily the first had opened beneath Ambassador Hounjet's
touch, a career diplomat assigned to the mission, and trained in the
new field of first contact. The darkness had been alive, within a
pulsing slumbering form. Shari Hounjet had slapped her, while Dr.
Maarten Panocha looked on embarrassed, and Sergeant Hayk Iteif
remained neutral. Hounjet told her to pay attention, to stay focused
on him and his words, then he had started shouting, and the alien had
woken as Lei translated his words blindly.

In one ear out the other, Lei looked into the building again, had seen
tentacles, piercing red eyes, strange hoofed hands, she had heard the
flap of thick leathery wings. She had felt faint. She had felt sick.
"To me, pay attention to me," Hounjet had snapped at her again, and
she had focused on him as the alien words came. The language spoken by
a native was entirely different from what she had studied. Her mind
raced, flailing to keep up with the words, to make some form of sense
from them. They had come stumbling from her mouth, only in that last step
from her brain to her mouth clicking into place in a way that seemed
to make sense. That in the process seemed to be actually changing her
thought processes with each spoken syllable. "I am awakened. Chairman
Hu. I am. Awakened from deep slumber." Lei can't remember what she said
after that. Dr.Panocha had started screaming, while Ambassador Hounjet
fell to his knees, clawing at his eyes, and Sergeant Iteif had tried
to run. And Lei had continued to translate word for word the full
extent of the alien's response to the humans' intrusion, like a
puppet. No longer operating under her own volition. No longer
conscious of her own actions. The same way she had finally staggered through the gate home some
time after, and the next thing she remembers is the soldiers who
caught her and offered support.

There are rails along the walls, Lei uses them to support herself, to
pull herself along towards the bath. The exo-suit stripped, the
protective padding left behind; she shivers a little from the cold,
from the memory, from any number of involuntary reactions. She
anticipates the bath, in the same way as she hoped that it would rain
when she was out. Moisture reminds her of there, and soothes her,
warm atmosphere more suited to the body she finds herself in now. She
eases into the bath, taking great care, conscious of just how fragile
she is, lets the water cradle her and hold her, and envelop her.

"What happened next?" Morse asked her again and again, over and over,
every day, the good cop / bad cop interplay of Charles and Morse. With
Sundays off for good behaviour she takes advantage of being allowed
out to walk the city streets. A chorus of clicks and whirrs with every
step, she recalls, closing her eyes, hoping the water takes her away
from it all. Heads turning at every sound, stolen glances taking in
her human alien form, whisperings and confusion stalking her progress.
She brushes her body again, fingers exploring muscular pains, and
doing their best to offer relief. Plunging limbs beneath the surface,
before weakly swirling them around, embracing the tentative therapy
that offers. As the liquid warmth takes her into its embrace she
closes her eyes and sighs deeply, sliding in and down to her neck.
Perhaps she is crying now, it would not be the first time, but she is
trying to keep on top of the sensation, resist self-pity. Though for
all that, the idea of cutting her wrists and sinking into death passes
through her mind again. It is unlikely she actually would though; she
is confident the AI would trigger an alarm - undoubtedly it could
drain the bath in seconds and refill it with suspension foam,
undoubtedly in one of the neighbouring apartments where they have the
shadows housed there will be a medic; undoubtedly they have
analysed each potential scenario more thoroughly than she could.

<p class=drop>Lei finds that she has been dozing in the bath, fatigue having caught
up with her. The water is still lukewarm, so she can't have been off
for too long. Yet it feels oddly nice, to have had a moment of peace.
She pulls herself to a standing position, pushes the button that
drains the bath, pushes the button which produces the hot air to dry
her. Clinging there as she is buffeted like a fallen leaf by the warm
blasts that come from all around her. Shivering, she steps onto the
floor, lowers herself to the bath edge and sits there, holding
herself, before building up the determination to get dressed for bed,
to see if she can get some proper sleep. Knowing with certainty that this
will absolutely not happen, but still having the resolve that she must
pretend to be as normal as she can. As she goes through these motions
she recalls this afternoon's walk, how there had been a different mood
to the city, a different buzz in the air. People had seemed too
distracted to pay her too much attention, she had passed some people
standing staring into the sky, hobbling by with her clicking
contraption, and they didn't even look. Perhaps she should have paid
more attention, but she had enough problems without being concerned by
trivia. Perhaps tonight will be different, she yawns.

Lei pulls herself along, using the bars, till she gets to her bedroom,
tottering with each step, a helpless child relearning the art of
walking. Reaching the bed, she crawls up, managing to cocoon herself in
the thin blanket, curling into a ball, wrapping around herself.
Closing her eyes, she steadies her breathing, absorbed in meditation
techniques she has been taught to focus and relax. As with every
night, this is enough to allow her to get to sleep in the first
instance. But it is a restless sleep; she rolls from one side to the
other, approaches awakening, hovers and dives back into dreams. Murky
images, eyes staring, alien voices insinuating themselves into her
head, strange lights, strange structures half glimpsed.

At last, inevitably, she finds herself awake, breathing heavily,
aching inside. That interminable presence lurking in her head, thick
and malevolent, like dirty fingers sifting through her thoughts, like
tentacled caresses. She half sits, chest heaving, spikes of pain, 
and she struggles with each breath. It takes her a
moment to notice - the silence; the darkness. From her window she can
see the city lights, hear the odd city sound now and then. In her apartment
there is always some sound, the subliminal hums and clicks of modern
living. The moon hangs in the sky, sickly and discoloured; to a degree its
diseased pallor describes a feeling that is growing in her. The silence is a blanket that becomes claustrophobic,
"lights!" she calls out. Nothing. Darkness. Silence. The feeling that
there is something in her head grows. She is not alone. There is
something here. At last.

Then, a sound, a slithering, a shuffling. He is here. At last. Beneath
this gibbous moon, the Chairman has come for her. Lei closes her eyes.
There was only one way that this could end, and she has known it all
along. Anticipation. They rebuilt her to travel to Slu gishgo Dhom,
the Chairman rebuilt her to return to Earth. They poked and prodded
her, tried to undo some of what had been done to her. With their
mastery of human engineering, they could not make her human again,
they could not undo the alien work. She was the Chairman's creature,
and he has come for his youngest child. Lei climbs out of bed, wobbles
in place, then gathers herself, stands steady, finding a strength she
hasn't felt in a long time. He has come for her, shuffling through
this human structure, tracking her as though she were a beacon returned to
Earth. Her presence guiding him, through dimensional fabrics. She
takes a breath, filled with a near crippling sense of anticipation.
The door opens; with a wet slapping sound, moist drops plop to the
floor, eyes red and piercing stare at her from the dark. A tentacle
furls out, lazily, brushes past her face, she smiles.

[*BLURB] A police procedural story set in the near future.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>In his cramped cube, Bernham wished that he
was out on the streets, in the cool March wind. Spring was on its way,
but winter was not leaving without a fight. The icy breeze whipped
against the downtown skyscrapers, sending papers and other detritus
skittering across the empty streets. The bobbing of the propeller-mounted 
cameras jerked his vision mightily. Bile rising in his throat,
he slugged the remaining coffee from his soggy cup. He assured himself
that the smell of liquor was not emanating from his pores. He assured
himself that no one knew.

Inner City Dispatch Officer Bernham, formerly Western District Homicide
Detective Bernham, watched the pursuit on his monitor. It was a standard
scene on his downtown surveillance beat; some junky degenerate hoofing it
furiously down the middle of an empty street, usually with some bulky
piece of high end tech in tow. In this case it looked to be some kind of
super-executive grade G/G Unit, maybe one of those hubs that allowed a
whole floor to goggle wirelessly. Bernham didn't know, exactly, and he
was sure this junky didn't, either.  He wondered why they, the criminals
he monitored, always chose to steal things they could barely carry,
never anything portable or easily concealed. As always, he pitied their
inverted junky logic.  After a few blocks, the junky pounded the
pavement with less vigor. He stomped to a stop, as quickly as he had
been running. The coaxial cables that had been swinging behind him,
slapping at his skinny calves as he ran, swung to a halt. His shoes
looked more than a few sizes too large.  The great-idea grin left his
face and was replaced by the all too familiar what-the-fuck-am-I-doing
grimace. Bernham stifled a yawn. He punched a sequence, dispatching
nearby units.

Like tumbling dice, they rolled into view from the edges of his monitor.
Lithe and fluid, there were two of them.  Lilywhites. They pedaled with
pure focus, single-minded, synchronized in their efforts, white
wind-suits snapping elegantly.   The smaller of the two, probably about
seventeen years old, pulled ahead, passing the junky, now wide-eyed with
terror, boxing him in. The junky fell to his knees in fear. As they
secured the junky's wrists with plastic zip ties, Bernham instructed the
teens to proceed immediately to the nearest processing station.  As
protocol dictated, he reminded them to proceed directly.  They glared
indignantly at the camera hovering above them. 

As pawns, the Lilywhites were a dream. They were cheap, non-union,
non-specific labor, willing to do the dirty work.  Their effectiveness
was rooted in their living in these streets themselves. The Lilywhite
model had sprung from the mind of a particularly inspired chief, who had
since retired.  The formation of the Lilywhite Youth Initiative, as it
was formally known, was his response to the threat that the city faced
when young malingerers came to inhabit the downtown area upon its
closure. His reasoning:  that payment of the potential native criminal
element, in the form of grocery debits, music downloads, and other
non-liquid forms of currency, would offset their criminal proclivities
and, at the very least, prevent an organized criminal element from
taking root.  The result was the equivalent of day labor for law
enforcement and it was about as effective as it sounded. It was for this
reason that Bernham's job existed, that he was allowed to remain on the
force. He kept them on task, ensuring no fuck-ups under their limited creativity.

<div class=pullquote>not quickly enough to
miss the very malnourished child that began to chase the dog with what
looked to be a sharpened wooden baseball bat</div>Bernham took his time with booking.  The longer he could make it last,
the quicker time would pass until lunch.  If he could make it to lunch,
he would have survived the majority of the day's boredom. Afternoons
tended to pass quickly because there was paperwork he could fill out,
indicating to the following shift that nothing happened on his shift.
The other dispatchers envied Bernham and his shit detail.  They were
generally up to their asses with hard dispatches and afforded little
room to breathe.  But because Bernham had turned the wrong heads and put
his fingers in the wrong eyes, he got to guard a ghost town.  His sector
was the most abandoned and depleted in the city. In general, he baby-sat
squatters and deviants that wanted as much to be left alone as Bernham
wanted to leave them alone. 
 
He cycled through his various cams lazily, his face squished up as it
rested in his palm.  For a long stretch, the cams hovered steadily,
which meant there was no motion to be captured.  Once, around eleven,
after his fifth cup of coffee and second piss, he got some motion on one
of the hover-cams well inside his perimeter. It was among the
skyscrapers, very densely urban terrain and long abandoned. He clicked
through to find a scrappy looking dog, sifting through trash. It
scuttled away with something in its mouth that looked gray and very
inedible. He clicked over to the next cam, but not quickly enough to
miss the very malnourished child that began to chase the dog with what
looked to be a sharpened wooden baseball bat.  He suddenly felt
insufficiently intoxicated to do work this grim.  <I>Well, that's
fucking <b>it</b></I>, he thought to himself. He would duck out for an
early lunch, maybe a drink or two. The afternoon would be longer, but
fuck it. He would be halfway in the bag, anyway.

He was in his jacket when he heard the chattering of the PDA USB'd to
his desktop.  It pulsed in the familiar rhythm that he recognized as the
alert to a new text. It seemed like years since he'd heard that rattle,
but it had only been months. PDAs were standard issue for street work.
He hadn't bothered to turn his in when he got reassigned.  In the
whirlwind that followed Copeland's death, his PC had been boxed up
altogether and moved to this new cube, the main power cord being the
only cord to be unplugged. The PDA had slipped his mind in all the
mayhem that ensued, following his unceremonious desking.  He'd forgotten
he'd even had the thing.  Holding it now, though, he was briefly
comforted by its familiar heft.  He thumbed to the mailbox icon, opened
it. Just a number listed, so it wasn't in his contacts.

<span class=t1>Might have something for you here boss </span> the message read.

Bernham hated texting. He dialed the number back. It didn't ring, but
went right to a recording that told him the device he dialed could not
receive calls. It was probably one of those burners that only did data.
He texted back: <span class=t1>Who is this? </span>

Nothing.  Bernham pocketed the PDA.  He was relieved to see the sergeant
goggled and gloved, poking at the air, as he passed his office, on his
way to the bar.

<p class=drop>The backlight of the PDA illuminated Bernham's face in the
dimly lit dive.  He sat at the far end of the bar, away from the five or
so people that were actually eating the greasy swill that this place
served.  He scrolled through his old emails, free hand clutching his
drink, amazed that only half a year had passed since he was on the
streets doing real police work with a real partner.  His drinking hadn't
really gotten much worse since Copeland was killed. Without a partner to
justify it, though, it was starting to seem that way. It was a fact that
after looking at grimness and fatality day in and day out, police, in
general, and murder police, specifically, needed something to close the
distance between all that carnage and the land of the living.  And with
this line of thought his hand went out and he reflexively called out to
the bartender for another. 

The PDA chattered against the bar. A new message.  This time a picture.
It was a grainy shot of a man in an expensive-looking trench coat. The
man's face was indistinguishable, but, from his stocky frame, he
immediately recognized the man as Paul Darwin. Indeed, it was the figure
that seemed to be behind his eyes at every moment since Bernham walked
him out of that shipping container, stepping over his partner's dead
body. He immediately felt his ears burning, as if allowing himself to
even think the name made Darwin's existence more real. He fired a text
back: <span class=t1>Who the fuck are you? Don't fuck with me </span>.

The reply came immediately: <span class=t1>Thought that was your man.  I'm on Fifth.
I'll stay on him. </span>

Bernham texted back: <span class=t1>Who are you??</span>

He paid the bill and left.

On his way back into the office, he saw the sergeant lingering near his
cube. A confrontation was unavoidable.  "Bernham, how goes it? Early
lunch, I see," the sergeant said. 

"My posts were secured," Bernham said, his tone defensive.

"Sure, sure. My concern is the booze on your breath.  Anyhow, it's not
like you can do much damage in dispatch." The sergeant grinned, "Back to
it, then."  There was a long pause, broken as the sergeant slapped
Bernham's back. The sergeant, Bernham was sure, shared the feeling that
Bernham was to blame for his partner's death.  In the midst of the
Copeland fallout, at the apex of rumor and controversy, when the
sergeant was called in on the meeting with the public relations people,
the Chief, Bernham, and Bernham's Union rep, the sergeant swore up and
down that Bernham would never have a place in his unit.  The rep calmly
asked Bernham to leave the room and the sergeant emerged fifteen minutes
later, smiling and welcoming Bernham aboard.  Bernham winced at the
politicking done in his name.

Bernham keyed in to the vicinity of Fifth. Camera perspectives filled
the screen, dividing the monitor's display into thirty-six neat squares.
This setup was a far cry from the obsolete tech Bernham used in the
ghetto for his day to day. The cameras here were mounted, each dedicated
to its own position, no need to chase targets from a wobbly prop-cam.
The way all the viewpoints moved simultaneously, it reminded Bernham of
chattering bees.

This was an upscale neighborhood, mainly gentrified real estate
populated by the tech set, miles from Bernham's beat in more ways than
one. The cameras generally went unused because actual officers
maintained a presence here. The cameras acted as more of a support tool.
Their output, because they actually recorded, in addition to monitoring,
could be used as evidence when crimes took place, though that was
probably rare, given the upper crust population.  He saw a few civilians 
milling around, pushing strollers,
wheeling bags of groceries from the corner market, but nothing out of
the ordinary. It took him a few minutes, but he found Darwin on camera
six. In motion, he looked bigger than Bernham remembered, different
after only six months. 

Gone was the palsied, malnourished gait of the awkward man-child he had
cuffed and walked out of the shipping container turned high tech warren,
from which he had singlehandedly stolen millions from the most powerful
multinational in the world.  After spending months goggled and gloved,
carefully moving money from the virtual coffers of BigShop to his own
IInternet pirate's cove, the irony was lost on no one that the only
physical casualty of Darwin's intricately high tech pillage came from
the shotgun that crudely booby-trapped the door to his hideout. That
casualty was Copeland, Bernham's partner. Having been appointed a defense
team of expensive lawyers
by the very people from whom he stole, Darwin was recruited by BigShop
to patch the cracks by which he gained entry.  According to the
newsfeeds, he had been at BigShop bunker ever since. Though his world of
hackers had shamed him for selling out, it was obvious that he took
pleasure in his new legitimacy. His arrest had given him instant
celebrity, but his subsequent acquittal and hiring by BigShop had
launched him into Mega-Stardom.  Rumors of his sexual preferences
front-paged the tabloids and news sites.  Truthfully, it was these
proclivities that first put Darwin on Bernham's radar. He rolled his own
investigation into the BigShop thing, when he realized he didn't have
anything from the sex angle that would stick. Darwin was the product of
a new corporate culture. People like Darwin, at one time, would've been
litigated against to the law's most nebulous extent, as a warning to
potential imitators. Now, the Darwins of the world were embraced as a
form of damage control. The antiquated notion of punishment and justice
having been precluded by the devil you know philosophy and the need of
BigShop and every other multinational to grapple and claw for what
little advantage they could find amid the static of massive inflation
and widespread poverty. Darwin now exuded what could only be called
confidence, steadiness.

Bernham scanned the surrounding blocks, trying to find a follow
that could have sent the pics. He made him immediately, a block
behind Darwin. He was white, but out of place in this part of the city.
Tall and lanky, he tried to keep a low profile, but he couldn't suppress
his ghetto swagger. It was that gait of overcompensation that comes from
growing up poor in a place that doesn't matter to anyone that matters.  He
couldn't stifle his teenage goofiness, though, among these
self-important yuppies. The boy's attempt amounted to a sort of plodding
caricature of a hurried business man. Bernham pictured him at one of the
upscale cafés nearby, raising eyebrows when he picked up the wrong fork
for his salad course. Bernham tried to make the kid, eventually figuring
out the zoom controls on these cameras, higher tech than he was used to.
Though vaguely familiar, Bernham did not recognize him.  He pulled his
cell and texted the informant's number: <span class=t1>I see
you, chickenshit. Leave the cop stuff to the cops.</span>

He had his confirmation. The kid reached into his pocket and pulled out
a cell phone, a high-end burner from the looks of it, they came cheap so
they could be used and tossed, usually by drug dealers.  He read the
message and looked around till he spotted the camera. He nodded his
salutations, as if welcoming Bernham to the chase, then kept on in
Darwin's direction. 

<span class=t1>I know you can read. Who the fuck are you? What's Darwin to you? </span>
Bernham texted.

The boy read the text as he walked on; his fingers set to motion,
tee-nining it, putting Bernham's ham fisted letter by letter to shame.
Before the backlight was out from the last sent message, Bernham's PDA
vibrated with the reply: <span class=t1>He's just another asshole that owes. Figure
I'd collect before he's back in the wind.</span> 

<span class=t1>And what do you want with me? Backup? Pack it in or I'll have you tossed.</span>

<span class=t1>Go ahead. I didn't think you'd forget that easy. Don't you even want to
know where he's going?</span>

<span class=t1>I didn't forget shit. Darwin's been anointed. Where's he going? This
some kind of drug thing?</span>

<span class=t1>It's against the law to sell drugs, officer. Anyway, I'm on some
personal shit, here. He's headed to Craig Street from the looks of it.</span> 

Craig Street. It was the bloodiest of the bleeding edge. Only a block or
two from the University, it was where the tech kids lived, where they
did their frequently world-changing extra-curriculars.  Funded by
university grants, students did work that was not yet named in their
Craig Street apartments. It often concerned, among other high concept
vagaries, alternative methods of trafficking data across the net. It was
stuff that would be illegal if the lawmakers could wrap their heads
around it. It was stuff that made many of the students obscenely rich
before they even graduated.  By keeping it outside of university walls,
the school could claim at least partial ignorance of how its grant money
was spent.  If nothing came of it, it increased the knowledge base, at
least. If it did have legs, the initial investment was kicked back in
the form of high profile donations. It worked for the school either way.
Technologically, it kept them at the forefront. Money-wise, they stayed
flush enough to implement all the cool toys that were developed with
their seed money.

Bernham watched the kid look up at the camera and look back down at his
burner. Bernham's PDA shook in his hand. <span class=t1>I don't have all day to clue
you in. If I'm on this alone, then you can't come to the party. Sorry.</span>
He watched the kid toss the burner into a garbage can.  He pulled something
else from his pocket, too big to be another phone.  The kid stopped
walking long enough to wave at the camera and pressed a button. The
video feed was replaced by an error message on Bernham's screen. One by
one, the feeds were replaced by the message until he was staring at a
grid of useless royal blue.

<p class=drop>As he approached the sergeant's half-shut door, he could
see the sergeant inside, goggled up, fingers languidly stroking the air
in front of him, as though he were manipulating an invisible puppet. His
mouth half open, as well, no doubt, though Bernham couldn't see it with
the sergeant's back to him. That weird evil wizard hand gesture was one of the many
things that Bernham thought made the goggle-and-glove interface so
ridiculous.  It was even more ridiculous to him that through those
goggles, the sergeant was seeing an approximation of the very office in
which he sat, but geo-spatially tagged, with all kinds of widgets and
productivity tickers.  There was more to it than that, but, spending
most of his time on the street, Bernham had never needed to learn. They
could stop him from quitting, but they couldn't force him to learn, even
now.  He would ride this desk dispatch thing out till his retirement and
be one of the last officers to collect a pension.  No more waves, he
thought. Fuck waves. He knocked softly, so as not to startle the
sergeant. "What is it," the sergeant said.

"It's Darwin. He's back in town."

"Bernham?"  The sergeant removed the goggles. He rubbed his eyes indignantly.

"Darwin's back. I think something is up."

"Something's up, huh? With Darwin," he sipped his coffee. Bernham could
tell what was coming next. He swallowed hard. "The Darwin that killed
your partner?  The Darwin that, after killing your partner, got
recruited by BigShop and left this whole department looking like a
fucking joke? And you know this how?"

"I got a tip." Bernham felt sheepish under the sergeant's glare.

The sergeant stifled a laugh. "A tip, huh? Did he hold up a sign for you
to see on your monitor while you were babysitting those Lilywhite
psychos?"

"He's not in my sector."

"Of course he isn't. And you want to go check it out for yourself right?
Now's your chance to score one for the good guys? Maybe he'll roll up on
some of the Big Shop execs, we can arrest everyone. Let's get to it,
then. If we start now we can make it to the bar by happy hour." The
sergeant's sarcasm was palpable. Bernham said nothing. He felt his ears
burn, his fists clench.

"Let me be unequivocal, Bernham. You're a fuckup. You might have some
police instinct, sure, but you can't get with the program. You're
just... Let me ask you something, when you were detailed on that BigShop
thing, looking for Darwin that first time, and you and Copeland were on
the docks  and you finally knew you had him in that container, what did
you do?"

"We thought that if we were onto him from the tech angle he would be
onto us. We were right, too. He was in the process of dumping
everything."

"Yes, you were right. And you went in despite requests to wait for
backup. Now your partner's dead. It's feels good to feel right, doesn't
it, Bernham? It must feel good to look at a monitor all day too, half
drunk like some assfuck security guard."

"So fire me," Bernham said.

The sergeant laughed. "You know we can't. We like feeling right, too,
Bernham.  If we fired you, every news feed in the world would be on this
department about how we like to cut corners, how we don't trust our men
to do it right, how we caved to BigShop and whatever else." He spit the
words at Bernham as though they tasted bitter in his mouth. "So, here
you stay. You still get a city paycheck and not one of those cheesy
debit cards that the temps and the Lilywhites get. It could be worse."

The sergeant was wrong, though. It couldn't get worse than this. If
Bernham was driven by some sort of pride in righteousness, he received
no joy from it. It felt insulting, especially because he knew that
everyone secretly agreed with him on some level, in some impractical
place where logic was superseded by ethic. Bernham's sense of right flew
in the face of that of the world at large. His beliefs were anti-matter
to the order of things and for him to feel anything, to stand for
anything, definitively created chaos for him. Bernham had, since he
could remember, always found himself situated squarely against any given
grain. Circumstance came at him, fists clenched and teeth bared, and he
knew nothing but to lean into it. It got him nowhere. 

The sergeant had tuned in on the worst part of Bernham's job, of his
life, even. He was never allowed to simply walk away from these battles.
There were many other things along the way and now there was this. His
zeal had gotten his partner killed. Maybe worse, it had left Bernham as
a meaningless symbol of a system that had long since let the bullies and
bastards win. The department had to make a big show of supporting the
decisions of its officers, though, no matter how grave the consequences,
keeping him in this rent-a-cop limbo.

The sergeant sat there in silence, sizing Bernham up. He pursed his lips
and sucked air through his teeth. "You look sick. If you feel the need,
take a half day. Do what you need to do, but know this: should any harm
come to Darwin, while in our fair city, I'm going to come after you,"
the sergeant said. Whether he was being pitied, or, worse, dismissed as
a non-threat, Bernham didn't care. He saw his chance. He was out the
door before the sergeant could change his mind.

<p class=drop>Craig Street was plainly college kids only, though it
didn't appear any less moneyed than the neighborhoods which surrounded
it. The cars on this street were older, some Saabs, but mostly Hondas
and Volkswagens. Ratty couches on the porch indicated different
priorities than those of the adjacent community.  Many of these young
geeks would move only a few blocks upon graduation and it would be like
they moved a world away. They would go on to run the world, rewriting
the rules that been changed so many times before. Bernham kicked a Pabst
can into the gutter.  

Nothing seemed too out of the ordinary here. Bernham was well onto Craig
Street where, as he expected, things were at their most natural. Streets
got that way at their midpoint, Bernham found; the midpoint being the
furthest from surrounding influence.  Some kids laughed on the porch,
plastic cups in hand. He smelled pot, faintly, and heard a guitar. It
was calm and quiet. He remembered when he was young, how the first
reprieve from winter gave cause for celebration, even though it was
known the weather would cool one last time.  The river birches on the
street had begun to bud. Bernham thought he heard birds.  In the
distance, coming from Fifth, he heard sirens squeal to life. His PDA
vibrated, lit up with the coordinates of the nearest disturbance. The
GPS on his PDA was linked to incident reports and dispatched
accordingly. Shots fired on Craig, no more specific than that. He could
see the patrol car now, coming from where he came. He held up his PDA,
as was the custom, signaling the patrol car to pick him up. The car blew
past him, leaving him behind.

Bernham arrived at the scene, winded. He saw the texter, dead on the
ground, now wearing a wind suit of bright white, the uniform of a
Lilywhite.  A puddle of crimson blossomed across his stomach, pooling
around a hole near the zipper. He was gut shot.  Up close he appeared
much younger than he did on camera. He was perhaps sixteen, tall and
awkward. The gun he held seemed large in his hand. Two officers were
already on the porch, cuffing the boy that had done the shooting.
Bernham had missed the action.  Bernham felt the inside pocket of his
jacket, where he usually kept his latex gloves. He still had some,
months since having needed them. He pulled them on, feeling something
familiar yet foreign.

He made notes of the scene in his PDA and snapped a few pictures. He
rolled the body over to check the pockets and found a wallet. It was
embroidered with white text, in that old English style the Los Angeles
rappers used to favor. Despite the elaborate styling, Bernham thought he
could make out the word: SCIENCE. Most of these Lilywhites were gangster
wannabes with street names.

Bernham loosed the Velcro fastener.  A
dog-eared condom packet fell to the ground.  He thumbed through the contents:
welfare debit, probably stolen, belonging to some old man that looked
like a drugged out vampire, phone card, some kind of Captain Mirror
trading card, and, in the last sleeve, one of Copeland's ragged business cards.  Below Copeland's
contact information was written in red ink Bernham's name and cell
number.

From his heavy build, Bernham surmised that the boy being cuffed had
been guarding the door. Two more patrol cars rolled up the narrow
street, slowing to a stop.  The clusterfuck was starting, as it always
did.  "Tape this area off, I don't want anyone disturbing this scene,"
Bernham said, the detective in him surfacing reflexively. "Get this kid
down to processing. And get an ME out here."  The officer led the kid
off the porch, sizing Bernham up, Bernham's reputation preceding him.

"I thought you got re-assigned, Bernham."

"Hey, first detective on the scene is all." He shot the officer a cold
glare.  Even as dispatch he outranked this asshole.

Bernham banged on the door. "Police! We're coming in!" 

The remaining officer stood behind him. A strangely calm Asian kid came
to the door. He was on a cell phone. He held it away from his cheek,
addressing Bernham. "Not without a warrant you're not. That shit
happened outside."

"Bullshit. The kid that just got cuffed was your muscle on the door."

"You can talk to my lawyer. He's on the way down here. Otherwise, wait
for a warrant." The kid didn't rattle. He was all entitlement and
smoothness.

Bernham forced the door as the kid tried to hold it shut. He looked at
his backup, who held up his hands in an 'I'll have no part of this'
gesture. "Keep the crime scene clear, then," Bernham said, futilely.
Bernham clicked his tongue in disgust.  

Shoving his way in, the kid got close to Bernham, putting a finger in
his face. "I'm going to have your fucking badge for this, asshole. You
don't know who you're fucking with!" Bernham allowed himself a smirk,
happy with how little it took to break the kid's smug façade.

Bernham shouldered past the snot, careful to keep his hands at his side.
He had no desire to draw assault charges, though he knew it was probably
too late for that.

"Where is it?" Bernham moved through the house, tossing it for he didn't
know what.  In the living room he knocked over a bong, spilling the
pungent water on a stack of Economist magazines. He saw nothing out of
the ordinary. On the floor, there was a tangle of controller cords and a
game console that was cabled to a state of the art plasma big screen on
the wall. Bernham thought of the old 27-inch in his shit-hole apartment.


The kitchen had pop tarts, expired milk, standard grad school squalor,
by Bernham's estimate.  Nothing notable in the cabinets above the sink,
Bernham turned to the cabinets above the counter top, next to the
doorway to the living room. Before he searched the cabinets, he turned
to face the door opposite the end of the counter top, the entrance to
the basement, but made, for some reason, of stainless steel. On the door
a sign hung, affixed by masking tape: "Do not disturb-Revolutionizing
Humanity". Below the words was a cleanly stenciled version of the
classic Che Guevara image, eyes replaced by rainbowed Apples.  A keycard
slot was affixed to the door.  The Asian kid, following Bernham, stopped
in his tracks when he saw him, Bernham, looking at the door. Medical in
its sterility, the door was the elephant in this otherwise very domestic
room. Bernham tried to cool the situation, "Where's the card?" He asked
in a level, reasoned tone. "There's a dead kid in your front yard and
things are pretty fucked. Do yourself a favor, here."

Like a scolded child, the Asian kid stared at the floor, resignedly.
Caught, or just contemplating, Bernham wondered.  As the kid reached
into the cabinet, Bernham saw a keycard dangling from a plastic coil
bracelet on his wrist, like the cord on a telephone when they had cords.
He was a few seconds late in realizing that, with the keycard on his
wrist, the kid was reaching for something else.  "Freeze," Bernham cried
out. 

When he saw the gun, he stepped in, reflexively, getting too close for
the kid to get a shot off. He grabbed the arm that held the gun,
spinning the kid, so the snot's back was to the counter. He slammed the
gun hand into the cabinet door, repeating the blow as the kid struggled
against his grip. He had more fight in him than Bernham would have
guessed. He slammed one last time and the kid pulled the trigger,
accidentally. He startled himself and dropped the gun.  Breathing hard,
the kid stopped, shocked. Releasing the kid's wrists, they paused a
moment and looked at the hole in the wall. "That was fucking stupid,"
Bernham said.  He slugged the kid hard in the cheek. He crumbled beneath
Bernham's fist. The phone cord keychain stretched as he removed it from
the kid's wrist. He slotted and slid the card.

<p class=drop>In the basement, the air was cooler, noticeably fresher.  It smelled
hospital clean. He was somehow comforted by the white noise hum of air
conditioning.   It was dark, save for a workstation in the corner that
was lit by a hanging fluorescent unit.  Darwin lay on a cot. He wore his
expensive suit pants and a white undershirt, no shoes or socks. He wore
goggles, but no gloves. With tubes in his nose, an IV in his arm, he
appeared unconscious.  At the edge of the light cast by the fluorescent
was a kid seated at a desk set.  Goggled and gloved, he also wore
earbuds. His obliviousness was complete, as he massaged the air, his
fingertips casting strange diagrams into the air. The tip of the kid's
tongue protruded from his mouth, as Bernham approached. His gun was
drawn, partly for effect, but mostly because Bernham had no idea what
the fuck he was looking at and drawing the gun was his first
reaction. Bernham noticed his own sobriety, and wished for a drink. He kept
the gun trained on the kid, reaching out with his free hand to pluck the
bud from his ear.  The kid gasped. He ripped the goggles from his head,
disconnecting the G/G unit. The goggles clattered to the floor. He
looked at the Bernham, the gun pointed at his head. "The fuck is this,"
the kid yelped, startled.

"Police," Bernham said. He felt sweat on his brow despite the cool temp.
"What's wrong with Darwin?"

"Who are you? Where's Alan?"

"I'm Detective Bernham. If Alan is your Asian friend, I knocked him out
for being stupid. Don't make the same mistake. The fuck is all this?"

The kid reached down for the G/G cord, feeling for it, while keeping his
eyes on Bernham. He found the cord, plugged it in without looking. It
only took him two tries.

"Darwin's," he struggled for the word, "Darwin's downloading."

"Is he dead?"

"In a way. Almost.  He was dying of cancer."

"And now?"

"Well...if it works...parts of him, the most important parts, will
outlive his body." The kid put the gloves back on. This is a critical
part of the operation, though, because he is near brain death. 

"This isn't legal."

"There's no law against it. It's never been done. Mr. Darwin signed
releases," the kid said.

From upstairs, Bernham heard heavy footsteps. The kid looked up at the
ceiling. "What's that," the kid asked.

"More officers, is my bet," Bernham said.  The kid punched a key on his
keyboard, replacing the various graphs with surveillance views of the
tiny house. He could see two officers, one that was there when Bernham
arrived. There was also a man in an expensive looking suit. He appeared
to be losing his mind on the officers. 

"That's our lawyer. Why is he here? Why are you here?"

"I think because of the fucking murder on your front step."

He raised his eyebrows in some facsimile of concern. "I've been goggled
for the last few days, getting ready. I must not have heard anything." 

"We'll need to take you to the station to get your statement."

"They still do that?"

"They do it for the big stuff, yeah." Everything else has been
contracted and outsourced, though, Bernham thought. He grimaced at the
thought of the dead boy upstairs. He felt as though the tools that he had grown
to carry into the world were no longer any use.  The pieces he held
would not fit into any existing puzzle. In this, he felt utterly alone.

"I still have some more work to do here," the kid said as if to end the
exchange. He rolled his Aeron over to Darwin's cot, checking an IV drip,
placing two fingers on Darwin's neck, timing the pulse against his
watch. On the kid's monitor, Bernham could see the lawyer crouched next
to Alan. The lawyer helped Alan to his feet. He watched the expression
of horror creep across their faces as Alan explained what happened, like
some silent horror film. Bernham's time was up.  He watched the lawyer
bang on the door. Hearing it, it did not sync up with the surveillance
display.

Let's go, I said," Bernham said. "If the M.E. can't revive him I'm
charging you with this one, too." He cuffed the kid, unplugging his
gloves, yet again.  "I wouldn't worry, that lawyer wears his suit like a
real pro." This one kept his cool. He knew that Bernham would have no
leg to stand on, here, especially when the paperwork was produced.  If
his experiment failed as a result of Bernham's intervention, this kid
would start again, Bernham knew, using the knowledge gained to
streamline the process.  Unlike Bernham, these kids could roll with the
punches. For all their sense of entitlement, he knew this ability to
compromise, to take something away from failure, is what allowed them to
thrive.  Politics or no, Bernham knew this arrest would be his last.
Sadder still, he knew that any charges brought against these arrogant
young minds would not stick.  And still, he had no answers.  "We're
coming up," Bernham said. He was unsure whether he could be heard above
the banging on the door.

As he opened the door, he knew that he could not let things end in such
a pitiful way. If this was the end of his career, he wanted it to be
definitive and not some minor shit storm, for which he could just be
shuffled and reassigned.  To be paying such a price, he wanted
resolution.

He plucked the key card clipped to the kid's belt. He shoved the kid
hard, sending him crashing into the waiting entourage. It was enough time 
to slam the door shut again, locking them out of the basement, and 
locking himself in. He now had two key cards. It was a
long shot to bet that these were the only two. He didn't have long, in
any case.

Darwin was still. The monitors had gone all but silent. His heartbeat
was so infrequent that it deafened when marked by the machines.  Bernham
pulled off Darwin's goggles.  Bernham touched Darwin's eyelids, his
greasy skin. This face, in these last months, had become the avatar for
Bernham's pain. Bernham laid his hand across Darwin's throat, wondering
if it would be of any consequence to kill a man so close to death.  He
wondered whether Darwin had been anything more than a placeholder for
Bernham's guilt. Hating Darwin, wishing for one more shot at him, was
Bernham's defense against bearing the entire weight of his failure to
bring him to justice.

He wandered over to the desk set. The surveillance showed them banging
away on the door. He switched back to the bio-feedback monitor.  For the
first time, he goggled and gloved.  Through the view of the goggles,
everything looked remarkably similar, though somehow more vivid and
crisp, glowing at the edges.  He saw Darwin, still on the cot, still in
his suit pants. From his form, there streamed an elaborate set of
numbers and symbols. They shot like a beam into the infinity of what
Bernham assumed was IInternet, where he would live on in some new,
strange way. The symbols, slowing in their emanation, dwindled to
nothing and the stream ended.  Darwin's glow ceased and he went gray,
like an unlit bulb. Outside of this space and outside of himself,
Bernham heard the banging on the door. It would not stand much more of
that banging. The last of Darwin's data shot like a spear into the
horizon and Bernham knew that he would never catch up.

[*BLURB] Short, but beautifully formed, this story about an arms race
from Ambrose Bierce. Bierce was a prolific, if rather cynical, storyteller.
One of my favourite books is his <I>The Devil's Dictionary</i>. He 
disappeared in Mexico at the age of 71.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>Having obtained an audience of the King, an Ingenious Patriot pulled a
paper from his pocket, saying:

"May it please your Majesty, I have here a formula for constructing
armour-plating which no gun can pierce.  If these plates are adopted in
the Royal Navy our warships will be invulnerable, and therefore
invincible.  Here, also, are reports of your Majesty's Ministers,
attesting the value of the invention.  I will part with my right in it
for a million tumtums."

After examining the papers, the King put them away and promised him an
order on the Lord High Treasurer of the Extortion Department for a
million tumtums.

"And here," said the Ingenious Patriot, pulling another paper from
another pocket, "are the working plans of a gun that I have invented,
which will pierce that armour.  Your Majesty's Royal Brother, the Emperor
of Bang, is anxious to purchase it, but loyalty to your Majesty's throne
and person constrains me to offer it first to your Majesty.  The price is
one million tumtums."

Having received the promise of another check, he thrust his hand into
still another pocket, remarking:

"The price of the irresistible gun would have been much greater, your
Majesty, but for the fact that its missiles can be so effectively averted
by my peculiar method of treating the armour plates with a new--"

The King signed to the Great Head Factotum to approach.

"Search this man," he said, "and report how many pockets he has."

"Forty-three, Sire," said the Great Head Factotum, completing the
scrutiny.

"May it please your Majesty," cried the Ingenious Patriot, in terror,
"one of them contains tobacco."

"Hold him up by the ankles and shake him," said the King; "then give him
a check for forty-two million tumtums and put him to death.  Let a decree
issue declaring ingenuity a capital offence."

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Anxious readers will have observed that this edition of
Mythaxis is at least one month, perhaps two months, late.

It is, however, well worth the wait, in my opinion, especially since we
have made important changes to the website, both here, in the magazine,
and in the forum, which has been rebuilt using a different mechanism.

<p class=drop>The forum is still a lonely place, due to the fact that, when I last encouraged
people to join in, the forum was ignoring sign-up requests. Give it
another try, and if it fails again, run screaming to me and I'll make it all right.

<p class=drop>Over the course of my travels around the web, I have discovered quite a lot of
free-to-download sf, some of it, I'm afraid, extremely dire or old or both, but much of
a high quality. Although I feel that online reading is best served by <b>short</b> stories, there
are quite a few modern sf novels available for download. In the last
couple of years, I have read <ul><li> Charles Stross's
<I>Accelerando</I>;<Li>Cory Doctorow's <I>Down and Out in the Magic
Kingdom</i>;<li>Rudy Rucker's <I>Postsingular</i></ul> Links to all of
