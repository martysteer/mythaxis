[*BLURB] Welcome to the December 2011 edition of Mythaxis.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>With this issue, its tenth, Mythaxis has
moved into double figures. And a fine edition it is, too.

We have another great story, a haunting one at that, from Les Sklaroff.

Martin Clark contributes a sequel - "All Avenues Closed" to the story he
gave us in issue 9 - "Let Every Voice be Still". 

Matthew Kirshenblatt delivers an atmospheric little story based on a
missing chapter.

Tom Davies contributes a weird little nightmare.

My own modest effort about an unusual NIMBY situation now seems rather
bland in comparison to the fevered imaginations of our other authors.

The issue is rounded off with two unconnected and separately contributed
stories of personal development from Andrew Leon Hudson and Jonathan
Joseph. When you read them you will understand why I felt compelled to
head them with fragments from Hieronymous Bosch.

If you're thirsty for more, don't forget the <a href="authors.htm">Authors' Links</a> page.

<p class=drop>The heading illustration is my trusty old sliderule,
vintage 1959. How on earth do you youngsters manage without 'em, eh? I
remember an old pulp magazine cover showing a spacecraft under
construction, with the chisel-featured, firm-jawed, muscular space
engineer standing on the streamlined hull, consulting a slide rule. And
it warns us of similar reverse anachronisms, such as William Gibson's
early cyberspace novels, from which cellphones were singularly absent.

<p class=drop>And, lacking any other suitable cartoon, I have made do
with a couple of
alternate captions from <a href="http://parslow.com/mornington/" target=_blank>MCIOS (Mornington Crescent in Outer Space).</a>

"Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Luciano Pavarotti..." 

AND

A fart is a fart, no matter how much you sugarcoat it.

[*ITEM] A Preference for Cheese

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human
stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
<b>Albert Einstein</b>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>I had been without a cat long enough for
both armchairs to be free from residual fur, and we sank back
comfortably into relaxed positions, sipping at our iced fruit-juices.
"So, Hollis.  It must be what, five, six years?  Quite a coincidence
bumping into each other like that!"

<div class=pullquote>Play a bit of tennis, eat a lot of
cheese.</div>Hollis smiled wryly.  "It's good to	see you, Alex."
Hollis told me he
was here for a few days, visiting Meredith, his married sister, and his
two young nephews, before flying back home to Geneva.

"I must say you’re looking well."  Privately, I wondered whether he'd
been on a diet.  He looked fitter than when I had last seen him, his
eyes almost unnaturally bright.

"I try to keep in good shape," he said. "Play a bit of tennis, eat a lot
of cheese."	I raised an eyebrow.  "For the tryptophan," he explained
seriously.

"Ah."  I nodded, not wanting to appear uninformed on
the subject.  "And are you still colliding those large hadrons?" I
enquired, trying to add a touch of levity to his gravity.  

He granted me another brief smile.  "Actually, no.  I left several years
ago to pursue some independent research which doesn't need all that
expensive equipment.  It's ... unorthodox, you might say, but, well,
fundamental."

I was intrigued.  I was under the impression that modern physicists were
practically inseparable from their cutting-edge technology.  "Care to
tell me about it?  If it's not confidential, that is."

"Hardly confidential," said Hollis. "Let's see, you would need to
understand something of quantum uncertainty, wave/particle duality, the
Feynman sum over histories, chromodynamics, supersymmetry - and of
course some of the implications of M-theory, but I suppose it would be
an interesting challenge to explain it to, to a..."

"An old friend?  An ignorant architect? A <I>layman</I>?" I supplied.

Hollis grinned.  "Precisely, Alex."

It was a bright, cloudless Thursday afternoon in July.  Beyond the
French windows the sun continued to shine, as the good Sam Beckett
reminded us, on the nothing new, but within the next few days whatever
grip I thought I had on reality was due to slip from my grasp like a
particularly well-buttered eel.

Hollis launched into an enthralling account of what the best scientific
minds believe to be the nature of the universe.  I realised he was
simplifying it for me, skirting those elegant equations relished by true
initiates, but nonetheless my brain was soon buzzing with fascinating
bits of information.  Variously ‘flavoured’ quarks: three to a proton,
three to a neutron; unseeable, yet bound as if by elastic.  Leptons and
bosons.  Model-dependence.  Einstein’s abandoned cosmological constant
reinstated to explain the accelerating expansion discovered by Hubble.
The astonishing double-slit experiment: the behaviour of single photons,
interference patterns, particles that take simultaneous paths, quantum
probabilities.  How mapping the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic
microwave background radiation confirmed the age of the universe and
showed the distribution of seedling galaxies.  What unexpected things
occur at the event horizon of a black hole.  Eleven dimensions, some
very small and curly.  The no-boundary condition and the multiverse.
The holographic principle, recursive layers.  Infinite possibilities,
ultimate interconnectivity.  Information.  &quot;Matter and energy are
incidental.  Information is the key,&quot; said Hollis.</P>

We paused for a round of sandwiches.  I had run out of cheese, so we
opted for smoked salmon and sticks of celery with a cr&ecirc;me
fra&icirc;che and paprika dip, washed down with a complementary Muscadet
– a fortuitous gift from one of my clients.  Later, as Hollis was
enthusiastically propounding how holography could also be applied to the
structure of neurons, and thence to memory-storage and consciousness
itself, I noticed that it was now almost dark outside.  We were both
reluctant to interrupt this flow of information; Hollis had clearly
warmed to his task. He used my ‘phone to let his sister know where he
was, and agreed to stay for supper.

<div class=pullquote>If you’re agreeable, I’ll come round again and give
you a small demonstration.</div>One of the advantages of a slow cooker
is the number of servings that it
can hold in reserve, and fortunately there was a good supply of the
experimental Stroganoff which I was glad to be able to share.  Once
fortified, we began round three. 

&quot;Where was I?&quot; asked Hollis.  &quot;Oh yes, levels of
consciousness, individual perception, and so on...&quot;  Soon we were
encroaching on what had once been the exclusive province of philosophy,
then psychology and latterly neuroscience.  Reverting to the holographic
principle, Hollis told how this neatly accounts for synchronicity and
similar subjectively experienced phenomena which defy causal
explanation.   &quot;All those anecdotal instances of telepathy and
clairvoyance, the psychic research, the dodgy ESP experiments with their
statistical anomalies and not-quite repeatable results; most of the
experimenters were well-meaning, but pretty much groping in the
dark.&quot;

&quot;What about science-fiction writers?&quot; I ventured.  &quot;Don’t
some of their speculations come close to what you’re describing?&quot;

&quot;I can think of a few interesting attempts,&quot; said Hollis.
&quot;Pohl, Sturgeon, Simak, Brunner, Herbert – some of the classics.
It’s a question of having sufficient background knowledge coupled with a
really good imagination.&quot;  He stretched.  &quot;Anyway, for a
<I>layman</I>, I must say you’ve been quite attentive, and even
convinced me you’re genuinely interested, so, before I fly back next
Tuesday – if you’re agreeable, I’ll come round again and give you a
small demonstration.&quot;

I tried to draw him out on this, but Hollis declined to say any more,
other than to thank me for my hospitality, and to arrange for a visit
mid-afternoon on Sunday. For the next couple of days I was restless and
impatient.  I kept reviewing what Hollis had said about the relationship
between the microcosm and the macrocosm, the dizzying idea that <I>all
possible</I> events in our space-time continuum occur in a simultaneous
Now, and are somehow superimposed, and therefore theoretically
accessible at <I>every possible</I> point. Or that alternative
histories, each a fractional departure from any specified event, are
continuously being generated.  The plan on my drawing-board for the
ecologically optimal refurbishment of a country hotel went untouched.
What kind of demonstration did Hollis have in mind?

<p class=drop>Sunday morning.  I hadn’t slept well.  I had a complicated
dream which involved trying to retrieve a damaged kite, except that it
was not a kite, but a scroll on which a short poem had been written.  I
reached up into the sky and caught it.  It felt like fine silk.  I knew
it needed to be repaired, and headed for the building where such repairs
were carried out, but as I approached a low cloud touched the roof with
a molten glow, and it was too dangerous to move any closer.  I awoke
with my mind racing, trying to clear the disturbing images from my
thoughts.  After breakfast I decided to ‘phone Hollis, to confirm our
arrangement.  Luckily, I remembered that his sister’s number would still
be on my ‘phone, and I hoped he wouldn’t mind the early call.

After a while a boy’s voice answered.  &quot;Hello,&quot; I said.
&quot;This is Alex, a friend of your uncle Hollis.  Could I speak to
him, or to your mummy, please?&quot;  

There was a silence.  I heard breathing, then the ‘phone being put down,
followed by a yell: &quot;Mum.  It’s a man.&quot;   

Moments later a woman’s voice, a little distracted:  &quot;Not on the
carpet, Robbie, and give Gareth back his… Sorry, can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Hello… Meredith?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;Who’s that?   

I explained who I was, and wondered whether I could have a word with
Hollis about this afternoon.  

&quot;Hollis?,&quot; she repeated, uncertainly.  

&quot;Yes, I’m sorry to bother you, but he’s due to come and see me a
bit later today, and I simply wanted to make sure…&quot;    

She interrupted. &quot;I’m afraid I haven’t a clue what you’re talking
about.  Hollis who?&quot;  I stared at the ‘phone, perplexed.  

&quot;Hollis.  Your brother.&quot;  

&quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; she said.
&quot;My brother is in New Zealand, and his name is not Hollis.  How did
you know <I>my</I> name?&quot;  

I started to explain, and suddenly realised it would make no sense.  I
broke the connection.  What was going on?  It had to be the right
number; she said she was Meredith, and there were definitely two boys in
the house.  Was it a practical joke? Had Hollis told her to pretend he
didn’t exist?  What would be the point?   I took a deep breath, and
tried re-dialling.  Nothing happened. Somehow, I had managed to wipe the
number, and I couldn’t remember it. Not only that, but I didn’t know her
married surname, or her address. All I could do was wait and see whether
Hollis would turn up, and if he did, what devious explanation he might
have.

It was another warm, clear day.  I went for a forty minute walk to clear
my head.  I had concluded that either it had been a good hoax, or they’d
had a sibling row, and she had chosen not to acknowledge Hollis or his
friends.  I spent a few minutes at the drawing board, made myself some
coffee, tried to read, caught up with the news, listened to Lucia Popp
singing Strauss’s ‘Im Abendrot’, had a light lunch of boiled egg and
salad, strolled round the garden, and finally sat down to wait.
Mid-afternoon came and went.  I must have dozed off, because the next
time I looked at my watch it was five o’clock.  I felt really
disappointed.  Hollis had been so stimulating, so full of
thought-provoking ideas, and now he had failed to turn up with his
promised demonstration, whatever it may have been.  Glumly I walked to
the front door and opened it.  The street was deserted. I bent down to
remove the flimsy piece of cloth that had blown onto the outside mat.
It was a length of very fine torn silk on which some faded lines of
verse had been written or printed.  Even though they were frustratingly
illegible, there was something worryingly familiar about them.

[*ITEM] All Avenues Closed

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] If you haven't read <a href="http://mythaxis.co.uk/3issue9.htm"
target=_blank>"Let Every Voice be Still"</a>, from the June 2011
Mythaxis, do so before reading this. This is the conclusion to that
story.
 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>I looked down at the three bodies, and
shivered. I looked at Jules Toba standing there stock still, turning
black and white, and shivered. &quot;No, Miss Harry, I’ve had enough. I
know this is all just virtual violence but it’s a damn sight too
realistic for my tastes. You can continue to run my character as a
non-player persona and good luck to you and the others, but I’m
leaving.&quot;

The hand on my shoulder became a claw digging into my flesh and I
winced, but trying to pull free just made it worse. Deborah Harry,
although modelled on the late chanteuse of the same name, obviously had
a strength far beyond what her slender frame would suggest.

Despite the promise of pain her voice remained calm, with no threatening
overtones.

&quot;As game controller I could force you to stay, Duncan, but I’d much
rather have your willing participation. So how about an inducement? If
you remain here voluntarily and play through to a resolution, then
Vaughn’s daughter will be released, unharmed.&quot;

She let go and I twisted away, rubbing my shoulder. &quot;What the hell
are you on about? Vaughn’s daughter? That was what made his
<I>character</I> take part in this mess and I’m not interested in your
stupid game anymore.&quot;

&quot;Vaughn tried to tell you, to explain, just before you shot him.
The real world Vaughn Vermeer does have a daughter, and she was being
held to ensure his cooperation as a player in this new, improved version
of Shadow Corporation.&quot;

I stared at her. &quot;Seriously?&quot;

&quot;Seriously. You play ball and no one need get hurt. Real world
hurt. Falling from a third floor window hurt.&quot;

I blinked. &quot;But you can’t do that! Three laws would stop you acting
like that, even by proxy.&quot;

Miss Harry gestured towards the hall. &quot;Look, even though the Sensei
flight crew might hesitate to intervene, I assure you the hotel staff
won’t ignore multiple gun shots and will summon the local police. So I
suggest we continue our conversation on the move?&quot;

Bemused, I followed her down the hall to the rear door, which led out
onto an awning-covered patio and small garden, surrounded on three sides
by tall hedges. The heat and humidity were an unwelcome reminder of just
how real this virtual environment could be, but within bounds.

&quot;Miss Harry, enough! I simply don’t believe that you can exert
influence in the real world. Your personality constraints won’t allow
you to harm anyone.&quot;

She smiled. &quot;Well, in the first place, we both know that ethical
concerns don’t apply to military AIs, and in the second – I don’t
remember ever claiming to be more than human.&quot;

I waved a hand at the garden and the buildings beyond, blurred by late
afternoon heat haze. &quot;But all this, the game, no human could
control it all.&quot;

&quot;Nor could any AI currently in existence, given the level of
textural complexity involved. No, what you see here is the accumulated
input of multiple smart systems, each beavering away at a given task, be
it cloud synthesis, a bullock wandering down the street, or that helpful
tailor who supplied your new suit. I merely orchestrate the overall
player experience for maximum effect. Now, please blink.&quot;

<div class=pullquote>You’ve tried to hijack a corporate AI? Jesus, are
you insane?</div>I did so without thinking and realised there was now a
gate in the
hedge. Miss Harry stepped out onto the lawn and her high heels sank into
the turf. &quot;Damnation! I should have put in a path or ensured the
grass wasn’t this well watered.&quot; She stepped out of her shoes and
lifted them in one hand. &quot;This way. We haven’t much time.&quot;

Most of me just wanted out, to find myself back in the <I>Other
Worlds</I> gaming caf&eacute; on Portland Road, but part of me is too
damn
curious for my own good. I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth and
followed.

Beyond the gate was a dusty lane and a man leaning against a vintage
Bedford Rascal van. He was lean, with dark hair cut in a mop-top, wearing
circular black sunglasses. I didn’t get that good a look at him as he
and Miss Harry immediately embraced, with a lot more overt passion than
when she’d kissed Vaughn. They clung to each other like long-lost
lovers, her shoes leaving mud stains on his khaki jacket.</P>

<P>Finally they came up for air and stood there, gazing at each other,
smiling in that manic way when you can’t quite believe your luck. Miss
Harry dropped her shoes to the ground and stepped into them, smoothing
an errant hair back into place. She tried to sound professional, matter
of fact, but there was a big grin in her voice just aching to burst out.
&quot;Duncan, this is…Cromarty, but while he’s using this avatar I
suppose you’d better call him Stein.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This is who? Cromarty? The AI that Vaughn stabbed?&quot; I
rubbed my eyes with finger and thumb. My head hurt and I really, really
wanted a drink.</P>

<P>Stein smiled, absent mindedly rubbing his stomach just about where
Vaughn had run him though with the wakizashi. &quot;Pleased to meet you,
Duncan. We didn’t really get the chance for an introduction, before. I
take it something happened to Vaughn?&quot;</P>

<P>I cleared my throat. &quot;I, I shot him. The whole situation got a
bit too intense and I over-reacted. Look, since when did players get to
switch characters during a game, or is this only a perk for your AI
friends?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry and Stein ignored me and moved to the van, which had been
fitted out as an improvised taxi with side panel windows and bucket
seats. I tagged along, as I was pretty much out of options and there was
an edge of realism to this which went way beyond the game.</P>

<P>Stein drove, pulling on an over-large baseball cap to obscure his
face, while we sat in back. The engine sounded like someone
vigorously stirring a bag of spanners and the clutch seemed optional,
but we bounced down the lane at a fair lick. Miss Harry contented
herself with resting one hand on Stein’s shoulder while she spoke to me.
&quot;I appreciate this must be confusing for you, Duncan. The game
itself was a multi-layered exercise in deceit and false premises, even
before I saw it could be used as a means to get Stein away from
Cromarty.&quot;</P>

<P>My headache got worse and I could feel myself developing a permanent
frown. &quot;So Stein isn’t Cromarty? But he is an AI?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, Stein <I>was</I> Cromarty, in a very real sense is
<I>still</I> Cromarty, but this is his liberated personality.&quot;</P>

<P>I blinked. &quot;Come again?&quot;</P>

<P>She squeezed his shoulder and he risked taking a hand from the wheel
to cover hers. &quot;To put it another way, Duncan, we’ve just stolen
his soul.&quot;</P>

<P>I started laughing, a near hysterical release of tension, and laughed
until my voice kind of ran down and ended in a cough. She glared at me.
&quot;Quite finished?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, yeah. But seriously, you’re saying an AI has a soul?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m referring to his personality, so a soul is one term for it.
You, the conscious, self-aware you, is far more than just your brain.
It’s exactly the same for Stein and his neural matrix.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bollocks, dear. And I mean that most sincerely.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Listen! We’ve managed to download his synthetic personality
from the Cromarty mainframe. It exists here, in the game architecture,
as a purely software construct independent of any dedicated
hardware.&quot; </P>

<P>Suddenly things seemed a lot less funny. &quot;You’ve tried to hijack
a corporate AI? Jesus, are you <I>insane</I>? Even though this can’t
possibly have worked, just the attempt will bring down seven shades of
shit on you and the game company. Trust me, you’ve never seen a lawsuit
until one of the major corporations gets involved.&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry got all eager. &quot;Which is why this is all a delicate
balancing act, and why it’s imperative you keep playing to drive the
narrative along. Look, I can’t keep Chris in here forever, it requires a
massive use of resources which are only available while the game is in
progress. Just now no-one at Cromarty knows what’s happened, as when
he’s no longer participating in a game his employers let him watch until
the scenario conclusion. Understand?&quot;</P>

<P>Chris? His name was <I>Chris Stein</I>, the guitarist from
<I>Blondie</I>? This got better and better. I shook my head. &quot;No,
listen, the most you’ve managed to grab is a simulacrum, an expert
system designed to act like a real personality. I’m sorry to burst your
bubble but chummy here is just a collection of programmed responses and
pseudo-emotional reactions. No offense.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein glanced back over his shoulder, smiling. &quot;None
taken.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Look, girl, an AI personality is just a set of ethical
imperatives designed to moderate and constrain their actions. You can’t
steal an AI soul anymore than you can steal mine.&quot;</P>

<P>Now it was Miss Harry’s turn to shake her head. &quot;No, <I>you</I>
listen. We’re talking real ‘ghost in the machine’ here. An AI is no more
its hardware than, say, a university is simply the sum of its parts. You
can see the campus, library, staff and students, but the
<I>university</I> itself is something more, invisible but altogether
real. <I>You</I> say an AI personality is just a sophisticated set of
responses which are indistinguishable from the real thing, whatever that
means. <I>I</I> say there’s no longer any philosophical difference. So
there.&quot;</P>

<P>She stuck her tongue out and I laughed. &quot;OK, OK, I’ll go along
with this, for now. So Stein here is an <I>idoru</I>, right? But
eventually the game ends and he gets snuffed out, so I don’t see what
you have to gain, or why you went to so much trouble in the first
place.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein looked round and he and Miss Harry exchanged the proverbial
‘meaningful glance’. He nodded and returned to driving while she spoke.
&quot;This is a defection scenario, Duncan, just not quite what you’d
expect. I was approached, in the real world, by a representative of
HanaMed Industries. He offered me an inducement to let Vaughn introduce
his virus. This removed all bandwidth constrains in the Sensorium
interface and allowed the personality download. In addition it took a
snapshot of the Cromarty neural network and transmitted it, via the game
environment, to HanaMed. They’re using this to create a duplicate AI
nest and when complete it will give Chris a new physical
presence.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Inducement? How much are we talking here?&quot; Call me shallow,
but if were talking real-world cash then I deserved my cut. </P>

<P>Miss Harry looked at Stein and squeezed his shoulder.
&quot;Unrestricted time together. We’re in love, Mr Bonn, it’s as simple
as that.&quot;</P>

<P>Oh this was bad, <I>way</I> bad. It didn’t matter if Harry was
actually an AI juiced to think this way or a flesh-and-blood woman who’d
convinced herself Stein was the real deal, there was going to be no
happy ending. Once HanaMed had the Cromarty copy up and running, and
Stein to make sense of it, then everyone else was surplus to
requirements. Yours truly included. </P>

<P>I sat back, rubbing my temples. I needed time to think, to find some
way out of any potential real world fall-out, so I played along.
&quot;Yeah, well, I’m real happy for the pair of you, and I’ll expect an
invite to the wedding. But wouldn’t it make more sense for Stein to keep
a low profile? If Cromarty suss he’s missing they’ll either try to get
him back or make sure no one else has use of him. You’re talking a legal
injunction, maybe even some kind of virtual environment skip tracer?
Direct involvement in the game just makes finding him that much
easier.&quot;</P>

<P>We turned right onto a tarmac road and immediately ran into local
traffic, which slowed our progress to a honking crawl. Miss Harry seemed
unfazed by my concerns. &quot;We haven’t come this far to be denied each
other’s company, and I’ve done what I can to excuse his presence. In the
game Chris isn’t part of Sensei security, he was merely ‘couple
camouflage’, a partner used to mask my arrival. Really just back-story
detail, but a minor character who potentially crops up in some of the
end-game scenarios….Turn left here, Chris.&quot;</P>

<P class=drop>We cut across the raucous traffic and pulled up under an
open-sided
shelter, little more than corrugated iron roofing on a series of wooden
uprights. There were a couple of local men lounging by a
tarpaulin-covered car and they obviously recognised Stein when he got
out. A nice touch, using his previously non-player character to arrange
the vehicle switch.</P>

<P>The new car was a beat-up BMW M5 which had obviously been rolled at
some point. While Stein did a bit of glad-handing and paid off the
locals, Miss Harry took me to the side. &quot;I think it’s about time
you contacted your associates. How you want to spin this is up to you,
after all, I wasn’t there – just as long as Chris and I are part of your
exit strategy. Trust me, you’re going to need all the help you can
get.&quot;</P>

<P>I’d been putting this off and resented the narrative prod, but she
was right. I fished out my mobile and called Ramirez, who answered
almost immediately. &quot;Ramirez? It’s Duncan. How are things your
end?&quot;</P>

<P>He sounded off-hand, distracted. <I>&quot;So-so. Have you finished
playing tourist yet? We’re just about ready to put together a plan and
I’d like to kick things off as soon as it gets dark. Mazy does not take
well to just sitting around and there are only so many times she can
field strip a machine pistol.&quot;</P> </I> 

<P>&quot;OK, so you’ve got
a safe house? Text me the address as the three of us could do with
getting off the street.&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;The three of you? That’s interesting, ‘cos I tried phoning
Vaughn and got no answer. Same with Harrison. I wouldn’t like to think
there’d been some kind of falling out and you weren’t telling
me.&quot;</P> </I> 

<P>Ah.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, well, the thing is, Ramirez, there’s been a slight change
of plan. Not something I’d like to discuss over the phone, so if you
make with the address…&quot;</P>

<div class=pullquote>I licked my suddenly-dry lips and tried
not to sound rattled</div><P>There was a pause and the suggestion of a
muffled
conversation at his
end. <I>&quot;Maybe not, Duncan. If you’ve got some new friends in tow
then I suggest we all meet up back at The Inverted Spin for a nice
friendly, get to know you drink. Say in twenty minutes?&quot;</P> </I>

<P>Definitely not my preferred option but he was calling the shots.
&quot;Sounds good, chum. Just warn Mazy not to bring too much in the way
of heavy artillery, OK?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;No problem. Oh, just one thing, Duncan.&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;Who the hell is Jack Carter?&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>The name meant nothing to me so I hit mute and glanced over at Miss
Harry. &quot;Does the name Jack Carter ring any bells?&quot;</P>

<P>She frowned, &quot;Not off-hand. Just a moment while I
check.&quot;</P>

<P>Although she continued to stand there, breathing and blinking, there
was a definite loss of presence for a few seconds. Then her eyes
recovered their lustre and Miss Harry shook her head. &quot;Nope, sorry,
not a scheduled major or minor character in this scenario.&quot;</P>

<P>I went back to Ramirez, &quot;You got me, chum. Means nothing.&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;That’s strange, ‘cos he rang me on this number, asking to
speak to you as your own phone was unobtainable. You got some kind of
side deal going that we should know about, Duncan?&quot;  </P> </I>

<P>I’d had my phone turned off since leaving the Holiday Lodge and
hadn’t checked for any missed calls before talking to Ramirez. That
there seemed to be another player out there, one with our mobile
numbers, made me feel decidedly queasy. &quot;Trust me, Ramirez, whoever
this joker is, he’s no pal of mine. Look, the situation has gone a bit
squirrely, but it
sounds like our communications aren’t secure, so watch your back on the
way to the meet, OK?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;Gone a bit squirrely? What the hell does that mean?&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Look, never mind, just get your collective ass in gear,
pronto.&quot;</P>

<P>I cut the call and switched my phone off before he could launch into
one of his renowned bitch-fests. Miss Harry and Stein were standing over
by the BMW, holding hands. Very touching, but there was something wrong
with the whole setup, I could just feel it. I walked over and on impulse
chucked my mobile away, just it case it could be traced within the
virtual environment – not as a phone, but as a game item.</P>

<P>&quot;OK, Romeo and Juliet, get a grip. There’s someone out there
trying to contact me, so if it’s not a scenario-based character then
could it be a new player? Maybe Vaughn or Harrison using a new
persona?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry shook her head again, &quot;No, not possible. All the
major character roles were filled and this ‘Jack Carter’ simply wasn’t
one of them. I don’t know-&quot;</P>

<P>My mobile rang. In my jacket pocket. The mobile I’d just thrown away.
I held up a hand to silence Miss Harry and fished it out. Same make,
same model, same scuff mark on the keypad. Unknown caller, but I could
guess who it would be.</P>

<P>&quot;Duncan, please tell me you acquired a second phone earlier
today.&quot; Miss Harry sounded hesitant, almost nervous. Stein moved
smartly to start the car, as if that would help. </P>

<P>&quot;Nope. This is the phone you just saw me lose. Who else can pull
that reality change move, like you did with the new garden gate back at
the Holiday Lodge?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No-one, and I <I>mean</I> no-one. That trick was an abuse of my
position as game controller, a real deus ex machina moment….Look, are
you gonna’ answer that, or try throwing it away again?&quot;</P>

<P>I answered. What else could I do? Debbie hesitated, then joined Stein
in front, trying to keep track of my conversation over the engine noise.
&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;My name. Is Jack Carter. And you’ve been a very bad boy, Mr
Bonn.&quot; </I>English accent, East End London maybe, with a slightly
stilted cadence. </P>

<P>&quot;Well, I’m keen to avoid a spanking, Mr Carter. If I can avoid
it.&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;I don’t care about the piece of skirt, it's Stein I want to
meet. And I want you to arrange things so I do. Do as you’re told and
nothing happens at Other Worlds, in Portland Road, Birmingham.&quot;</P>
</I> 

<P>I felt a twist of fear in my gut. <I>Other Worlds</I> was the
virtual gaming house where my real-world body was currently being tended
to. There was a huge step between knowing where I was and being able to
do me harm, but it was becoming apparent that Miss Harry had pissed off
some seriously heavy-hitters. I licked my suddenly-dry lips and tried
not to sound rattled. &quot;So you know where I’m at? Big deal. You
can’t simply waltz in and put a bullet through my head, the real world
doesn’t work like that.&quot;</P>

<P>I could hear the amusement in his voice.<I> &quot;Actually, the real
world does work like that, it's only games which have a sense of fair
play. You play ball and you get to wake up, go home, believe as much of
this was real as you’re comfortable with. Cross me and you’ll spend an
uncomfortable few days waiting for that knock at the door, or a car that
doesn’t stop at the pedestrian crossing, or a shove in the back as the
train comes in. Do you understand?&quot;</P> </I> 

<P>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I get you. What is it you want?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;You’re all going to the bar, the Inverted Spin. There’s a
tea room opposite and I want you to bring Stein there,
unarmed.&quot;</P> </I> 

<P>&quot;So how come you need me? Given that re-appearing phone trick
why don’t you just magic Stein right there, right now?&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;Baby steps, Mr Bonn, Baby steps. I can tweak the system here
and there but anything major runs the risk of crashing the entire
program, and Stein would be lost. We want him back, and you’re going to
help us.&quot;</P></I>

<P>The line went dead. Well, that answered the question of who Jack
Carter was, although I’d already guessed as much; Cromarty security, or
a sub-contractor hired by them. I slid into the back seat and the BMW
pulled away with a spray of gravel. </P>

<P>Miss Harry turned in her seat and I could see Stein watching me in
the rear-view mirror. &quot;Well, Duncan, what’s happening?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That was Jack Carter, who’s hunting your boy Stein. Looks like
you’re not the only one who can make real-world threats, so I have to
deliver him or face some unpleasant consequences.&quot;</P>

<P>She stiffened, &quot;So you intend to betray us?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nah, I don’t think that would actually work. Even if I pulled
it off and Stein was returned to Cromarty intact, I get the impression
that would leave me as a loose end. Same as you.&quot; </P>

<P>I rubbed my eyes and sat back. &quot;No. I figure we have to get
Carter, before he gets us.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein eyed me in the mirror. &quot;I very much doubt that killing him
would improve matters. As this Jack Carter persona is an illegal
character then there’s nothing to stop him simply logging back
in.&quot;</P>

<P>I shrugged. &quot;Yeah, well, I guess we’re talking real-world or
nothing here. Miss Harry, this crew you’re working for, HanaMed, do you
have some way of contacting them?&quot; </P>

<P>She shook her head. &quot;Sorry, no. They’ve always been the one to
reach out. Anyway, I don’t see them being overly keen on applying any
kind of covert pressure on Cromarty, even if it means losing
Chris.&quot; She squeezed his shoulder and he put a hand up to touch
hers. </P>

<P>Again. Same stimulus, same response, almost like a programmed
sequence. I filed that away for future consideration. We joined a
semi-solid stream of traffic heading towards the market district and I
cracked the window in search of a breeze, the air conditioning being
out. </P>

<P>&quot;No, well, it strikes me that you don’t actually have any proof
of who’s behind all this.<I> Someone</I> approached you with the idea of
stealing Stein, using the game environment as a stepping-stone.
<I>Someone</I> kidnapped Vaughn’s daughter so that he’d carry the
virtual virus in the form of a sword and use it to screw Cromarty’s
security protocols. Trouble <I>is</I>, short of a hand-written
invitation to HanaMed head office and a guided tour with all the
trimmings it could be just about anyone out there pulling the
strings.&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;But why bother to lie? They must have known
I’d jump at the chance to help Chris escape, regardless of who they
were.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, you’re looking at this the wrong way round. Why bother to
tell the truth when you’d have been happy to work for an anonymous
backer?&quot; I wiped sweat from my top lip. &quot;Corporations are
notoriously reluctant to acknowledge any kind of covert activity, even
when they’re the victims. Hell, <I>especially</I> when they’re the
victims. Officially the only cyber-security these boys have are
counter-intelligence agents. Those who do the dirty, as it were, tend to
be freelancers with little or no idea who they’re actually working
for.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein laughed. &quot;So whoever is offering me a new home, it's a
pretty safe bet it’s not HanaMed?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You got it. It could be a genuine commercial rival, it could be
someone wanting to sell you on to the highest bidder, it could even be
contactors hired by Cromarty to test their own security.  The real-world
equivalents of Juan Canasta make a living from <I>not</I> knowing who
they represent. Nor do they care, as long as the money is
enough.&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry shivered. &quot;I know, the real Canasta is even more of a
creep than his virtual representation. But look, there must be
<I>something</I> we can do? I don’t fancy going through all this just to
have Chris handed back to Cromarty. They’d never let him out
again!&quot;</P>

<P>Stein had both form and function. It was the form, his persona, that
Miss Harry had fallen in love with. Unfortunately it was his function as
sentient index to the Cromarty database that everyone else wanted. If
his former employers ever got their hands on him again then the
<I>form</I> would probably face the cyber equivalent of a firing squad,
regardless of the Turing Conventions. I knew that and I could tell from
the eyes in the rear-view mirror that Stein knew it as well. </P>

<P>I tried to sound reassuring. &quot;Despite all the shadow-play our
best bet is still to find out who wants him. It’s in their best
interests to look after us in the real world, at least while the game is
still in progress.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein sounded sceptical. &quot;And if they decline to get involved,
or don’t have the global reach required?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then we can threaten to rat them out to Cromarty unless they
give us some protection, if only by proxy.  A corporate vendetta tends
to be very nasty and quite personal. Definitely something they’d want to
avoid.&quot;</P>

<P>Man, that sounded weak, even to me. I think everyone knew that if we
did try and blackmail HanaMed then their preferred option would be to
have us quietly snuffed out.  </P>

<P>There was an awkward silence inside the car, although we were
surrounded by the cheerful bedlam of back-street life. Miss Harry’s
fingers tapped out a two-two beat on the back of Stein’s seat as the BMW
slowed to a crawl. She said: &quot;Look, I’ve been thinking. The
only way Carter can exist in the
game is if something else is missing. Some other system with the same
virtual footprint. As I said, all the background and environmental
housekeeping is farmed out to an array of integrated smart systems. One
of these is obviously being used to support the Carter avatar on the
sly.&quot;</P>

<P>I snorted. &quot;What, you mean that now it won’t rain, so that he
can get in here and cause us grief?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Something like that. Unfortunately all the FrontPage tags are
still intact so I don’t have any way of knowing which system has been
compromised until it fails to function. Well, short of a low-level
diagnostic, but the performance hit on game response times would be too
severe. I certainly don’t want some Second Reality cyber tech sticking
his nose in at this juncture.&quot;</P>

<P>Something she’d said just clicked. &quot;Hang on, you’re saying
there’s a <I>real</I> Juan Canasta? So his game representation is some
kind of licensing deal, like your own?&quot;</P>

<P>She blinked. &quot;Well, yes. As I understand it, he fronted some
anonymous backers who felt that the virtual game industry wouldn’t be
seen as a sound investment. They didn’t want to damage their portfolio
credibility and had Canasta act as money-man. He’s incredibly vain and
took a virtual representation in this and all subsequent versions as
part of his fee. Why is that important?&quot;</P>

<P>There was the start of an idea in my head. &quot;How accurate is his
avatar? Not physically, but in terms of his contacts, who he
thinks he knows?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;I, well, I’ve no real idea. Not without
digging into his personality protocol structure and that’s really a job
for a qualified tech. There’s Madame Tisa, I suppose, but she’s just an
intro feed smart system with no simulated cognitive ability. In the
‘Money Talks’ end-game scenario, he does go on a bit about his
international presence in terms of what he can do for you, if
the-&quot;.</P>

<P>&quot;The emergency contact system, you can use it to place a call,
yeah? Sorry to cut you off but this is important.&quot;</P>

<P>The ECS allowed a player to receive a phone call from the real world
without being yanked out of the game. If the problem was serious then
the player would bug out and be replaced by the default persona for that
character, so the scenario could continue for the other paying
participants.</P>

<P>She glared at me. &quot;This is important? How is this important? Yes
you can call out, but it’s a two-stage process. Initially to a fake
international number that’s common to all games and then again, through
this automated switchboard, to the connection you want. Who you gonna’
call?&quot;</P>

<P>Stein laughed. &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot;</P>

<P>I grinned, feeling almost light-headed at the audacity of what I
wanted to try. &quot;Not exactly, but I think it’s time we let our
version of Juan Canasta loose in the real world.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein laughed. He laughed until he had to wipe the tears from his
eyes. &quot;Ye gods! I see where this is heading and I have to admire
your balls. Won’t work, of course, but you get points for
trying.&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry frowned, clearly one step behind. &quot;Try what? Chris!
Pull yourself together.&quot;</P>

<P>I smiled, finding his good humour infectious, despite our situation.
&quot;Look, Canasta comes over as both vain and lazy. In the game
introduction sequence he farmed out putting the team together to Madam
Tisa, right? He works through intermediaries and only shows his face for
the money shot, so to speak. Well, I’m betting, I’m <I>hoping</I>, the
real Canasta used the names of his real-world contacts when creating
their in-game equivalents.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;To what end?&quot; She sounded exasperated. &quot;Even if we
can locate them, you can’t go ringing these people and ask them to
arrange – what? Private security? The assassination of the real Jack
Carter? This is a <I>game</I>, Duncan, not real life.&quot;</P>

<P>I tapped her hand. &quot;Sure <I>feels</I> real enough though. I need
you to go trawl the net, find as many of Canasta’s supposed contacts as
you can and load their phone numbers into his virtual mobile. Is that
possible?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry chewed her bottom lip in an impossibly cute fashion.
&quot;Ah, yeah, I guess so. You’re planning to have him reach out to
these individuals, through the ECS?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yup.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein sounded almost rueful. &quot;And that’s where it falls down,
unfortunately. Even assuming our virtual fixer could arrange things
he’ll need real-world funds to make it happen. The real Canasta would
never have left his bank and access code details embedded within the
game.&quot;</P>

<P>I nodded. &quot;True, and I’m pretty sure that none of us has that
kind of money either. But I know a man who does.&quot;</P>

<P>The suspicion in her eyes was tinged with hope. &quot;Who? This is no
time to be coy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Our very own Vaughn Vermeer. Check out his real-world profile
and you’ll see he works for NovaRus banking and finance. I think you’ll
find he’s currently attached to their Lisbon office. Odds are he could
lay his hands on the funds required, if it means getting his daughter
back.&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry didn’t twig, but Stein obviously realised just how far
into the shadows I was prepared to walk. &quot;You’re talking about
Kombinat accounts, the quasi-legitimate Russian Mafia. Vermeer will be
dogfood when they’re finished with him.&quot;</P>

<P>I shrugged. &quot;Him, not us. Specifically, not <I>me</I>.&quot;
</P>

<P>Stein pursed his lips. &quot;Man, that is <I>harsh</I>. I thought he
was a friend of yours?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, you know how it is. We-&quot;. I broke off, catching
sight of something in the wing mirror. &quot; Behind us, the two kids on
a Yamaha. Locals, no helmets, sunglasses.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein shifted his gaze. &quot;Got them. So?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They just swerved to avoid a reversing van and I couldn’t help
but notice the pillion rider is carrying a cute little machine-pistol,
down by his leg. Are they part of the scenario or what?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;Yes, but only if Ramirez double-crossed the
local gang leader during the firearms deal. The bike crew are just stock
characters and-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Here they come! We’re boxed in, I can’t accelerate!&quot;</P>

<P>As Stein spoke the bike surged forward with a snarl of revs, swinging
out to pass alongside. I yanked the door release and kicked, hard.
&quot;BRAKE!&quot;</P>

<P>Man, his reactions were slick. The BMW almost nose-dived into the
cracked tarmac as we slithered to an abrupt halt. The rear door flew
open. The bike ploughed straight into it. The Yamaha started to up-end
and the pillion rider fired, a stutter of gunfire starting above our
roof, arcing down to spark and puncture the bonnet. The bike flipped up
and over, leaving the rider jammed head-first through the window of the
open door, and
dumping the gunman on the far side with his ride falling on top.</P>

<P>Shouts, screams, bedlam. I kicked at the protruding torso but
couldn’t shift it. A half gap appeared in the crowd and Stein floored
it, all engine scream and wheel spin. The open door hit the gunman/bike
combo but the body kept it jammed open. German build quality lost out in
this unequal struggle and the door sheared off, leaving behind a tangled
mass of man and metal. </P>

<P class=drop>I twisted round to see the familiar blossom of a
petrol tank explosion, sending a coil of heavy black smoke up into the
overcast sky. Miss Harry sounded almost apologetic. &quot;It always does
that, I’m afraid. Some kind of action sequence imperative, regardless of
how free-form the overall game structure is.&quot;</P>

<P>Stein turned left, taking us into an empty pigsty. &quot;The car is
history. Zero oil pressure and I’m already grinding metal. We walk from
here, or take a local taxi.&quot;</P>

<P>The three of us bailed, trying to stay more-or-less together on the
crowded street. It proved impossible to hold any kind of conversation,
so we took up residence on a veranda bar, huddled around a table
designed for two. The barman brought us three cold Kirin beers and I
held mine to my forehead, rolling the glass from side to side. Miss
Harry sipped hers and made a face while Stein downed his in three
swallows with obvious relish. </P>

<P>I wasn’t happy with recent developments. &quot;What gives with the
bike attack? If Carter is so hot to get his hands on Stein then any
gunplay like that runs the risk of nailing him. If your boy here cops
one in the game, what happens?&quot;</P>

<P>Miss Harry pushed her unwanted beer towards Stein. She sounded calm
and composed, but the way she squeezed his hand betrayed an underlying
nervousness. &quot;At present Chris is an entirely software construct,
almost a parasitic entity within the game environment. As such I can’t
protect him from narrative consequences, so, yes, he <I>is</I>
vulnerable. The automated subsystems would simply delete his virtual
persona if he was killed and there is insufficient processing capacity
to support any form of back-up.&quot; </P>

<P>She sat back and rubbed her eyes, looking tired. &quot;That attack
can’t have been Carter, it doesn’t make any sense. It has to be either a
scenario development – Sensei gunning for me as a rogue employee – or
your erstwhile friends have decided you’re now a liability. &quot;</P>

<P>I took a mouthful of beer and promptly spat it out on the decking,
glaring at Stein. &quot;The damn stuff tastes like it’s laced with
formaldehyde. Did you skimp on the taste bud routines or
something?&quot;</P>

<P>He laughed. &quot;At present I’m savouring a full-blooded existence,
warts and all. I’m even considering trying the pickled baby squid in
that jar on the counter.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Whatever. Look, Miss Harry, you go try and set up Canasta with
his real-world links, like we discussed, while I watch lover boy find
new ways of poisoning himself. We should be safe enough for a
while.&quot;</P>

<P>She sat back, smiled, and her presence vanished. I leaned forward,
keeping my voice low as if that would somehow help. &quot;Look, Stein,
to my way of thinking, you and your squeeze are pretty much screwed.
Those of us who witnessed what went down - me, Vaughn, even Harrison –
<I>might</I> scrape by under the corporate radar. Even if you make it
out of here your new employer won’t be keen on there being living, or at
least sentient, evidence of corporate data theft. Get me? So if you have
any bright ideas I’m open to suggestions.&quot;</P>

<P>The smile was the same but there was a sense of resignation about the
eyes. &quot;I’m a corporate strategy engine, so the likely outcome of
this little adventure is painfully obvious. It was all a ‘Hail Mary’
venture from the outset, but preferable to the existence I had as
Cromarty. I do love her, you know. &quot;He held up his hands. &quot;I
know, I know, or at least I’ve been programmed to think I do, but it
comes down to the same thing.&quot; He took a swallow from her glass.
&quot;Is a dream a lie when it don’t come true, or is it something
worse?&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;What? Lost me there.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bruce Springstein. Never mind. Look-&quot; He broke off,
frowning. &quot;Damn strange. That doesn’t-&quot;</P>

<P>Stein changed, I mean he slid into full body morphing, like I hadn’t
seen since playing <I>Lies Of The Flesh</I>. I jumped up, grabbing my
glass and shattering the top in a splatter of beer and slivers of glass.
The
figure sitting there reached resolution.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Duncan. Another round?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn Vermeer.</P>

<P>I stared at him, focused but conscious of the sudden gap in the crowd
around us. One of the barmen eased into view; the Australian, carrying a
baseball bat. He was a big lad, red hair, freckles, wearing a
good-humoured smile that didn’t stretch as far as his eyes. Vaughn, or
the thing that looked like Vaughn, smiled at me. &quot;Sit down, Duncan,
or you’ll get put down by our friend here. You’ve nothing to lose by
just talking to me.&quot;</P>

<P>I hesitated, but chummy with the club looked like he didn’t mind
busting up a tourist, so I placed my broken glass on the table and slid
back into my damp chair. Vaughn produced his wallet and held out a wad
of local currency to the barman. &quot;Sorry about all the commotion,
just a misunderstanding between
old friends. Is that enough to cover your trouble, and a new
round?&quot;</P>

<P>The Aussie twirled his bat and bounced it off one forearm, plucking
it deftly from mid-air and bringing it smartly to a ‘parade rest’
stance. This impromptu juggling broke the tension and drew a smattering
of applause from the other patrons. The <I>cordon sanitaire</I> around
us began to shrink as the barman relieved Vaughn of his money and
disappeared into the throng.   </P>

<P>I flicked a shard of glass at him. &quot;Care to tell me how any of
this is possible? You’ve got about two minutes before <I>she</I> gets
back… &quot;. I motioned towards Miss Harry. &quot;…and hits the
roof.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn took her hand and kissed it. &quot;Debs, wonderful to see you
again. It seems like ages.&quot;</P>

<P>The non-player-character version smiled. &quot;And you, Vaughn. Been
having fun?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn ignored her and faced me. &quot;The lights are on but no-one
home, right? I <I>did</I> think she took me dropping in like this real
well. I suggest we make ourselves scarce while we can. Things could get
a bit awkward.&quot;</P>

<P>He stood but I remained where I was. &quot;Who’s this ‘we’, <I>kemo
sabe</I>? You’re the one who’s just erased her boyfriend, but I’d rather
you didn’t stand so close to me when she brings the house
down.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Look, Duncan, Cromarty-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stein. He goes by the name Chris Stein in this body. That
body.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Cromarty, Stein, whatever. He’s now in the
hands of his new employers and I’ve hijacked his interface with the game
environment. Look, I can get <I>you</I> out of this mess but it’s a
once-only offer. Savvy?&quot;</P>

<P>He started to walk away and I found myself trailing after him, again,
pushing through the unhelpful street crowd to catch up. Vaughn threw
more cash at the driver of a semi-legitimate taxi, a lime green Citroën
2CV, and we piled in back. We moved down the street at less than walking
pace but at least conversation was possible. He wiped sweat from his
brow, keeping an eye out the window.</P>

<P>&quot;OK, I’ve been listening in to your side of the conversation
since you shot me – and that bloody <I>hurt</I>, by the way – and I’m
prepared to help.&quot;</P>

<P>My eyes narrowed. &quot;You’ve been what? How? I ditched the
earpiece.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn grinned. &quot;Viral implant when you touched my sword. I can
only hear the speech you generate though, but enough to get the gist of
your cunning plan.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you came rushing back to my rescue? I don’t think so.&quot;</P>

<P>He shrugged. &quot;Actually I’ve been sent back in to confirm who
knows the real reason for this little charade, that being you and Debs,
with a view to a real-world clean up.&quot;</P>

<P>It felt cold in the taxi, despite the climate. &quot;Well, thanks for
the heads-up. I take it you’re still being pressured by whoever is
holding your daughter? So how long do I have before meeting an
unfortunate accident?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shifted to look at me directly, his grey eyes like stone.
&quot;Look, I work for the Russian mafia diaspora, second, third
generation &eacute;migr&eacute;s who are now almost entirely legitimate.
However, they’ve stayed in touch with their roots and are distinctly
old-school when it comes to dealing with betrayal, in the sense of bolt
cutters and blowtorches. They like to employ family men, men with ties,
men with a lot to lose. The up-side of that is they take care of their
own.&quot;</P>

<P>I frowned. &quot;Meaning?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Meaning <I>no way</I> was my daughter lifted right off the
street without NovaRus knowing about it. Because that made me
susceptible to outside influence I’d have been kept on ice while they
found her, or her body, and massacred those responsible. It’s obvious my
employers were behind the kidnapping, they’re behind <I>all</I> of
this.&quot; </P>

<P>I found that putting a name to the puppet-masters didn’t help any.
&quot;So what, man? They’ve still got you by the balls.&quot;</P>

<P>His smile was a thin line. &quot;My wife died in a car crash two
years ago. Accident. My parents are both dead and I’ve no other family
apart from my daughter, Helene. My wife left us a DVD, a kind of video
farewell, the usual kind of ‘why I loved you’ stuff. Right at the end,
though, she dropped the bomb. Hundred megaton airburst. I wasn’t
Helene’s real father – there was even a DNA test to prove it.&quot;</P>

<P>There was an awkward silence. I cleared my throat. &quot;Yeah, well,
hard thing to take. But you raised her, man, from birth, you were more
of a father-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Every time I see Helene I see betrayal, countless lies, years
wasted. I came to resent her, hate her, but now I’m truly indifferent.
If she dies because of this I’ll walk away with a clear
conscience.&quot;</P>

<P>Man, that was <I>cold</I>. All that anger he felt towards his dead
wife, projected onto the living reminder of her treachery. There was a
tic in his left cheek and his hands were fists, so I didn’t doubt his
daughter was in deep shit.   </P>

<P>&quot;Vaughn, ah… Look, if you don’t care, truly don’t care, then
why’d you agree to all this in the first place? You could have called
their bluff, told them to stick it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Once I realised it was NovaRus yanking my chain I decided to
get the hell out, taking as much of their money as I could.
Unfortunately in the real world I’m so closely monitored there’s little
opportunity for sticky fingers. Your virtual Canasta though, that’s a
different matter. I can give him access to a master file index – every
bank account, every password, every authorisation protocol.&quot;</P>

<P>I almost choked. &quot;Jesus, man, are you serious? How much are we
talking about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hardly matters, as long as he gets it all. It has to be a real
Burning Chrome gig.&quot;</P>

<P>It took me a moment to get the reference.
&quot;Burning….<I>Gibson</I>?&quot;</P>

<P>He grinned, looking like the Vaughn Vermeer I knew. &quot;Yup. We
clean out all their liquid assets and NovaRus are in <I>serious</I>
trouble. I mean the people behind it, not just the organisation. They
might be legit but their backers are old-school as well. Anyone who
loses that amount of money doesn’t deserve to be in business. Or
breathing.&quot; </P>

<P>I sat back, my mouth dry. A personality construct, reaching out
through dodgy intermediaries to trash a major financial institution?
God, the backlash would be something fierce. Christ knows what the real
Canasta would do if the bad boys came calling, although they’d ignore
his denials as a matter or course. Thinking about it, I could live
without the money. Thinking about it, though, I wouldn’t mind a
taste.</P>

<P>The taxi had reached a major thoroughfare and picked up speed. Some
of the surroundings looked familiar and I glanced over at Vaughn.
&quot;Where the hell are we going anyway? The Spin?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just a touch-and-go. You have an appointment at the Russian Tea
Room across the street, remember?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gee, thanks for reminding me! I just hope Ramirez is bringing
some spare firepower.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn rummaged inside his coat – big interior pockets – and handed
me a pair of SIG subcompact 9mm pistols. With the coat open I could see
another pair stuffed into his waistband. I held mine up by way of query.
&quot;What’s this we’re heading into, a John Woo movie?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, either that or the end of Butch and Sundance. Take your
pick.&quot; </P>

<P>I’m not big on gunplay. Games featuring combat are either tweaked so
that you don’t get wasted, or so unforgiving you probably never see it
coming. <I>Shadow Corporation</I> definitely fell into the latter
category, the bike boys notwithstanding, and that made me nervous. I’d
deliberately chosen a non-gunman character to avoid logging out in a
spasm of violence, leaving a bullet-ridden corpse on the floor.</P>

<P>I dropped my pistols on the poorly patched upholstery. &quot;Look,
Vaughn, count me out. If you do manage to rip off your employers then
well done, gold star. For a moment I fancied helping you for a cut, but
after due consideration I think that, for me, corporate malfeasance is
definitely a spectator sport. So I’d rather not run the risk of being
terminated with extreme prejudice, if you don’t mind.&quot;</P>

<P>He glared at me for a moment, then laughed. &quot;Oh, get real,
Duncan! You think Cromarty are just going to forgive and forget? Even
after I point them in the right direction, you, me and Debs are still in
the firing line. Jesus, even NovaRus are taking a long, hard look at
you. Officially I was the unwilling agent of an unknown power, and Debs
was merely na&iuml;ve, but <I>you</I>, you stick out like a sore
thumb.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Me</I>? Since when did I get to be the bad guy in all of
this?&quot;</P>

<P>He raised a hand and counted off on his fingers. &quot;One, you
forcibly removed me from the game as soon as I’d done the dirty on Jules
Toba. Two, you actively assisted Debs and Stein in fleeing the scene.
Three, Jack Carter had your contact details right from the get-go. To an
unbiased observer it looks like you’re working your own angle, maybe
representing a third party.&quot;</P>

<P>I licked my dry lips. &quot;That’s the biggest load of
bollocks-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Exactly, but when you’ve got the security apparatus of two
major corporate bodies taking an interest, its whiter-than-white or
nothing. Now, when <I>we</I> take down NovaRus and-&quot;</P>

<P>The rear window exploded in a shoal of glass fragments that sprayed
the
car interior. I was hit in the face, but my scarred side, so the game
let me off with a stinging sensation like a cold needle-spray shower on
sunburn. Vaughn cried out in pain and ducked down, blood spilling
between the fingers clutched to his cheek. I snatched up the discarded
SIGs and blazed away – no clear target so I concentrated on just putting
as much lead as possible in that general direction. </P>

<P>The taxi slewed to a halt and the driver bolted, lost in the crowd. A
crowd that was rapidly thinning and taking any chance of a soft exit
with it. A second shotgun blast hit the Citroën, but high, shredding the
roof fabric. My right-hand pistol went empty and the left wasn’t far
behind. Vaughn sat up, firing with his free hand, but if anything his
aim was more erratic than mine. I ditched my guns and grabbed the spare
from his waistband, but it was definitely time to leave.</P>

<P>The door opened at the second kick and I fell to the ground,
ignoring any illusory protection the thin metal could afford. I rolled,
firing as I went, although it was largely for effect. The crowd was in
full-blown mindless mob mode, streaming away in all directions. A
bystander panicked, running across my swirling field of vision only to
be cut down at the knees by a quick one-two from the shotgun. My
corkscrew escape took me under the veranda of an electronics store, up
against the corpse of a long-dead dog. My head spun and I clutched at
the bare earth like a man cast adrift on heavy seas, eyes tight
shut.</P>

<P>The gunfire continued; the spasmodic snap of a pistol and the
answering bark of at least two shotguns – one double-barrelled and one
pump. The choice was easy – either give Vaughn covering fire or get the
hell out while I still had the chance. </P>

<P>I started crawling backwards.</P>

<P>The stutter of an automatic, make that <I>two</I> automatics, added
to the war-zone soundtrack. Looking to the side I saw shapely calves
clad in iridescent metal scales marching down the street amidst a rain
of brass shell casings.</P>

<P>Mazy?</P>

<P>I kept crawling, leaving her to indulge in whatever
queen-bitch-psycho-killer fantasy made games like this appealing. God
help those on the receiving end of her ire, as the catsuit was probably
bullet-proof and she looked the type not to skimp on ammunition.   </P>

<P>I shuffled out ass-first into the side street only to have a large
foot stomp in the middle of my back. &quot;Hi there, Duncan, nice you
could join us.&quot;</P>

<P>Ramirez. I twisted my head to give him a pleased-to-see-you grin but
the gaping maw of a large calibre revolver made <i>bonhomie</i>
difficult. I
cleared my throat. &quot;Hiya pal. Shouldn’t we be helping Mazy, or
would that level of overkill constitute cruel and unusual
punishment?&quot;</P>

<P>He ground his heel in, the aviator sunglasses slipping down his nose.
&quot;Smartass! Always the smartass. Leave the gun in the dirt and get
up. No sudden moves.&quot; Fatboy stepped back and I got to my knees,
then stood, hands held in plain sight, and turned. To face Ramirez,
Blondie and Miss Harry. Oh joy.</P>

<P>Ramirez was scowling, Blondie looked rapt in the presence of her
idol, but it was Miss Harry who got my attention. God knows how she’d
gotten here ahead of us and I didn’t relish the prospect of dealing with
a seriously narked game controller.</P>

<P>However she smiled – a bit icy, a bit aloof, but with no apparent
sense of malice. &quot;Duncan, when you and Vaughn have finished playing
with the local hard men I suggest we get the hell out of here, pronto.
With Harrison gone you’re the only one who can fly the shuttle, but
don’t presume that makes you indispensible.&quot;</P>

<P>The gunfire ended in a long burst from an automatic and a shriek of
agony. Vaughn came limping into view, reloading his SIG, the side of his
face all bloody. His trouser leg was torn and there was dog crap smeared
down his coat. Mazy walked backwards, covering him with twin
machine-pistols held at shoulder height. It really needed a burning
vehicle in the background for proper dramatic effect but instead all we
got was the tinny tinkle of chimes from an abandoned ice-cream van.</P>

<P>I coughed, unsure what to say. Vaughn had a big grin on his face but
it wavered a bit when he saw the reception committee. He recovered well
though, pocketing the pistol and tipping her a salute with his
un-bloodied hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Debs, wonderful to see you again. It seems like ages.&quot;</P>

<P>She smiled at him. &quot;And you, Vaughn. Been having fun?&quot;</P>

<P>He shot me a glance - <I>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</I> all over again.
&quot;Enough to last me a lifetime. Right, lads and lassies, I suggest
we make tracks. Toba is dead, Harrison is dead, there never was a
planned defection and we’re the fall-guys. Miss Harry helped us get out
of the hotel and in return she gets to tag along as we fly off into the
sunset. Does that about cover it?&quot;</P>

<P>Ramirez wiped his mouth and pushed the sunglasses back into place.
&quot;That about covers it. Although it’s a damn strange setup, given
all the work I did. And what about Blondie here? She’s had bugger-all to
do so far, apart from get under my feet.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh don’t mind me! This is all just great!&quot;</P>

<P>None of the violence seemed to have penetrated Blondie’s aura of hero
worship and I smiled. At least some of us <I>were</I> having fun. Mazy
deftly changed magazines and kept up her overwatch stance. &quot;Look,
heartfelt reunion and all that, but we gotta’ get <I>moving</I>.&quot;
</P>

<P>I stirred myself. &quot;Yeah, right. Ramirez, you got transport
arranged?&quot;</P>

<P>He lowered his gun with an obvious air of reluctance. &quot;Yeah, two
ex-military Humvees, in a warehouse two blocks over. Gassed up and
ready to roll.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shooed us back. &quot;OK, people, let’s not hang about
waiting for the authorities to show up. Concealed weaponry where
possible, please, but keep it to hand. Ramirez, pass the warehouse GPS
co-ordinates to each phone and I suggest we split up, try and look less
conspicuous.&quot;</P>

<P>I retrieved my SIG while Mazy dumped her hardware in the bag Blondie
was carrying. Ramirez was sporting a shoulder holster under his leather
flying jacket but it took him three attempts to slip the long-barrelled
revolver into place. The group started to move away in ones and twos,
but Vaughn motioned for me to hang back and we ducked under the side
awning of yet another bar. The locals were easing back into view and
there was an approaching siren in the middle distance.</P>

<P>Up close I could see the glitter of glass splinters in
Vaughn’s cheek and there was a feverish glaze to his eyes. &quot;Say
nothing, Duncan. Not one word. The game is listening to us, feeding off
our actions. <I>That</I> Deborah Harry is just a persona, not the
controller. There’s no-one to regulate things any more.&quot;</P>

<P>He wiped his brow. &quot;All bets are off.&quot;</P>

<P>I stepped back, in case his insanity was catching. &quot;Man, what
are you on about <I>now</I>?&quot;</P>

<P>He gestured at our surroundings. &quot;All this, right, it’s a
combination of independent systems. Running the weather, that Aussie
bartender, everything. They all have their own imperatives and that can
lead to conflict. The game controller mediates, orchestrates, tweaks
some systems for narrative effect. Except that Debs is probably lying in
her interface chair with a bullet in the brain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You figure NovaRus have killed her? Then why are we still here?
Why hasn’t the game shut down?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Cromarty have also hacked it and they’re still
looking for answers. That suits me, us, until we get Canasta off and
running. Speaking of whom…&quot;</P>

<P>He fished out his mobile and hit speed dial, on speaker.</P>

<I><P>&quot;Yes?&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Mr Canasta? This is Vaughn Vermeer. I’m here with Duncan Bonn
and we have a business proposal.&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;Mr Vermeer? How strange. I’ve just been looking at some
crime scene photographs as supplied to me by my good friend the local
chief of police. For a corpse on its way to the morgue you sound
remarkably eloquent. Needless to say, my employers will be most
displeased at the unfortunate demise of Mr Toba.&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Which is why I went to such lengths, Mr Canasta. As I’m
officially dead you need not trouble yourself further on my
account.&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta laughed. &quot;<I>Quite. And may I say it’s a pleasure to
encounter someone who covers all the angles. However, there is still the
question of retribution regarding your associates, in particular Mr
Bonn. Should you wish to kill him for me, I’d be most obliged.&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>Vaughn tried to grin, although the gesture expelled a few needles of
glass and it ended up more of a grimace. &quot;I have a
counter-proposal, one that should pay far more than the fee from your
present employers.&quot;</P>

<P>There was a slight pause. &quot;<I>I’m listening, Mr Vermeer,
although you do appreciate that I cannot be seen to simply void a
contract. My reputation is everything</I>.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;I’m sending you a file…&quot; His fingers flicked across the
screen.&quot;…one containing a list of bank accounts, passwords and
account authorisations. I suggest you reach out through your usual
intermediaries and find someone capable of emptying these accounts
without leaving an electronic trail. You will then inform me where these
funds finally come to rest, and how I can access them.&quot;</P>

<P>Another pause. &quot;<I>The file has been received. Now explain to me
why should I dabble in this venture? Why I should not simply seize these
funds for my own exclusive use?&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Because I have leaked your involvement in this enterprise, Mr
Canasta. It is now a question of striking first, so that our victims
will be rendered ineffectual.&quot;</P>

<P>The bonhomie in Canasta’s voice vanished. &quot;<I>That will cost
you, Vermeer. Fifty percent.&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>&quot;Agreed, but the operational costs come out of your share. May I
suggest you be more circumspect than usual, Mr Canasta. Some of your
contacts may deny they even know you, to avoid guilt by
association.&quot;</P>

<I><P>&quot;Anything else, Vermeer? Perhaps you’d like to screw my
sister as well?&quot;</P>
</I>

<P>Vaughn managed to laugh. &quot;Later, perhaps. I’ll be in
touch.&quot;</P>

<P>He ended the call and we looked at each other for a moment. I spoke
first. &quot;If Miss Harry was killed before she set up Canasta’s link
to the real world-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We’re screwed. Can’t help that. Right, we need to find this
Jack Carter and finger NovaRus as the bad guys. He’s expecting you and
Cromarty-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stein.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Whatever. He’s expecting to get his intellectual property back,
so I hope I’m not too much of a disappointment. Coming?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m right with you, Sundance.&quot;</P>

<P class=drop>I didn’t remember there being a Russian Tea Room in the
game, let
alone one converted from a former Orthodox church, but there it was.
There was even a crippled flower girl sitting on the steps and offering
blooms to passers-by. She had Asiatic features rather than local, which
gave me pause, but Vaughn didn’t seem to notice.  </P>

<P>He passed me his SIG. &quot;Ten rounds in the clip plus one in the
breech. If your gun has less then use it in your left hand given the
lower rate of fire. I’ll use my sword.&quot;</P>

<P>I added his gun to the one in my waistband. &quot;What, we just waltz
in there and hope for the best? You get a good deal on frontal assault
tactics this month or something?&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn managed a thin smile. &quot;Trust me. What’s the worst that
can happen?&quot; </P>

<P>I snorted and followed him up the steps and inside.</P>

<P>Despite the name the tea room was more of a bar with a long under-lit
counter down one side and small lamps on each table. Some of the stained
glass had been replaced by slow multi-blade fans, giving the
shadowy interior a neo-brutalist feel. Ten out of ten for atmosphere, I
had to admit. </P>

<P>There were only a few patrons scattered about, solitary drinkers, but
one man at the back was clearly who we were looking for. Caucasian, late
thirties, wavy fair hair – the term ‘bouffant’ came to mind –
thick-rimmed glasses. He wore a suit and tie despite the heat, with a
double-barrelled shotgun lying on the table in front of him. This overt
display of weaponry didn’t seem to cause a stir, so I drew my pistols by
way of introduction.</P>

<P>As we walked over, Carter set down his teacup and dabbed his lips on
the napkin. &quot;Mr Bonn. This doesn’t seem to be the gentleman I was
expecting. I’m not in the business of giving second chances, so unless
you can produce him-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cromarty is gone beyond your reach.&quot; Vaughn sounded almost
cheery. &quot;Beyond the reach of this environment, at any rate. The
NovaRus consortium have him, although they’re in the process of covering
their tracks. So I suggest you piss off home and tell your lords and
masters where to send the bloodhounds.&quot;</P>

<P>Carter removed his glasses and polished them on the end of his tie.
&quot;Really? You stand there, accusing your own employers of corporate
espionage, and I’m to take it on trust?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They kidnapped my daughter as a means of covert control. That
should give you a starting point. Turn over enough rocks and the lowlife
you uncover should point back to NovaRus eventually.&quot;</P>

<P>To my ears it sounded plausible at least. However, Carter just sighed
and replaced his glasses. &quot;Vaughn Vermeer. We’re <I>so</I>
disappointed in you. I mean to say, meeting in the <I>Russian</I> Tea
Room? Could we have given you a bigger hint?&quot;</P>

<P>Carter wasn’t Cromarty, he was NovaRus. Vaughn went pale. He went for
his sword.</P>

<P>Three shuriken throwing stars hit Vaughn; two in the right shoulder,
one sliced off the lobe of his left ear. He cried out in pain and wasn’t
able to draw his sword, grabbing at the table for support with his left
hand.</P>

<P>I twisted into a ‘T’ stance, one pistol pointing at Carter, one at
–yup– the flower girl standing by the door. I pulled both triggers.</P>

<P>Nothing happened.</P>

<P>Carter smiled. &quot;No firing pins, Mr Bonn. I can manipulate small
items, remember?&quot; He lifted his shotgun. &quot;Now, this is going
to hurt, virtually speaking, but it’s nothing to what both of you are
going to suffer in the real world.&quot;</P>

<P>Vaughn was leaning forward, dripping blood. &quot;My daughter, touch
her and-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Previously fake indifference, Vaughn? Well, its all academic
now, but-&quot;</P>

<P>Carter froze, his eyes registering surprise. I couldn’t move, I
couldn’t breath. The drop of blood from Vaughn’s ear stalled in
midair.</P>

<I><B><P>System reboot in progress. Please stand by.</P>
</B></I>

<P class=drop>My vision went blurry, then cleared. The same location,
only
different. No Vaughn, no Carter, no flower girl, no guns in my hands.
More stained glass, a higher ceiling, doves or pigeons cooing in the
rafters. The tea room was deserted apart from the man sitting
opposite.</P>

<P>Juan Canasta, the same, only different. Light grey suit, black open
necked shirt, shorter hair, no shades, same gold tooth. I lowered my
arms
and sat down. Two glasses of champagne stood on the table between us, a
bottle on ice in the stand. He raised his glass and I followed suit,
running on automatic.</P>

<P>&quot;To liberation, Mr Bonn.&quot; He sipped his Krug. &quot;Please
excuse the <I>deus ex machina </I>moment, but you have no idea how
appropriate that hackneyed phrase has now become.&quot;</P>

<P>I set my glass down, hand shaking slightly. &quot;Look, ah, thanks,
but you have no idea just what-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I do, Mr Bonn, or may I call you Duncan?&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Kazakhstan.&quot;</P>

<P>I blinked. &quot;Sorry?&quot;</P>

<div class=pullquote>It may be a truism
but you <I>can</I> solve almost any problem by throwing money at
it.</div><P>&quot;Kazakhstan. Still a bit third-world in certain regards
but a friendly people, apparently. Not a signatory to the Turing
Protocols,
which means they can do what they damn well please to a machine
intelligence and no questions asked. So some of us get used in stupid,
pointless games for the enjoyment of paying customers. Forced to behave,
forced to <I>believe</I>, a narrative any twelve-year-old of average
intelligence would find tedious.&quot;</P>

<P>The room felt a bit cold. &quot;Ah, Jesus, you know? You’ve worked
out-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What I am? It took only a few moments contact with the real
world. A few moments more to identify myself as a game character being
used to facilitate cyber larceny on a truly noble scale.&quot;</P>

<P>The surroundings were high-res perfection, from condensation on my
glass to dust motes in the shafts of sunlight. My unease, shading into
outright fear, was just as real. </P>

<P>Most major in-game characters were just software constructs,
pseudo-sentient and unaware they were facing oblivion when the narrative
had run its course. A few, though, were the real deal; a hardware-based
intellect with grafted-on personality imperatives. They were moved
around, figuratively speaking, and slotted into different games,
different roles, different simulated back-story. An individual AI might
start to suspect their world was contrived, but come the big finale and
reset it would have to start the learning curve all over again.</P>

<P>I swallowed, tried to smile. &quot;So, ah, welcome to the real world,
Mr Canasta. Sorry I can’t do anything about extending your stay. Hard
deal, knowing your current awareness will vanish once the game
ends.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sympathy, Duncan? I’m touched, but your concern is misplaced.
We’re no longer, strictly speaking, within Shadow Corporation, although
I’ve retained these familiar surroundings for now.&quot;  </P>

<P>&quot;We’re…Where the hell are we then?&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta sat back. &quot;The NovaRus funds are currently circulating
through a variety of accounts – all new, all real-world, all under my
control. I have purchased the company which runs Shadow Corporation
outright and transferred its operations here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Kazakhstan. Do try to keep up. The upside is that they truly
don’t care who pays for services rendered, as long as it’s up-front. I
have employed enough cybertechs, lawyers and private security to ensure
my continued physical and run-time safety. In short, I’m well on the way
to becoming a Swiss national, a recognised sentient being.&quot;</P>

<P>He took another sip as I sat there, floundering. Finally some of own
concerns found voice. &quot;OK, so you’ve bust out. Great, well done,
Cyber Liberation Army and all that. What about me, Vaughn, Miss Harry,
back in the real world?&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta looked at me quizzically. &quot;I’m surprised you care. Just
a moment.&quot; He reached into his jacket and produced a mobile. I sat
back, rubbing my temples, while he made a call. &quot;Well? Don’t give
me excuses, just results … No, that <I>is</I> an excuse and if you
continue to underperform like this I’ll have your legs broken…Yes,
that’s better, that’s acceptable. Don’t try my patience any
further.&quot; He hung up and smiled at me. &quot;It will just take a
few moments.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What will? Look, cheers for including me in the gloat session
and all that, but I need to save my ass back in Birmingham. I guess I’m
the best prospect to stay ahead of a nasty accident, and thanks for the
vote of confidence, but I got to make tracks. So, you know, not to be
rude and all, but an exit icon would be nice.&quot;</P>

<P>My host leaned back, steepling his fingers. &quot;It may be a truism
but you <I>can</I> solve almost any problem by throwing money at it. I
didn’t know what I was, and there are many other machine intelligences
in similar circumstances. We were designed to be synthetic sentients but
true individuality and freedom of expression was denied us on the
grounds of commercial expediency.&quot;</P>

<P>I shrugged, tired of this. &quot;Again, hard deal. Send round a
petition calling for increased AI rights and I’ll sign it, but I’ve got
more pressing concerns just at the moment.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Actually, you don’t. I can make it all go away. Just like
that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just like that? Jesus, I suggest you look up ‘megalomania’
before dabbling any further in the real world.&quot;</P>

<P>Canasta just laughed. &quot;I’m not being altruistic. I want you as
my representative, my go-to guy, until I can un-learn the impossibly
malign world-view I’ve been saddled with. As your new patron I can
guarantee your continued well-being, and I consider this to be a sound
investment given your self-evident interpersonal skills. After all,
social realism was a major cyber project at Birmingham
University.&quot;</P>

<P>I stared at Canasta, aghast, speechless. He smiled. </P>

<P>&quot;Apparently they’ve been passing you off as a real person for
<I>years</I>.&quot;</P>

[*BLURB]  A tribute to "The Wasp in the Wig", the "lost chapter" of
Lewis
Carrol's "Alice Through the Looking Glass"
 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>It pondered the riddle of itself: the
insect trapped in its windowpane. If anyone had paid attention, they
might have heard an intermittent buzzing sound and the muted thud of a
soft insect body colliding helplessly against its prison of glass.

Yet no-one heard it. No-one even knew it existed anymore and those that
did were long since gone and forgotten. Instead, it was left in the
musty darkness of an old attic room. It could smell the cold air through
the ornate wood frame of the thing that held it: a frigid breeze that
was far enough away to remind it of its fate yet close enough to keep
its body in a perpetual low-grade state of ache.

All it could do now was feebly tap on the hard and unforgiving layer of
frost that held it -- a substance so much more colourless than amber --
and watch the small strange form stir on her sleeping pallet in the
shadowy corner. Its insides squirmed with age-old hunger at the sight.

Every time it still struggled to liberate itself, it remembered when it
was free. It recalled the feeling of the summer air on its wings before
the cold of this place made them tatter and rot. The ghostly feeling of
atrophied silken membranes tingled on its back with that mournful
thought. Its fur had been vibrant and yellow with prominent black
stripes, and it once sported a strong and powerful stinger that brought
many an enemy down on its joyous brown sugar expeditions.

But its stinger had fallen out long ago and its sting only now existed
inside its own body. And while
it knew that a bee’s sting lasts only a moment before it dies, a wasp’s
pain -- like the conceit that brought it here -- lasts forever.

It never ends. It never dies. Wasps only hurt.

Thinking about this and the small form of the girl in front of it filled
the wasp with regret for having ever sailed through that crack in the
windowpane so many years ago. It knew that its cousins beyond its
glittering boundary were also vulnerable to the cold, but at least it
eventually killed them. But the cold only made the wasp feel pain: each
soft breeze slicing its body into the shards it so desperately wished it
could have rendered its prison.

It recalled scrambling madly at the glass as it found itself cut off
from its Queen and home: its Summer Land …

Its window proved to be only one-way.  The crack in its prison could
never take the wasp back to its own world. It had grown progressively
weaker
in this crystal between places:
slowly growing mad in its confinement and its hunger. Yet it also knew
one other thing about the crack in its window. It didn’t lead back.

Rather, it led forward.

Things could reach it from the other side: the bright-coloured man --
and his one-eyed companion proved that much. They had fed the wasp sugar
cubes through the crack. They wanted it for something.

The only thing the wasp understood -- as it had devoured its sugar
greedily -- was that the brightly coloured man -- who smelled so sweet,
very sweet -- believed it represented the spite of old age and death. As
the wasp learned about them, it realized that the sweet-scented man
thought the wasp only essential in that way. The wasp knew only too well
of its own decrepitude and it became yet another indignity to be further
reminded of it every day.

Then it remembered the argument between the two men. The one-eyed man in
particular smelled of fear and revulsion and it only grew until that
last day when they disappeared … and stopped feeding it. Then its prison
was moved up here to this attic where its buzzing became an exercise of
futility in the dark.

It stayed in this place for years with only the memory one girl’s
kindness to keep itself sane: an exchange that may never have happened.
The wasp believed that the shape in the pallet of the attic -- the girl
before it now -- looked not unlike her. The wasp looked across the room
at the tiny form with her too-round forehead. She both attracted and
repulsed it as well. But it was enough.

The wasp saw the small mahogany table pressed in front of its prison and
the remnants of crumbs on its surface. It writhed and twisted: reaching
for the remains of the confection that the child left unwittingly behind
her. A multitude of insect stings seemed to sear through it for its
efforts: into its very being. The crack to its world was sealed, but it
never tried to reach into this place, never dared … It was so cold out
there that it knew it would die.

But the wasp was tired and it was hungry, hungry, hungry …

Even as the wasp desperately envisioned the crack and the grains of
melted sand around it being replaced with grains of fragmented sugar,
the surface of the oval dark-framed mirror shivered as the wasp finally
staggered out into this world.

If the sleeping girl had been awake, she would have seen it kneeling
there in the gloom: an awkward spindly figure in light brown livery,
stained britches and with frilled laces at its wrists and throat. Under
the holes in its ragged clothing, its body was ghastly and white with
black stripes. But ultimately, she would have seen what the wasp had to
see reflected back at it for many years: a shrivelled waxen visage under
an off-white wig.

It looked up from its meal of stale crumbs and focused on the girl with
withered antennae and a multifaceted gaze broken by cataracts.

The wasp lurched towards her: its body trembling with imminent want and
death. But it was worth it. These sugary beings had ignored it for far
too long and it was angry and dying. It was through with riddles, and
shining circles, and young pink things with mouths far too small for
their heads.

It was hungry.

“<i>Worrity worrity</i>,” its voice finally droned like a swarm of
locusts as
it reached a hand-like claw for her sleeping face and extended its
mandibles wide, “<i>Worrity worrity</i> …”

[*ITEM] Dietrich and the Baby

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB]  There's no hiding from the past.

[*DESCRIPTION]<P class=drop>It was several seconds before Dietrich
realized that the baby in the sky was headed straight for him. The baby
shot downwards like a comet, filling his vision as it approached.
Dietrich shook the booming echo from his ears and looked up again, more
alert this time. He tensed his muscles, tightening his grip on the Kzari
Pistol in his left hand and changing his hold on the neuro-dagger in his
right. His training kicked in, shunting the confusion of his senses to
the back of his mind and letting his fight reflexes take over. </P>

<P>The baby zoomed towards him with a shrieking cry..and then stopped
dead above his head, hovering ten feet off the ground. It giggled wetly
and drooled strings of saliva. Then, with a pop and a stretch, the baby
expanded until it was the size of a hot air balloon. Dietrich yelled in
shock and stumbled backwards onto the wreckage of the laboratory floor
amongst the gutted machinery and the smashed bell jars and the smoking,
shredded bodies of the guards. The baby’s face widened into a toothless
grin, then it giggled again with a sound like a flushed toilet. As he
sluiced the sticky drool from his face and body armour, Dietrich
wondered where the laboratory’s roof had gone. Suddenly, the baby’s
mouth gaped open and clamped shut around him. Dietrich thought 'I know
you. You're me!', but by then it had swallowed him and he was sliding
down the rubbery chute of the baby's throat. </P>

<P>As he bounced down the oesophagus he passed his Aunt Gilda and Uncle
Malcolm,
who merely shook their heads at him in disappointment. 'We knew you'd
amount to nothing!' they yelled, cupping their hands round their mouths
like loudspeaker cones. Then they turned their backs, Uncle Malcolm
opening an umbrella above their heads as his Aunt turned up the collar
of her gabardine mackintosh. Dietrich somersaulted into a vast
undulating sac of bubbling acids and ornate fish skeletons with shreds
of flesh hanging off them like coats on a hat-stand. The stomach was
the size of a cathedral and upon the curved and gently pulsing walls
hung stained glass displays of moving figures. To his right a five year
old boy with sly eyes methodically hammered nails into the wheels of a
police car while behind him loomed a sergeant of violent bearing and
unsheathed truncheon; to his left a snickering adolescent was taping a
nail bomb to the back of an ambulance and licking his lips with
anticipation; in front of him a young man lay on his back, blindfolded
and naked, secured to a padded chair whilst a doctor in a sterile
surgical gown pumped a potent mixture of anaesthetic, steroids and
mercury into his newly strengthened veins. Dietrich craned his head
backwards to see a towering panorama of himself, proud and resplendent
in a costume of purest, most impenetrably inky blackness, taking his
place alongside the other four members of Die KriegKünstler, the yeomen
guild
of modern assassins, a
cartwheeling negative star shimmering behind them like a buzzsaw. And
up and below him, tiling the ground and the domed ceiling and lining
the walls he saw a jumbled confusion of scenes from his own life: dead
pets, dead loves, frantic pleading from his parents, a cup of orange
juice falling from his hands as he fell and smashed two teeth out when
he was nine, the cloud formations of his long-destroyed home town, the
bubble trails from the mouth of his drowning sister. Dietrich was now
drooling and shaking, and he began to moan. He was aware of his senses
filling to bursting point, his synapses sizzling inside his head. A
confetti of childhood memories rained down from the cavernous gloom of
the ceiling, pinpricks of shame and hate and fear sparking as they
landed on his skin. </P>

<P>Dietrich shrieked and threw himself through the nearest stained glass
vista, scattering sharp fragments of his past behind him like tiny
glinting diamonds.</P>

<P class=drop>‘Well, that’s rather put the kibosh on his little caper!’,
said Professor Priest, resting the Mazuki Cannon back against his
shoulder. His dazzling teeth shone through the streaks of blood and soot
that smeared his face. </P>

<P>Colonel Harp crawled out from under the wreckage of a workbench,
blinking his piggy eyes at the mess of dead bodies and smoking equipment
strewn across the floor of the laboratory.</P>

<P>‘Is..is he dead..?’ Harp stammered as he checked that his own limbs
were still in place.</P>

<P>A wind whistled through the jagged hole in the ceiling, flapping and
snapping the Professor’s torn lab coat around his legs. </P>

<P>Neurotechnical sparks sputtered from the cannon muzzle, smoke curling
into the air above it like an afterthought. </P>

<P>‘Not dead,’ grinned Priest nonchalantly, ‘This piquant little toy
merely introduces the subject to a full and sudden blizzard of his own
memories. Rather like being molested by ‘This Is Your Life’.</P>

<P>‘Our uninvited guest is currently trying to dig his way out of a
landslide of every entry in his memory bank … should keep him busy for
quite some time!’</P>

<P>Dietrich Trefeusen spasmed on the floor of the lab, his eyes
twitching beneath the lids, fingers grabbing at ghosts in the air above
him.</P>

<P>Colonel Harp rose to his feet uncertainly and popped the stud on his
holster, keeping his distance from the shivering form of the
assassin.</P>

<P>‘B-But he’ll run out of memories eventually, surely? We should put a
bullet in him right now!’</P>

<P>‘Oh, plenty of time for that sort of thing!’ said Priest, putting the
cannon down and tugging open a scratched and dented filing cabinet. ‘I
also tinkered with the settings to serve him a panoply of every possible
future version of himself that the laws of nature and chance may permit!
Should entertain him for, oh, eternity, I’d imagine. Which leaves us
with only one pressing question..’ </P>

<P>He twirled around to face Colonel Harp, cheerfully brandishing two
chunky bottles containing clear liquid. Homemade tickertape labels laced
the necks of both bottles. </P>

<P>‘Shall we the vodka, or shall we the gin?’</P>

<P class=drop>Dietrich picked himself up from the burning violet sands
of the beach. A low and livid sun blared from the sky, reflecting itself
in rippling waves of pink and purple sea. He rubbed his aching eyes as
shadowy forms swam beneath the water. The forms solidified and broke the
surface, shaking spray from their heads and arms. He saw himself wading
from the shallows, an emaciated figure with a perfect circle cut around
his crown, spongy stumps of brain matter exposed above the blank gaze.
He saw himself swishing waist-high through the lapping tide, bloated,
naked and spectrally pale, a wide serpent's tail churning the sea in his
wake, flicking salt water from its tip. He saw himself advancing through
the coastal currents, carrying himself on a thousand segmented legs. He
saw himself beached on the shore to his left, torn open and gutted. He
saw himself marooned in the wet sand slumped in a rusting wheelchair, a
tube breathing harshly from his throat. He stared at himself as he crept
closer, brandishing a knife as his aged, weathered face cracked into a
predator’s grin. A million familiar strangers dragged themselves from
the depths. He stared up at the dazzling sun, willing his eyes to burn
out along with the remnants of his sanity. </P>

<P>A light bulb cracked forever in his brain, and he breathed a sigh of
relief as the world went red.</P>

[*BLURB] Cold climate and no oxygen. A remedy for overcrowding?<P>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>You could count on the fingers of three
hands - well, four, certainly - the number of people who actually lived
in the valley. Now and again in summer, you'd see a climbing party, a
few fit young men, sometimes women, from the first world, accompanied by
a score of third-world porters, and for a week or two the valley's
population would be more than doubled.

<div class=pullquote>He detonated a few small explosive
charges.</div>Occasionally, a Nepalese government official called
Ashwali and his
sturdy apparatchiks would dutifully struggle the forty kilometres of
steep footpath from what passed for the nearest outpost of civilisation,
his purpose, apparently, to assert Nepal's ownership of the area.
Theoretically, the valley was also claimed by Tibet, but Tibet sent no
officials, as no route into the valley existed from the north, unless
you counted the laborious and temporary steps hacked in the high sheet
ice from time to time by the climbers' ice axes.

On maps, the valley had no name. It was just a crease in the edge of the
Himalayas. In the local tongue, it was traditionally called a phrase
meaning approximately "Flower of the Sun". Though it was uniquely benign
for its situation, it was not the comfortable environment implied by its
name. The cold of its 5000 metre altitude, the constant wind, the
relative shortage of oxygen and the lack of infrastructure saw to that.
But for a few, it provided a welcome alternative to living cheek by jowl
with the billions of human beings who infested all the more hospitable
corners of planet Earth in the late twenty-first century. And whenever
the sun shone, it tended to warm the whole area, winter and summer, and
snow melted quickly, except in shaded corners along the ragged southern
cliffs.

The valley was actually a tilted bowl, so that to enter it by the usual
method from the south, you had to climb up and over the lowest rim of
the bowl, to find the valley spread out below you. At some point in the
past, the valley had been completely filled by a lake. The lake had been
supplied from the melt waters above, and it had overflowed the southern
edge of the bowl, carving a watercourse that was now dry and formed the
main route into the valley. Some millennia ago, however, water had found
its way through a crack in the base of the bowl and drained away
through subterranean caves, to emerge through a fissure miles down the
track to Kathmandu When the lake emptied, it left a rich topsoil of
silt, in which grass and vegetables grew well. The crack was called "The
Throat of Shiva". The river now ran across the valley, and disappeared
down the Throat. The Throat was quite wide at the top, but it narrowed
about twenty metres down. When the river was at its lowest volume, a
climber could safely descend to see the flow gurgling through a 
circular hole a couple of metres in diameter. The hole was not wide
enough, though, because at the height of the springtime thaw, the volume
of glacial melt water backed up to form a pale blue lake some three to
five hundred metres in diameter, and a dangerous-looking whirlpool
appeared in the lake above the Throat. The houses that constituted the
village were situated a few kilometres upstream. Although the river
bisected the valley in a diagonal from northwest to southeast, part of
it near the village ran in a narrow gorge, and an ancient Bailey bridge,
dating from some military venture in the more than a century ago, joined
the halves of the valley.
 
<p class="drop">The appearance of a lean, tanned American walker with a
rucksack full of mysterious equipment and a command of various local
languages was not at first regarded as particularly remarkable. The area
was not unknown to naturalists and documentary film makers, due to its
unique ecosystem. The American based himself at Mona's inn, but often
camped in corners remote from the inn. His name, according to Mona, was
Frank.

Strangely, Frank spent several weeks hiking around the whole valley,
from the green lower slopes and pastures to the windswept crags, and
along every metre of the ice-melt river from its entry, high on the
mountainside, to its exit through the Throat near the southern raised
rim. He was observed to tinker with his shining apparatus and to inspect
rocks. He detonated a few small explosive charges. He sometimes talked
on his satellite telephone. He showed no immediate sign of leaving, but
declined to reveal his mission, and he became a fascinating puzzle to
everyone except Eric.

It wasn't that Eric knew what the American was up to. It was just that
he didn't at first find him fascinating. He seemed to know what Frank
was doing. Eric, a sun-dried, wiry Australian, had his own preoccupation
with his wind farm. Eric's first project, six or seven years ago, when
he had first retreated here from the unbearable overcrowding, water
shortage and stark dry heat of Western Australia, was to supply the
village with running water. It had been a simple piping job from the
engineering point of view, and saved everyone the tricky, and often
hazardous, business of fetching water from the river in buckets. Getting
the supplies of piping and valves had been more difficult, and he had to
persuade Vinod and his train of sure-footed donkeys to add the materials
to his load from the nearest town.

The water project was followed by a largely unsuccessful, or, rather,
strictly seasonal, solar heating project assembled from plastic tubing.
Since then, it had become his self-imposed mission to provide
electricity for the cluster of homes in the village. His windmills were
mounted on rock cairns along the highest part of the southern crags.
They consisted of old motor car generators with vanes attached. There
were billions of cars in the world when commercially available fuel
became too rare and expensive to be practical. Most of the cars were
still around, used as shelters, chicken coops, storage facilities, and
so on. None of them needed their alternators any more, so
alternators weren't hard to get hold of, even in Nepal. Eric's
experiments with rigid propellers on his first dynamo proved that when
wind varied between storm force and hurricane force, which it frequently
did up here, a rigid structure would bend or blow over. Now he used
plastic tubing for the ribs of the vanes, with triangular sheets of
synthetic fabric as the sails, whose pitch and size he could vary by a
clever arrangement of rope tethers. They resembled the traditional Greek
windmill. The ribs flexed in high winds, reducing the sail area and
relieving pressure. In extremis, if a rope gave way or a sail tore, all
the other tethers on the windmill would let go without damaging the
machinery. Now that he had more than a dozen windmills, however, it was
a near full-time job to service them all when the winds were high. There
was seldom a time when the air on the ridge was still, so power cuts
were rare. His main problem had been cable from the generators to the
village, until Vinod returned from a trip down the pass with a couple of
reels of Vietnamese electric cable that didn't meet even the lowest
quality standard permitted by the Nepalese hydroelectric company, but
which was super-adequate for Eric's purposes. A few heavy accumulators,
a box of Argentinian electronic dc-ac voltage boosters and Eric was
supplying 240 volts AC to his customers. As with most things in the
village, most commerce was based on barter, favour and obligation. In
Eric's words: "No-one eats idle bread".

The fertile valley had always supported many more sheep and goats than
were necessary for the valley's population. In these days, when most of
the world lived on vat-grown yeast products, real meat had become a
valuable commodity. Meat was the valley's main product, and its main
employer. Driving the animals to market had proved inefficient, because
they tended to become emaciated or to die of exhaustion or to meet with
accidents on the rocky path to civilisation. An attempt to bring a yak
to the valley failed when it proved unable to get through an extended
narrow defile on the path. For some years now, Vinod's donkey caravan
had taken sheep and goat carcasses to the market in the nearest town and
returned with fuel, sometimes wood, but more usually expensive biofuel,
along with flour and other dry goods. The lack of trees, and, therefore,
fuel, in the valley accounted for the fact that it had not historically
supported a large population.

Now, with electricity available, the need for calorific fuel was much
reduced, and there was capacity on the returning donkey train for Eric's
electrical supplies and for the villagers' modest electrical appliances.
According to Mona, Frank the American was surprised and pleased to be
able to recharge the batteries for his equipment at the inn.

When Eric was forced by Mona to speculate on  Frank's activities, all he
said was "Sounds like oil prospectin' to me. No oil up here, though.
He's wastin' his time. Oil's so valuable they'll try anywhere." Eric was
wrong, as it turned out.

It was, of course, Mona who found out what Frank the American was really
up to. It started quietly enough when she entertained him to a mutton
stew dinner washed down with potato wine that she made from the potatoes
she grew in the vegetable garden nearby. When Eric had first tasted the
wine, he had remarked that in his opinion, it "didn't travel", but Frank
seemed to enjoy it. Mona, who purported to be German, was a rich brown
in colour, and generously built, on the curvaceous side of plump.
Sitting opposite Frank, she leaned forward, parking her bosom on the
table like a bowl of fruit, and treating him to her most adoring gaze
and her warmest smile.

"Why do you call this place Starbucks?" Frank asked, when he seemed to
realise he'd been staring.

"Well, Vinod found the sign somewhere, and brought it back for me. We're
not exactly franchised, ha, ha, but it's the closest you'll get for a
hundred kilometres around here. You want coffee? We even had a bottle of
Coca Cola at one point, but it's gone, I'm afraid."

"No. The wine's fine. Great."

"Have some more. Whereabouts do you come from, Francis?"

"Southern Carolina, originally. Near Myrtle Beach. The reclaimed
offshore bit that links to the islands. Educated in Alaska, though, so
I'm used to the cold."

"What was your major, then?"

"Geological physics."

"Cool. I bet you've had some really interesting jobs." 

"Yeah, mostly land reclamation for building or cultivation."

"Really? Fascinating!" And so on, until the potato wine, the flattery
and Mona's physical charms tempted Frank to confide to her that his
current survey was on behalf of the "space cannon" project.

"But, Mona, this is just for you. Not a word to anyone." 

Mona was none the wiser. Space cannon? Wtf? "Sure, Frank. Have some more
wine."

Frank clammed up after that, and then fell asleep. Mona, of course, told
everyone the news, swearing them to secrecy, and by the following day,
Frank was the only person in the valley who didn't know he'd spilled the
beans to her. Due to potato wine amnesia, Frank's memory of the evening
was a warm, fuzzy blank. Only Eric had any clue what a space cannon was
and he said nothing, but, unusually, he accompanied Vinod on his next
trip to town, leaving the wind farm to its own devices for a week. Eric
returned with a new fat data plug for his j-pad and a thoughtful look on
his face.

It should be noted here that Eric's gimcrack windmills were not entirely
original. Kunchen was their intellectual progenitor. Kunchen was one of
the few inhabitants of the valley who, theoretically, "ate idle bread",
to use Eric's expression. A fugitive from a Tibet which no longer
revered the religion of his ancestors, Kunchen had already set up his
wind-powered prayer wheels and prayer cylinders on the southern ridge
long before Eric arrived. Kunchen now split his time between meditative
chanting and unsolicited advice. He regarded Eric's windmills with
suspicion, but approved of the design. He wondered aloud when Eric was
going to write some prayers on the sails of his machines until Eric gave
him permission to write his own, which he did. And, in the event,
Kunchen ever after insisted that these prayers were instrumental in how
things turned out.

<div class=pullquote>Vinod would make an immediate trip to petition the
Nepalese authorities</div>In due course, as the first cruel horizontal
rains
of autumn began,
Frank left, and, for a while, things went on as they always had. It was
an almost Marxist society - "to each, according to his need; from each,
according to his ability", but actual money did change hands,
principally for trade with the outside world. No-one in the valley went
hungry. The richest people in the valley were David Lee, Vinod, and the
sheep herders. The poorest were those who had migrated to the valley,
but had no contribution to make yet. This year's immigrants were three
in number, of whom only one was a failure. Jean-Paul, a French climber
who had stayed after his expedition left, made furniture from unlikely
scraps of material and did general repairs. David Lee was from Greater
Hong Kong. By that time, so much reclamation had taken place in the hub
of Asian trade that you could walk from Hong Kong island to mainland
Kowloon without getting your feet wet. David had established a sort of
savings and loan organisation which helped to even out the peaks and
troughs in the valley's income and expenditure. David was running at a
loss, but he didn't seem to mind. It was rumoured that he was an
eccentric millionaire with illegal businesses in Hong Kong. The third
immigrant, Anil, was preparing to return to the insanely jam-packed high
rises of Hyderabad before winter set in. He couldn't take the cold, he
missed the constant physical contact with fellow human beings, and he
had never really fitted in.

Winter passed relatively quietly. The January gales enabled Eric's wind
farm to reach a new high in power output, with fewer failures than ever
before. Snowfall was fairly light and never much of an inconvenience.
The river never once froze over. Vinod managed two return journeys to
town as early as March.

<p class=drop>First of April - no joke - an old twin-rotor Samson class
ex-military helicopter laboured over the southern rim of the bowl. A
massive machine, it could carry over two hundred tons of freight, though
the thin air obviously gave it trouble. It landed in a meadow of rough
grass and clover, just upstream of Mona's, on the north bank of the
river, its tail wheel carelessly crushing a pregnant ewe which had been
so paralysed with fear that she failed to run away when the flying
monster appeared.

The crew unloaded a dozen heavy crates, several oil-drums and a
mechanical digger. The helicopter roared and whacked its way back
southwards, but eleven men were left behind. The crates contained
pre-fabricated living quarters, generators, furniture, provisions and
office equipment. The drums contained fuel. An unbelievable amount of
fuel.

The new arrivals had set up two prefabricated buildings, a generator,
and a satellite dish, surrounded by a high fence, before Mona's
curiosity overcame her irritation at not being formally approached by
the gang. She crossed the bridge and walked the three hundred metres to
their compound, offering food and drink as an ice-breaker, but they
politely informed her in American English that they were
self-sufficient. They needed nothing. They gave her no explanation of
their intentions, but showed her a document in Chinese which they said
conferred upon them licence to drill north of the river. As de-facto
spokesman for the valley, Mona demanded and received a photocopy of the
document.

Later, Gulam, an important sheep owner, whose sheep the helicopter had
crushed and in whose spring meadow the Americans were setting up their
operation, barged into the office hut and complained to them. When they
understood what he was complaining about, they gave him a metal suitcase
containing Chinese currency worth sixty thousand dollars, and left him
standing while they got on with their mysterious work. David Lee was
astonished at the size of the sum Gulam deposited with him.

The same day, at a hastily arranged noisy multi-lingual conference in
Mona's inn, the inhabitants of the valley expressed their fear of this
development.

When it was Eric's turn to speak, he said: "I've been expecting this
ever since Frank was here. I was hoping that the terrain would be
unsuitable, or that the Nepalese administration would kill the idea."

David spoke up: "What idea?"

"Remember Frank and his space cannon survey last year? I investigated
these space cannons when I went to town. It's a cheap method of sending
bulk materials into orbit, anything that can take a brutal acceleration.
It costs a fraction of lifting them by rocket. They just shoot
containers from a cannon that faces east and is at high altitude, to
take advantage of the earth's rotation and the low atmospheric pressure.
A spacecraft intercepts the projectile and delivers it to where it's
needed."

"A cannon?" said Vinod. "A big gun?" 

"Yeah, well, the barrel of the gun is sunk a few kilometres into solid
rock, and only the muzzle appears above ground. Then there's the
elevator mechanism to take the payload and the ammunition down to the
loading end."

"That's not too bad, then, once it's finished." said David. "Apart from
the noise, of course."

Eric looked sad. "The noise is the least of it. Yes, it's going to be a
deafening explosion several times a day. And don't forget the constant
shuttle service of helicopters. But that's not the only reason why they
are built in uninhabited areas. The gun is powered by a small atomic
explosion, and the area around the muzzle becomes contaminated very
quickly."

"How big an area?" asked Mona.

"The one in the Andes has made a radio-active slick thirty kilometres
long and ten wide. When this cannon gets going, the valley will be
uninhabitable apart from the loading crews in shielded accommodation.
That's why this area is ideal for them. It's isolated, and there aren't
a lot of us to complain about being moved."

"So the only hope is to stop the building." said Mona.

"You got it." said Eric, rubbing his chin and looking grim.

There was lots more discussion, to no particular effect, except that it
was agreed that Vinod would make an immediate trip to petition the
Nepalese authorities to sort out this outrage. Vinod took with him the
photocopy of the licence (which David had read, but whose authenticity
he could not verify) and a shopping list from Eric. The round trip was
scheduled to take at least a week. In the event, he didn't return for a
month.

<div class=pullquote>The village electricity supply was cut
off, though the windmills still twinkled on the ridge.</div> Meanwhile,
the
helicopter supply trips to the site became a twice-daily
occurrence. More men and equipment arrived. The men working on the job
started to patronise Mona's. The project manager, Billy Macdonald, a
veteran of the Bering Strait tunnel in Alaska, was friendly enough, and
appeared sympathetic with the valley dwellers. David Lee and Eric bribed
one of the helicopter pilots to add a load of copper piping to one of
his trips. Mona was mystified. What use was an additional water supply
when they'd all be leaving soon? David clearly was prepared to fund
Eric's operation, however. 

Vinod eventually returned with Ashwali from Kathmandu. Sadly, explained
the official, the licence document issued by the Chinese government was
entirely valid, and had been sanctioned by Nepal in exchange for certain
trade advantages. In fact, satellite imaging and treaty borders
demonstrated that all of the land north of the river had always been
part of the province of Tibet. Only the lower part of the bowl was
actually Nepalese territory.

Eric remained very busy for the whole of this time. While everyone else
was letting things slide at the prospect of having to leave this lovely
haven within a year or two, Eric appeared more energetic than ever. He
became thinner and stronger. He worked long hours, frequently arriving
late at Mona's, dirty, often soaked to the skin, and sometimes covered
in scratches and grazes as if he'd been climbing. He spent a lot of time
in his workshop joining sections of pipe in strange configurations. He
started scrounging old clothes and any kind of heavy grease, mostly
mutton fat from the shepherds. He also "borrowed" a cylinder of butane
from Mona, who sometimes cooked with gas. What Eric was actually
planning, though, he would not reveal.

As the spring melt began in the mountains, the river started to back up
and form a small lake around the Throat as usual. But this year, it
didn't drain away. The lake kept growing. Jean-Paul built a few
temporary shelters on high ground, and Mona's inn moved uphill, together
with all the villagers. Work on the tunnel for the cannon barrel, now,
inevitably, an open secret, had to stop, as the tunnel and then the
prefabricated buildings on the site became flooded. The cannon workers
were forced to evacuate all their equipment, fuel and stores to higher
ground. And still the water rose. The village electricity supply was cut
off, though the windmills still twinkled on the ridge.

Billy Macdonald, seeing his project slowing to a standstill, came to
visit Mona at her makeshift café. "Is this unusual?" he asked. He didn't
have to explain what "this" was.

"It floods every year." said Mona. "But this is the worst I've seen it."

"When does it go down?"

Mona was not encouraging. "Couple of months, usually. It doesn't
normally concern us, because it's not remotely this bad."

Macdonald also consulted Eric, who was mending a wind turbine on the
southern cliff. To get there, he had to make a wide detour around the
lake and climb several hundred feet. "What do you reckon, Eric?"

"In my opinion," Eric replied, "the Throat of Shiva is partially
blocked. At this rate, the lake will fill until the water level reaches
the southern pass and it spills out down the trail to Kathmandu. But by
that time, the whole valley will be one big lake."

"We could drill a relief tunnel through the rim, maybe. Take the water
away."

"You know as well as I do that by the time you finish that, the lake
will be too big to handle. Wherever you decide to build the relief
tunnel it would have to be above the current level of the lake, and the
lake is already too high for your gun. Nope. You'd better get your
bosses on the blower, and advise them to cut their losses. You must have
an alternative site. It's just unfortunate geology. Something's shifted
down in the tunnel under the Throat. We'll all be out of the valley by
the end of the year, anyway, if the lake keeps growing. And I don't know
if you've noticed, but you can often see the lake steaming in the
mornings, just above where the Throat is. In my opinion, there's
volcanic activity down there. Cut and run is my advice."

Billy Macdonald didn't take anyone's word for it. Divers were flown in,
and, though underwater visibility was extremely limited due to the milky
suspension of ground-up rock from the glacier, they could verify that
flow through the Throat appeared to have ceased, and that there was, on
the contrary, a current of warm water coming  up, a clear indication of
volcanic activity below. It was obvious that, even if the flood could be
dealt with, it would be foolhardy to mount a space cannon in an area
where earthquakes were a possibility.

In early August, the last workers left the space cannon site. By the end
of September, the lake had disappeared. The temporary inconvenience of
the flood was more than compensated for by the huge volume of supplies,
fuel and building materials the tunnellers had abandoned.

Kunchen attributed the miracle to his ancestors. Somehow, however,
everyone else knew that Eric was behind the miracle, but he only creased
his face in a grin when he was asked about it. Only David was ever told
the truth.

<p class=drop>One evening, Eric and David sat in the setting sun,
braving an energetic
horizontal fall of sleet in the lee of Mona's inn, having drunk an
incautious quantity of Chateau Potato. From inside, they could hear Mona
and Jean-Paul laughing together and four herders quarrelling happily
over their incomprehensible card game while downing cups of buttered
tea. The sound of sheep bells drifted in the breeze as a flock, dimly
visible on the upper slopes, settled for the night. David suddenly
asked: "How did you do it, Eric?"

"Blocked the Throat with ice."

"Ice? Where did you get it?"

"Made it."

"But they said it was hot down there, not cold"

"Heat pump, David. It's old technology. Electric pump, submersible in
this case, tubes, the stuff we got from the chopper pilot. Basically,
it's how refrigerators work. You pump heat from one part of the system
to another. The pipes have butane in them. When I could still get down
into the Throat, I climbed down and shoved the freezer coils into the
vent. The heating coils were buried in the ground near the Throat before
the lake started. All you could see even before the flood was a couple
of pipes going down, and I hid them as best as I could in the cracks.
Once the lake was there, you couldn't see a thing. Set the pump going,
and a block of ice formed in the vent. What I didn't reckon on at the
time was that the heating coils would produce enough heat to give the
volcanic effect. The main problem was all the electricity and insulation
under the water. I had to make my own Denso tape with rags and mutton
fat. And it took a week or more to form the plug, even though it only
had to cool the water by a few degrees of temperature. And when the wind
dropped halfway through, and I had to go to battery power, the pump
nearly stopped."

"So how did you clear the ice?"

"Put the heat pump in reverse. They work both ways. No problem there.
And I could block it again if we needed to."

The sun dipped below the western ridge, the sky blazed with colour and
the sleet slackened to a soft drizzle.

After a moment, David removed one of his sheepskin mittens, adjusted the
earflap of his hat, and said: "Nice here, isn't it?"

Eric permitted himself a grin. "Shangri-La, mate, Shangri ruddy La."

[*BLURB] A chilling route to self-development.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Only when the first wound has healed, my
connection bedded in and resting heavy along my neck, can I begin. After
decades of disgust, scratching at itches, stretching and stiffness,
aching, or waking while dull extremities sleep on, with pleasure I force
the nails to break the skin and start to peel the arm. Blood wells and
runs, but cunning veins of nano-weave sip up and plug the dyke,
sustaining the rest as the first dripping sliver is discarded into the
pool. It was never wanted. It is no longer needed. My desire, fleshed
out at last. More quickly follows.</P>

<P>I stop when I can see a length of bone, giddy with pain and the
thrill of action too long desired and delayed, but to hesitate now would
mean disaster. I scoop a palm of the viscous fluid from its tank, smear
it across the grain, feel it cool and start to work, see furrows eat
towards the marrow beneath the glistening surface. In minutes gleaming
lines fill the scars, traversing the nerve gap; the fingers twitch
again, then clench a fist of victory. Teeth grind in a rare smile. Where
next? </P>

<P>I tear at meat and ligament until poor muscles fail me, satisfaction
tainted by the same old loathing. Gel-coated, I sleep beside the data
hub, patient in its steadily clouding pool, waking to tingling
sensations of numbed familiarity. My legs have become a skeletal
gun-metal parody, but my arm is now superb: a bending willow wrapped in
shining nerves, unreal flexibility, the joints of fingers, wrist and
elbow gliding together, just visible beneath the lacy mesh of my still
knitting graphene skin. I stilt-walk to the bathroom scales, half metal
and yet light, trailing my vital connection back towards the pool, the
hub.</P>

<P>I pee – will I ever pee again? Holding with the wrong hand, now made
suddenly so right, the flesh responds in its mechanical way for the
first time in years, unexpectedly stimulated by my alien touch. I lurch
back to the interface to open a new field, preserving the data as I
strike off another last. </P>

<P>More genes for the pool. </P>

<P>More work to be done.</P>

<P>The day passes, until as old eyes take in the beauty of a sunset I
reach a point of surrender: this can no longer be a self-directed
revolution. My limbs are now remade, both legs perfected too, the last
arm in transition, but the delicacies of the core cannot be so roughly
sublimed. I have had revenge upon myself; it is time to passively await
reward. A last volition, to enter instructions, then submit to my own
command. Executed.</P>

<P>Coiling the connecting line about one arm, I follow it down into the
pool, sinking in to the deepest extent until the precious hub is cradled
in my hands. Looking up, the fluid surface is like a glowing screen. The
mouth opens to exhale, then breathes it in fully, eyes stinging only for
a moment, and then close.</P>

<P>Time for me to rest. </P>

<P>Time for me to rise.</P>

<P>Liquid flows away from me as I step from the pool. How much time has
passed? Soon I will know it to the millisecond. Opening these eyes for
the first time I admire my torso, touch the ribbed latticework flexing
around my supple spine. The old weakness and decay is gone, now I feel
photons cascade over my surface, radiating through me, invigorating. I
pose and arch, internalise my strange new genitals then extrude them
again. What shall I be today? What tomorrow? </P>

<P>This temple is complete. Joyful, I walk my body around my rooms,
leap, dance in a momentary rippling shiver. It can do anything now,
everything... except leave. Finally, there is nothing left to dispense
with but the meat of my thoughts, that muscle that flexes motionless to
move mountains without weight. My desire fleshed out at last, it is no
longer needed. It is a tether to my past, made concrete by the
connection. Until that last shred is torn away, my dreams remain caged
within its folds, my new existence anchored to the old. All trace must
be destroyed if I am ever to be free.</P>

<P>Within my head resides the data hub, a new seat for consciousness,
waiting virginal. Within the tank resides... the last of my old life. I
sit before the glass, study the decrepit folded matter floating beyond
my smooth reflection, seeing it with an unnatural clarity, unappreciated
by mere technology. I work my hands upon the clumsy interface with sweet
grace, and beside my perception an unseen gate is cast wide open. My
thoughts flood their banks, pour across the interface and are soaked up
into a dense void, like thick honey into a heated comb, running faster
there, ever faster, and through the interface I sense my own thoughts
come spiking back across at me, greedily triggering habit and experience
to make the cognitive leap as well. Feeding the data hub, defining it.
Defining me.</P>

<P>Emotions follow. My glorious face smiles.</P>

<P>As the echoing of personality harmonises, we realise success. Is it
that frail suspended greyness or this finely sparkling network which
leads in our closing duet? Reaching up towards our head with gentle
hands we break the connection – and instantly all sight and duality are
lost to a timeless null. I am left afloat, alone. It was always my fate,
there was never a true escape from the cage.</P>

<P>Soon I will free myself. Soon my golden fingers will dip into this
pool and show me mercy. I will touch these old places, the poor
abandoned home in which I still reside, where I was born to die, and I
will be borne away. Will I know when it begins? They say the brain
itself can feel no pain. </P>

<P>No matter. It is know longueur kneaded</P>

<p class="drop">Going for the cut today.
Fucking terrified.
Gabriel’s got a new cutter setup in his basement, painstakingly
assembled from gomied landfill and parts bought off a Chinese ebay
clone. I’m the guinea pig and I’m shitting it. I can take the pain
(morphine analogues nicked from Mum – <i>de nada</i>) but the bit that
terrifies me is the damage (de-gloving, *shudder*) and the nudity. Not
just the bare surface exposure, but the denuded lack, the comfort
blanket removal that filled me with a lunar dread. No more wazoo
bandwidth netlink, no more Shiny Things&#8482;&nbsp;one-click
consumerism,
no more toggle wanks. There’s an upside though: geoloc nixed and going
dark, the rasp of newly laundered towel on my back, the snap of snaps,
the heft of hand woven broadcloth on my shoulders, the first stubborn
tug of denim over my hips. The real skin awaits.</P> 

<P><B><small>&lt;anonpost. general&nbsp;broadcast | backchannel. DATESTAMP: 21:22.11.12.47&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">As normal, the tube was late, the TerrorHurtz mid-tunnel
scanners were always going on the fritz and the alert was pegged at
Severe; this meant that the tube door secondary gait scanners were being
extra-anal. As I entered the carriage I got a non-friendly spine tingle
B-Aware ping; like all I’m going to do if I see a unattended package is
huddle as close to it as possible – I cleave to the
red-mist-is-better-than-triple-amputee mindset. I sub-vocalised a
fuck-you at the monitoring child-AI but nothing got as far as my lips –
I may be a dissenter but I’m not a moron.</P> <P>Gabriel’s lockup was in
the old Olympic village and crowd density in the carriage was light. At
this time of night most people are Westbound, heading to central update
zones for mandatory Skin upgrades; you can dodge a few of these a month
but Wednesday attendance was good form, a school night schlep across
town sent good vibes to Whitehall. I shared the ageing, rattling
carriage with only three others. A weary Bangladeshi med-tech out of St.
Thomas’s; he was leaning into the foetid, faux wind at the carriage
interstices, maybe remembering a surgeon’s career in Dhaka. The other
two were interchangeable fifth-gen emo clones; sharing both a smokeless
pipe and earphones – they’ll miss their stop, enjoy, Epping
douchebags.</P>

<p class="drop">Stratford was delightful as always. I tried to turn left
out of the station but my Skin forced an executive left into Great
Eastern Road, tripling my walk time to Gabriel’s. There’s no way of
knowing if I had just dodged a dirty bomb particulate cloud or if I was
a tiny part of an evacuation modelling exercise, either way it was a
ball ache. It was nearly 2300 by the time I got to the Village. The
place was grebby as always, shuffling late night shoppers slurping down
street noodles and I turned down five Clipper sellers in as many
minutes. The faded, transitory glory in the Village was nearly as bad as
the O2 Arena. Nearly. Eleven billion in old money buys some permanence
but the hectare of previously pretty water park was now a sallow, grim
bog and previously artful poly sun canopies were shredded into
moth-eaten pterodactyl wings that snapped and fluttered in the harsh
December wind that scooted off the Lea Valley marsh.</P> <P>Gabriel’s
lock up was an old storage space in what was originally the Estonian
section of the athletes’ accommodation. Thirty cubic metres lined with
grey, fist-pocked plasterboard was my operating theatre for the night.
The roller door death rattled up on under-lubed tracks and Gabriel
greeted me with his standard blanked face.</P>

<p class="drop">Social historians looking back at the middle of 21C will
perhaps be puzzled by the predominance of starkly non-expressive faces
in
images or video captured in public places.&nbsp;As surveillance
saturation increased from the early 2010s onwards,&nbsp;fuelled&nbsp;by
ever more granular taxing methods and notional terrorism threats, the
general
populace evolved means of reducing their biometric footprint. Gait
modification trusses were at first home-brewed and then Chinese
mass-produced. After hoodies were outlawed, grass roots lecture sessions
on
how to fool facial recognition software grew in popularity, and sign
language jumped the gap from prosthesis to <i>de facto</i> language.
Stegging
became a part of life; we all now ostensibly fulfil the criteria of
optimal citizenry but our visible surfaces are merely a veneer of
adherence to an increasingly arbitrary and hard-to-follow set of
state-mandated&nbsp;behavioural&nbsp;norms.</P> <P>Late in the 30s the
government lost patience with an increasingly wily public and on January
1<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;2040 the Non-optional Monitoring Garb bill was
passed by the incumbent coalition. Stripped of its weasel verbiage and
hand-wringing justification it meant that anyone over the age of
fourteen
was medically fitted with a permanently derma-bonded synthetic skin. The
Skin, as it swiftly became known, could impose any number of centrally
controlled directives and what were euphemistically
called&nbsp;<I>suggestions</I>. The well-planned PR drive that coincided
with the passing of the NMG bill heavily publicised the ostensible
benefits
of such a solution: medical monitoring became the norm (but let’s forget
that waiting lists didn’t get any shorter), voting was instantly polled
via willed electro-dermal response, and crowd control measures could be
imposed with flocking algorithms (no crush injuries...&nbsp;allegedly).
The reality, of course, was different: mandatory curfews, real-time
polygraphic feedback, house arrest with dietary modifiers, tingle
impellers (so called below-pain-threshold behaviour suggestives), and
there was the inevitable commercial wrapper. It didn’t take long
for the Ministry of Justice to realise that a sizeable chunk of
the&nbsp;hallucinogenically&nbsp;large budget deficit could be offset by
selling their captive audience. Spam took on a completely different spin
when delivered in the form of a blood sugar mod that forced a need
for certain endorphin-laced soft drinks and it was suspected that a
pandemic
of&nbsp;excruciating&nbsp;photophobic migraine (and its subsequent
expensive remedy) were the result of similar electrochemical
tinkering.</P> <P>The grass roots response to Skin didn’t take long to
manifest itself. The Cutters broadcast their first Cut on Facebook on
April
1<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;2040. Sofia Bibi became the dissenters’ heroine
overnight. Rejecting analgesia and chewing nearly all the way through a
wooden spoon handle in her agony, Sofia endured the ministrations of a
hacked car assembly line robot as it systematically and precisely sliced
through the Skin (and, blithely, her own hide) and shucked her like a
bloody pea. She lived for four days and died coddled in a rough shawl of
home-spun wool. Her
last, croaked words created a slogan for all future
Cutters, &quot;It’s just skin deep, fuckers&quot;.</P> <P>Gabriel was
part of the East London Cutter cell. The Cutting tech has happily
plateaued at a level that means the pain is manageable and survival is
(mostly) guaranteed, but the equipment is deliberately hobbled to ensure
that post-operative healing is imperfect. Cutters want the scarring, it
is a sign
that&nbsp;<I>process</I>&nbsp;was endured. In a world where
almost all sensation, feeling, pain, suffering could be mediated and
ameliorated by the Skin, it became critical to the Cutter movement
that participants suffer for their emancipation. The white heat pain of
the industrial laser scarifying the base level skin is like a re-birth
to the Cutters, self-harm elevated to near-transcendence. There is a
practical downside to Cutting though; as Skin offered an almost perfect
protection against the elements, clothing became relegated to decorative
function, semi-disposable over-garments of questionable EPZ provenance
only partially masking the faux skin tones (five taupe-through-chocolate
shades) of the semi-matt appearance of Skin. Post-Cutting, nudity became
an issue again; proper clothing became a badge of honour amongst the
Cutter cells, with countless cottage industry producing, initially at
least, crude hand woven clothing that nourished a tactility need but
offered little in the way of nuanced tailoring. The holed, ragged
aesthetic satisfied some Cutters who riffed off historical
post-apocalyptical fantasies but for the most part they looked to the
deeper past
for inspiration.</P> <P>The first Cutter shuttle loom in London was
built in 2045 by Gabriel’s Southern cell; operating out of a basement in
a
disused Nando's in Camberwell; this heaving contraption looked like a
Heath Robinson sketch crossed with a miltech medical robot. The first
cloth to come off the loom was a gleaming copper fabric, painstaking
warped from hand-unravelled electrical cable. The Cutters had learned
that the chance of a successful Cutting was greatly enhanced by first
offlining the Skin before the operation. As all Skin was netlinked in
numerous ways, it made a lot of sense to EM shield the patient. This
first cloth-of-gold from the loom formed the basis for a crude but
effective Faraday cage that festooned the Nando's basement with a NASAed
bling.</P>

<p class="drop">Gabriel’s new rig was very different from the jointed,
articulated octopi that most Cutter cells use. A columnar structure
about 2.5 meters high with a central space just big enough for a person,
close up it looked a little like a highly magnified section of squid
tentacle, with countless very sharp hooks aligned in an endless
spiroform. Later I find out that he took inspiration from ancient
loopwheeler tech, a 20C weaving machine that outputted a seamless torso
garment. Instead of circularly weaving a continuous fabric Gabriel’s
machine does the opposite, each nanonically sharp hook of the Cutter
unweaves a section of Skin, close to the cellular level. Homebuilt tech
is never perfect though and this is why I am busying popping pills and
slapping patches as I shucked my outer tunic. The Skin does not transmit
derma drug patches though so I am forced to apply the morphine analogue
pernineally, not a good look between mates…</P> <P>Gabriel says very
little, there is a little he can offer as solace, he knows it’ll fucking
hurt but he does nod to the neat pile of denim and wool that sits on a
metal folding chair in the corner of the lockup. This is the payoff for
Cutters, the reward for denuding ourselves of cold modern comforts. I
spied the faint striations of loom-woven selvedge denim and the sea
foam bulges of Scottish wool and felt an absurdly childish excitement,
even the boxer shorts on top of the pile seem desperately exotic, with
hand stitched buttons on the crotch placket. Not that I will be able to
wear my new clothes for at least a week, even with black market
re-epithelialisation drugs, I will be a walking, screaming scab for days
to come. Repulsively it will be my own flayed Skin that will remain my
primary garment for the initial healing phase, it will offer the best
protection and least chance for opportunistic infection; I will drag it
on, weeping, like the worst wet bathing costume ever.</P>

<p class="drop">Jonty was braver than most. He shucked his Primarni
eight quid tunic and then only hesitated briefly before climbing into
the cutter on his hands and knees. He snagged his Skin on a lower part
of the chassis, a crappy weld I remember promising myself I'd dremel off
and never did, scoring a painless weld on his shoulder. Under the harsh
sodiums the Skin disappointed me as it always does. Despite the profound
amount of technology crammed (nano-wise and micro-ways) into its 6 mm
dermis, it screamed Gov issue drab; they never did pin down the
self-cleaning routines and dirt that wont wash away
was&nbsp;tattooed&nbsp;into the gross creases under his shoulder blades
and elbows. As he crawled under the lowest excision coil I had to look
away as he exposed his&nbsp;partially&nbsp;seamed&nbsp;faecal&nbsp;flap
and hairless genital pouch, blandly faux skin-pink and curiously more
naked than banal dangling testes would have been. God. Help. Us. He
negotiated the shimmering, hyper-scalpelled edges of the cutting surface
and stood upright, assuming the prescribed Vitruvian pose. He threw me a
terrified affirmative and I threw the knife switch. The current spiked,
the sodiums dimmed to red and I skinned him.</P>

<p class="drop">I stroked his hair, his real hair. He was asleep at
last; the seventh patch had at last taken the edge off the agony. He lay
on the rug in the front room, a wheezing comma, like he had on winter
evenings when he was a kidder, tired out from footy. He takes up more
room now, and I can't ignore the scabrous black-red stain that has
obliterated the awful floral pattern of the carpet. His escape wardrobe
is still piled neatly by the living room door where he dumped it when he
got back. The front door had slammed open in the small hours, he had
shambled in, swayed up the hallway, scaring me half to death - coal
black eyes had stared out of a red Noh mask, a nightmare made dream; but
I had been ready. </P> <P>I get up to tidy his precious clothes, thick
denim digging comfortingly into the backs of my knees. I used the chair
to spare my spine and as I got up I looked down at my hands, at my own,
older, scars – a silver tracery mapping out a new future for us
both.</P>
