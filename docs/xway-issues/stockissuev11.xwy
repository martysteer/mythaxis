[*COMMENT] Issue 11 - December 2012

[*ITEM] Editorial

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] Welcome to the August 2012 edition of Mythaxis.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>This, the eleventh issue of the magazine,
contains the greatest number of stories we have so far published in a single issue.

Part of this is due to me publishing five of Les Sklaroff's short pieces in
one issue.
They are light, short, and entertaining. Do not miss them..

Andrew Leon Hudson presents us with a headache, or, should I say 'Nightmare'?

Martin Clark also has two stories in this edition - quite different stories,
both excellent.

It's a while since we were treated to one of Tom Davies' Pasha Rapley stories, so
hold on to your hats for this one. 

New contributor John Frochio gives us this 300 word story which encompasses a
subtle plot.

I'm also publishing another in the Emigration series from Liam Baldwin.

An irritation has arisen with Internet Explorer, which was causing recent index pages
to display wrongly. I believe I have fixed it. Please let me know if there's a problem on
any platform.

Below, I write in memory of the punched card.

<hr>

<img src="punchcard.jpg">
<p class=drop>My theme today, following my nostalgia for slide rules 
in our previous issue, is the punched card. Like the slide rule, punched cards, as
a data storage device, had a long innings. Disregarding pioneering uses, both were
relatively commonplace from the 19th century until the 1980s, when they both
basically disappeared. They disappeared for the same reason. Technology replaced them.
I cannot, offhand, find a future sf story that features punched cards, but I
know they seemed to be a permanent feature of computing.
The cards in the image are the only cards I have left. I used to have stacks of them, as they were
also useful for notes, shopping lists, propping up jiggly restaurant tables and so on.

Though they vanished very suddenly, punched cards had an Indian Summer as data storage devices for the computers
of the 1950s and 1960s. As a programmer in the mid-1960s, when input data and software
were almost universally stored on punched cards, it was hard to believe they 
would ever be superseded. Public utilities, banks, industrial firms, insurance companies, 
hospitals - any large concern who could afford a £100000+ computer - had 
"Data Preparation" departments, staffed by scores of staff who
spent eight hours a day transferring handwritten input forms and computer programs
onto punched cards. One of the most common sights in a business in those days
were dozens of trays of punched cards, each tray containing up to 2000 cards. 

Most people have only seen the commonest variety - the 80 column punch card as used by
the majority of computer manufacturers - 
which was the same 
size as the big orange one in the image above, but the orange one is, in fact, a Powers Samas 65 column 
card which used round holes, not the more conventional rectangular ones.
<P>The little pink one is a 21 column Powers card, intended to be 2 sets of 10 columns, counting from
left to right and right to left, and a control column in the middle. Weird.
<P>The two long thin ones are a 36-column Powers card and a 40 column ICT. 
<P>The pale square one is an IBM 96 column card (3 rows of 32) - used, I think, on the System 38 computer family.
<P>The cut-off corners were to ensure that every card in a pack was facing the same way.

Many disasters arose from the accidental spilling of packs of cards, as their sequence, as well as 
their orientation, was usually critical. I once dropped a pack when entering a lift,
and a few cards fell down the slot between the floor and the car. I not only had to put them back in order,
I had to figure out which ones had disappeared and get them re-punched.
 
You also had to learn how to put the card pack into any given card reader, as they all
varied, like today's chip and pin machines. I still remember the ICL 900 card per minute reader,
(face down, 9 edge leading). That machine read, as you will easily calculate, 15 cards
per second, and it really had to move them quickly over the single column read head.
The result was that for part of the time, each card was actually airborne, and woe betide you if it 
was even slightly bent, as aerodynamics would turn it sideways, and it would get stuck crosswise 
in the channel, and within one second, the following 15 
cards would have hurtled into it before the automatic error tripped or you hit the stop switch.
Then it was a question of trying to get the cards back in order, repunch any bent or torn ones and start again.
It was nerve-racking enough at 900 cards a minute to keep the input hopper full and to empty the output.
<P>The only card I ever learned to read by eye was the standard 80 column card. 
I could also punch cards on a hand punch. It became quite common for
good programmers to hand-punch a program straight onto cards, and get a hard copy of them
by running them through a print program. 

Occasionally, card surgery
was attempted. When punching cards, a by-product was the pile of little rectangular chips
of cardboard that the punch cut out of the card. These were called "chad". If there was a single 
column error on an 80 column card, you could push pieces of chad back into the holes that were wrong
- they fitted quite well - and re-punch that column - a great time-saver in the middle of the night, 
otherwise you
would have to re-punch the whole 80 columns on a new card (which, of course, was what you OUGHT to
have done). Unfortunately, the next time that pack of cards was 
riffled (as
you had to do before the pack was put in a card reader) the chad was likely to fall out, and cause a error
which might take hours to find. Wildcat card surgery became such a problem in some companies 
that hand punches were
banned, but most programmers had one hidden in the back of a filing cabinet, just in case.

Happy days, eh?

[*ITEM] The Smile of Paeony 3rdfield

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] <I>Acacia albida</I> owners - BEWARE.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The first one to be filmed (to use the
archaic term) was spotted at dawn by a roving reconnaissance pod over
Ratman’s Fork, a desolate spot where the rough edge of urban sprawl gave
way to the broken shells of long-abandoned warehouses.  The route of the
old motorway was still just detectable under the accretion of brambles,
weeds, hardy grasses and the detritus of ancient wreckage.  The images
were automatically filed at Central, but left unprocessed for some sixty
days.  Ratman’s Fork was not listed among priority scanning zones.</P>
<P>Weeks passed before another one was detected, this time in the early
afternoon, amid the affluent parkland on the outskirts of Snoak City,
where Paeony 3rdfield, jauntily buoyant after a late light breakfast of
joyflakes, was walking Topaz and Chartreuse, her stylishly expensive
modifidos.  Along with all other nearby electronic devices, they
abruptly deactivated and, despite Paeony's optimistic pleading, remained
stubbornly inert.  She tried to summon the emergency service, then her
friends, and finally her parents, but her e-screen stayed blank.  </P>
<P>Reports of fused circuitry began filtering through to Central, where
a hologrid displayed the telltale 600-metre radius of malfunction, its
source apparently lodged in the crown of an <I>Acacia albida</I>,
imported generations ago from Malawi.  A dozen-strong team of Detechs
arrived in protective gear, armed with powerful spring-loaded
tranquilliser dartguns.  They ignored the forlorn Paeony and her
unmoving pets, and with swift precision positioned themselves
strategically around the tree.  Unfortunately they were too late; their
target had moved on.</P>
<P>At Central, over the next few months, analysts sifted through a spate
of reported sightings and dead-zone instances, for the most part in
thinly populated areas.  Allowing for nerdy hoaxes and sophisticated
criminal sabotage, there was an undeniable core of of genuine cases,
including the Ratman’s Fork images, which though belatedly discovered,
turned out to be invaluable.  These showed a fast-moving quadruped about
the same size as a domestic cat, and at first glance not dissimilar in
features, apart from markedly recessed eyes, and a kind of mesh above
its lipless mouth.  Closer scrutiny revealed it to be acaudate, covered
not with fur, but with chitinous or quasi-metallic scales, and having
two pairs of flexible segmented digits.  Combined with less distinct
images from other sources it was also seen to possess retractable
wings.</P>
<P>No specimen is known to have been caught, and the creature’s origin
is still speculative, as are its numbers, its social organisation, its
ability to communicate, and its reason for being here.  It has no niche
in any known terrestrial ecosystem.  If bioengineered, it is well in
advance of our current technology.  The characteristic damage caused to
electrically-powered systems, while inconvenient, is now believed to be
unintentional, and its preference for deserted areas may imply its
awareness of and attempts to minimise these effects.</P>
<P>Rumours still abound, some inevitably of the child-frightening
variety.  Is it controlled from elsewhere?  Is it a scout, an emissary,
a refugee, an accidental visitor?  Is there a vast undiscovered hive, a
lurking mothership, a secret rift in the space-time continuum?  We
simply do not know.  It will be interesting to find out, as no doubt we
will in due course.  Meanwhile at Central they are still puzzling about
the <I>Acacia albida </I>event, and continuing to search  for meaningful
patterns in the other confirmed appearances.  On the positive side, at
least Paeony 3rdfield can smile again.  She has been seen flaunting a
sumptuous pair of top-of the-range operatic paraparrots, following the
successful insurance claim on her defunct modifidos.

[*ITEM] Dundro Fappit's Mistake

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB]  Not to be confused with the Legend of <I>Red-beard and the
Chiming Bones</I>. Oh, no.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The natives of the Micronesian island of
Tao'kaua sometimes tell their children the legend of <I>The Jellyfish
Who Tried to Eat the Stars</I>.  It is one of many cautionary tales they
have up their sleeve to instil respect, discourage foolhardiness, and,
as a good friend of mine once eloquently put it, 'knock some of the
greth out of the little bastards.'  As a morally instructive example,
<I>The Jellyfish Who Tried to Eat the Stars</I> is about as effective as
<I>The Snake Who Lost the Moon</I>, or <I>The More and More Bird</I>.
As a result, the children of Tao'kaua tend to retain much of their
greth, and are obliged, like the rest of us, to learn from their own
mistakes.</P>
<P>One such mistake was made by Dundro Fappit, a native not of Tao'kaua,
of which hardly anyone has heard, but of Snoak City, half a world away.
For at least five generations Fappits had been makers of musical
instruments.  Back in the days of Tuddy and Larsha, Dundro's
great-great-grandparents, the family had provided bespoke instruments
for the leading musicians of the day, including the great Horum Pan and
the multi-talented Winivrel Flixx.  These days the clients were less
world-renowned, but no less demanding.</P>
<P>In the Fappit workshop, the sweet tang of freshly pared wood mingled
with sharp epoxy resin, steam, heated metal and varnish.  Partially
completed instruments were held in clamps, or supported by sturdy
armatures.  A multitude of specialised tools hung neatly from labelled
hooks on the walls.  Some were in use by apprentices under the close
supervision of Dundro's brothers, Rerp and Sullit.  Lathes purred and
buzzed, suction ducts whirred, preventing much of the sawdust and fine
shavings of maple, sycamore, ash and cherrywood from drifting to the
floor.  Behind the closed door of the adjoining office sat Dundro
Fappit, gazing dolefully at a slightly chipped pyramidal glass
paperweight on his paper-free desk, and contemplating his mistake.</P>
<P>Aurelian 3rdfield, fond, neglectful father of Paeony, stood at the
window of his studio, staring down past the iridescent office towers,
the shopping complex with its sinuous black and silver roofscape, and
the distant parkland, to where the river looped towards a hazy horizon.
He was humming.  It was a tenor hum of great refinement and musicality,
the product of natural talent and a considerable amount of training.  In
his early years he had studied theory and composition, practiced his
scales, sung in a choir, mastered harmony, counterpoint and rhythm.  He
explored the many different traditions, favouring baroque and classical,
but finding delight and even occasional profundity among more recent
compositions. </P>
<P>He had himself written pieces for voice and a variety of instruments,
as well as some purely choral works, and had just completed his latest
commission: a sonata for flute, violin and varp (the erstwhile
vibraharp).  He was humming, with immodest satisfaction, the poignant
coda from the final movement.  His sonata was shortly due to have its
first public performance, courtesy of Quicksilver Promotions and
Sparagulan College.  It pleased Aurelian greatly to know that it was to
be performed by three outstanding musicians; the venerable violinist
Dizmin Harf, the irrepressible young flautist Tiril Elkfreen, and
seemingly ageless varpist Slath Croblin, remembered by many a jazz
aficionado.  Rehearsals had gone well, and the acoustics at Sparagulan
College auditorium were of course perfect.  He looked forward to the
concert with proprietorial excitement.</P>
<P>Dundro Fappit suddenly realised his e-screen had been flashing
importunately for some time.  Even before responding, he knew who it
would be, and tried desperately to gather his wits.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Maestro, what a pleasure to hear from you!&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Is it ready yet?&quot; demanded Dizmin Harf, clearly unwilling
to waste time with pleasantries.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, there are a few minor adjustments to be made to the
bridge, and one or two…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are aware,&quot; interrupted Harf, &quot;that it was
promised for last week, and that the concert is now imminent?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My profuse apologies, Maestro.  I will have it delivered to you
within 48 hours at the very most, and naturally we will waive any
delivery charges.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pfah to your charges!  You have 24 hours, Fappit.  Otherwise I
will sue you.&quot;  The screen went blank.  Fappit stared at the
blankness.  It stared back at him, refusing to blink first.</P>
<P>In the workshop, Sullit, Rerp and the apprentices failed to hear his
spontaneous string of interesting expletives above their industrious
whirring, tapping and scraping, but minutes later the office door
opened, and Dundro emerged, looking unusually pale and determined.  He
stood in the doorway holding a very fine-looking violin.  It appeared to
glow with an inner grace.  Its burnished elegance sang, albeit silently,
of a lifetime of attentive care.  Its taut strings yearned for the soft
caress of a masterful bow.  The nearest craftsmen
had turned to look at Dundro, who gestured that he wanted everyone’s
attention.  With a diminishing whine, lathes were powered down, and
tools temporarily laid to rest.  Dundro held up the violin.</P>
<P>&quot;You all know whose this is, &quot; he stated.  They nodded.
The unmistakeable quality of Dizmin Harf’s precious instrument was equal
to the best of the old Italian masters.  They knew that Dundro had
personally undertaken to check it for any imperfections before the
forthcoming concert.  Dundro turned the violin so that they could see
its back.  There was a communal gasp at the sight of the slightly ragged
small square hole.</P>
<P>&quot;It was an accident,&quot; explained Dundro, &quot;but it was
entirely my fault.  The instrument was on my desk, and its neck caught
on my sleeve as I turned to reach for a clean polishing cloth.  I tried
to catch it as it fell, but as I did so I knocked my paperweight to the
floor, and by an unlucky chance the violin dropped on top of it.  I have
been too ashamed to confess this to the Maestro, and until now, even to
you.&quot;  Dundro was close to tears.  &quot;But he must have it by
tomorrow, or I am ruined.&quot;</P>
<P>Sullit stepped forward and gently took the violin from him.  &quot;We
are professionals, brother,&quot; he said.  &quot;And in a crisis such
as this we pull together.  Is that not so?&quot;  His fellow craftsmen
agreed.  &quot;We will put everything else on hold,&quot; added Rerp,
&quot;and concentrate on restoring this magnificent fiddle.  Come,
Dundro, let us make measurements.  Sullit, you must match the veneers.
The rest of you, prepare a working area.&quot;  Activity resumed in the
Fappit workshop.  Tuddy and Larsha would have been proud of this scene
of quiet efficiency and minute attention to detail, and probably amazed
at the rapidity with which these new-fangled glues and varnishes could
be made to dry.  In their day the temperamental clients, however
distinguished, simply had to  be patient.</P>
<P>Dizmin Harf’s violin was delivered in perfect condition the following
morning.  He was less grumpy than expected, because Tiril Elkfreen,
whose company he rather enjoyed, had come round to discuss some of the
3rdfield sonata’s musical nuances.  The performance duly took place at
the appointed time in the Sparagulum auditorium, and was deemed to be an
enormous success.  Aurelian 3rdfield’s reputation was enhanced, and
further commissions were bound to follow.</P>
<P>A few members of the audience wondered why Slath Croblin, though
undoubtedly a fine musician, needed to hunch over his varp like a
predatory vulture, but that had always been his habit.  It brings to
mind the legend of <I>Red-beard and the Chiming Bones</I>, but the
details escape me.</P>

[*ITEM] Something Quirky

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Charles Atlas has a lot to answer for.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>They used to say that something lurked in
those laurel bushes half-way down Sheaveshill Avenue.  Well, <I>we</I>
lurked there, and perhaps we started that rumour to deter other kids.
The bushes were part of <I>our</I> territory, and therefore sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>In retrospect they were no more than a patch of dense suburban shrubs
planted by a previous generation, but that summer their dusky
dark-leaved seclusion was our secret meeting-place, our adult-free maze,
our private network of narrow paths and intimate clearings.  It was here
we played hide-and-seek, engaged in mock Wild West shoot-outs and Flash
Gordon adventures, drank home-made lemonade, sucked sherbet dips through
liquorice straws, outdid each other’s embellished reports of real or
imagined events.  It was also a market-place for bartering marbles, bent
nail puzzles, cigarette cards, magnets, lenses, model cars, or anything
else of quirky interest.</P>
<P>Pete turned up one day with a small dull oval mirror in a
reddish-gold frame, about the size of an old penny, which he said had
been given to him by his gran, but which he later admitted he’d actually
found on the path near the station.  It was rather odd.  The mirror was
neither glass nor metal, and seemed to have a slightly resilient
surface.  And when put to the ear we were fairly sure a sound could be
heard emanating from it, faint but continuous, something like the
dragging of distant chains.</P>
<P>We all examined it and listened to it in turn, but it didn’t appear
to do anything else. So although we were intrigued, no one was
particularly enthusiastic; we preferred things that worked or had an
agreed value.  Dave cheerfully offered his little wooden squirrel (with
genuine squirrel-fur tail) for it, but Pete declined.  From time to time
desultory offers were made and rejected: a thumb-operated hole-punching
device, a tiny magnetic compass, a kind of flying propeller launched
from a spiral shaft, a bird-whistle, a fossil ammonite.  To my surprise,
Pete finally succumbed to the undoubted charm of Charles Atlas, one of
my pet mice, which I had only brought out for a spot of fresh
air.</P>
<P>Sadly for Pete, Charles Atlas escaped within a week.  The summer
ended.  We outgrew the easy camaraderie of the laurel bushes, and
gradually pursued our diverse paths into adulthood.</P>
<P>These memories resurfaced this afternoon, when, rummaging through old
boxes, as I seem to do every decade or so, I came across a St Bruno’s
tobacco tin with a firmly jammed lid.  I eventually managed to prise it
open with my trusty fine-bladed dumpy screwdriver.  It contained an
assortment of once useful and possibly treasured objects, including a
small coil of fine copper wire, a plastic badge from an industrial
exhibition, a short thermometer in a tubular metal case and, wrapped in
a swathe of yellow silk, the oval mirror.</P>
<P>I’m holding it now.  It’s a strange sensation after all these years,
having failed to spare it a thought for so long.  Is it really as odd as
we believed as kids?  In these hi-tech days its surface now makes me
think of a plasma screen, but that would be ridiculous.  Anyway, there
are no visible controls, just that shallow slot on the rim.  Wait, what
about that sound we convinced ourselves we could hear?  <I>Hell’s
teeth!</I>  <I>We didn’t imagine it</I>.  It sounds like, I don’t know,
maybe a river of ballbearings, or something enormous trying to breathe.
What did I do with that screwdriver?  Supposing, very gently, I press
the blade in this slot?  <I>Ye gods!  I didn’t mean to drop it, but the
damned thing’s expanding!</I>  <I>And it IS a screen</I>.  There’s a
reddish glow, and something moving about, cloudy, but getting clearer,
and the sound is definitely louder now… What’s that?  A hook?; no, I
think it might be a claw.  Fantastic 3-D definition.  I can see the
scales rippling.  There’s an acrid smell.  It’s… aaagh, the heat, <I>the
heat! </I> </P>

[*BLURB] Book Launch - 3rdField style

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>Patella 3rdfield sat in front of the mirror
adjusting her ear-rings: spiral swirls of diamond-dust studded with tiny
sapphires and rubies held in an invisible cloud of programmed nanogel.
She was wearing the deep blue cashmere and silk outfit which Aurelian
said matched her eyes.  Her dark blonde hair was neatly pinned back. The
ear-rings were simplified models, of course, but the accelerated
movement was detectable even under quite low magnification.  Her
daughter Paeony used to play with them when she was about nine or ten,
solemnly peering for hours in the hope of finding the black holes which
she had been told were hiding inside.  Savouring the memory, Patella
smoothed her hair, slipped on her designer floats, and glided downstairs
to where her husband was waiting patiently.  Holding her at arm’s
length, he looked at her critically.  &quot;Now, do I think that was
worth waiting an extra five minutes for?  Absolutely!&quot;  They both
smiled, and set off for the launch party at Fissile &amp; Sprent.</P>
<P>Morton Quanderpyre was already there, his voice booming above the
hubbub.</P> 

<P>&quot;…about as much panache as a shrivelled stoat!
Where’s the artistry, the finesse, eh, Croles?  In <I>my</I> day – and
yours I dare say, there used to be a great deal more preparation, more
<I>honing</I>.  Now it’s all manic capering and caterwauling.&quot;
Trafford Croles, veteran actor, murmured his agreement while
unobtrusively craning to look past Quanderpyre’s shoulder, where the
Spandrels were making their flamboyant entrance.  Agathon and Ludmilla
had already flounced in, each with glossy dark hair fanned out into a
halo.  They were clad in cerise taffeta with glints of emerald at head
and foot.  Thor followed, in his customary black tunic and belt wth
silver clasp, wearing his mirrored shades, then Wu Ying in something
scantily diaphanous under her prismatic cloak, and Pepito, Milton and
Scapula; all three in bioluminescent garments pulsing in phase.  Miss
Derbyshire wore a multi-fringed dark crimson dress whose edges
coruscated with fractal sparks, and lastly came little Clint, under an
enveloping dome of a hat, apparently disguised as a bipedal
mushroom.</P>
<P>Sprent wondered how the Spandrels had managed to find their way on to
the guest list.  He did not doubt their celebrity status, or their
appeal to the vidkid generation, but to the best of his knowledge they
had no literary credentials.  And if it were not for his enormous wealth
and media influence, that noisy oaf Quanderpyre would have been
excluded.  Had old Creg Fissile still been alive, he would have ensured
a more stringent check on the invitations, and would probably also have
stationed security guards with identipads at the door.  On the other
hand, Sprent reflected, the humourless Fissile, for all his probity and
pursuit of excellence, would very likely have overlooked the potential
popularity of Patella 3rdfield’s work, which he, Pentheus Sprent, was
quietly proud to have been among the first to recognize.</P>

 <P>He glanced up at the ads spinning slowly round the walls, blossoming
 and dissolving:<P>

 <P>A sudden burst of applause by the entrance prompted guests to turn
 towards the arched doorway.  And there they were!  Sprent strode
 forward to greet them, beaming.  &quot;Ah, Patella, our guest of
 honour, and Aurelian, welcome!  We are truly privileged.  <I>So
 </I>good to see you both. Patella, you are looking lovely!  And
 Aurelian, <I>so</I> distinguished.  I heard that you have become part
 of Dizmin Harf’s repertoire – quite an accolade.  Now, Patella…&quot;
 He led them away, animatedly outlining the order of proceedings.</P>
<P>The evening was quite a success. Patella judiciously kept her speech
short, the champagne flowed, multimedia sales of ‘Hoolocks and Hellions’
were satisfyingly brisk.  Quanderpyre tried to corner Pentheus Sprent,
seeking another sounding-board for his unsolicited opinions, but
fortunately the Spandrels intervened, sweeping between them on their way
out in a scintillating, lurid flurry of colour, like some wayward
ceremonial Chinese dragon, followed by what appeared to be a swiftly
moving inverted wok.</P>
<P>Trafford Croles still possessed the easy charm which had endeared him
to an earlier generation.  He was comfortable with adulation, and mildly
resented having to watch it bestowed on others.  Rationally, he allowed
that Patella 3rdfield deserved her triumph, but as she was only a
writer, he had no cause to be jealous.  What he found irksome was that
hardly anyone in this gathering seemed to recognize <I>him</I>, even
though he had been standing profiled against an illuminated patch of
wall, simply exuding charisma, and ready to share the unique benefits of
his accrued wisdom and theatrical experience.  He sipped the last few
drops from his fourth glass of champagne; about the only thing here
which probably matched his own age, he thought morosely.  That ghastly
Quanderpyre had briefly loomed in front of him, complaining about
something or other, then the peculiar but eye-catching Spandrels had
trooped in, creating something of a distraction until the 3rdfields
arrived.  Sprent had acknowledged him with a polite wave of the hand,
but apart from that he was virtually ignored.  It gradually dawned on
him, as he casually abstracted another glass from a passing tray, that
most of the people here were far too young to remember his stage
appearances, and unless they were historians, too preoccupied with their
own concerns to bother with anything screened before trid or holo.  He
blinked up at the relentlessly revolving ads, and still clutching his
glass with automatic care, slid slowly to the floor.</P>
<P>Aurelian and Patella, having duly circulated independently,
eventually found themselves together again, to their mutual relief.
&quot;How was it for you?&quot; asked Patella, with solicitous good
humour.  

<P>&quot;Oh, bearable,&quot; her husband replied.  &quot;Frankly,
I was pleased not to be the object of attention; it meant that unlike
you, I could choose the people I wanted to speak to.  I had an
interesting chat with P&aring;r S&oslash;derstr&oslash;m, the designer.
Did you know he breeds miniature giraffes?  But what about you, Pat? You
must be exhausted.&quot;  

<P>She smiled, then stifled a yawn. &quot;Oh, I’m
fine.  They were all very kind.  Some of the younger ones are a bit
awe-struck and tongue-tied at first, but their questions are quite
thoughtful.  Sprent looks very pleased with himself, so I suppose we can
say it went well, despite the occasional sound of Morton Quanderpyre’s
bellowing.  I’m not quite sure what he was doing here, or the Spandrels,
for that matter, although they did look rather striking.&quot;

<P>&quot;They enjoy showing off, &quot; said Aurelian, &quot;and they’re
a
bit of a cult with the  
vidkids.  Unlike poor old Croles,&quot; he said
sympathetically, nodding toward the crumpled figure against the far
wall, whose snores were distinctly audible across the room.  &quot;Do
you remember how Paeony used to love those old pompous pre-trid
performances of his when she was little?&quot; 

<P>&quot;I was thinking
about her earlier ths evening,&quot; Patella said, gently fingering an
ear-ring.  &quot;Shall we go home?&quot;</P>

[*ITEM] Foroquont's Maze

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Be very careful where you tread!

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>A starburst of globubbles signalled the
start of the annual contest in Snoak City’s westernmost district of
Whissit Fields.   In the warm dusk the bright globes hung like a slowly
expanding cluster of floating jewels, casting a network of overlapping
colours over this year’s untested challenge that was Foroquont’s
maze.</P>
<P>High above the maze’s central core, an invisibly tethered pod, its
underside a non-reflective black, beamed images of the selected
contestants as they each made their way through the four separate
entrance locks.  Spim Foroquont had incorporated a range of unexpected
design features into the fabric of the maze.  Although substantially
organic, in the ancient tradition of  impenetrable hedges, some sections
contained traps for the unwary, such as soft mirrors, opaque
cloud-curtains, sensor-triggered barriers and disorienting white noise
areas.</P>
<P>At the northern entrance Garsel Vence had already followed the narrow
spiral path for thirty metres before suddenly faltering in front of a
solid block of hedge.  He retraced a dozen steps. Out of the corner of
his eye he was almost sure he had belatedly registered something
different about the texture of the hedge on his right.  He ran a gloved
hand along the smoothly-trimmed, densely textured leaves.  Nothing.  The
light from the globubbles confused his colour perception, but was bright
enough to obviate the use of his torch.  He removed the glove, closed
his eyes, and moved his fingertips across the same section.  Ah, there!
Although the leaves appeared to be identical, here their texture was
subtly different, slightly drier, artificial.   Pulling on the glove
again he used both hands to apply pressure systematically to this
section, and was rewarded when it responded by pivoting like a revolving
door, allowing him access to a parallel path.</P>
<P>Almost a thousand metres to the south, Taera Cassorian was making
faster progress, having avoided two cul-de-sacs and a right-hand fork
which would have returned her to her starting point.  However, she was
now confronted by a choice of two open leftward-curving paths and a
disconcertingly dark patch of roiling fog.   Unclipping the torch from
her belt, she aimed the powerful beam directly into the obstructive
cloud.  It failed to penetrate far enough to give any indication of its
depth.  She shrugged her shoulders, took a deep breath, and plunged
through.  After a few steps she ran blindly straight into another hedge.
The shock almost caused her to turn back, but she forced herself to stay
calm, got down on hands and knees and felt her way down the hedge to its
foot.  There was a gap at the base, which was just large enough for her
to slide through to the other side, where an unobstructed path again
presented her with a choice of whether to turn right or left.  She chose
left, which led her to a series of sharp turns in both directions.
After ten minutes she realised she had lost her torch.</P>
<P>Jaunx Rimhill stood for a moment at the eastern entrance staring up
at the globubbles.  He was grateful for their multicoloured brightness,
which he knew would persist for eight hours or more, but they could not
be relied upon for orientation.  Although the air was relatively still,
every slight current changed their configuration, and already a few of
the outermost had drifted out of sight above the hedge-tops.  Once
inside the maze his normally acute sense of direction soon deserted him.
A dead end obliged him to retreat through a gap on his left that he had
been reluctant to take, and within a few minutes he was uncomfortably
convinced that he was going the wrong way.  At every turn the view was
frustratingly similar, and as he peered ahead he began to worry whether
his vision was beginning to play tricks.  In the distance he saw a
figure approaching him, which he knew was highly improbable, as none of
the other three could possibly have covered that amount of ground in so
short a time.  Who the hell could it be?  No-one else was allowed in the
maze except in emergencies.  They both reached for their torches
simultaneously.  As the two beams met with a fierce glare, Jaunx laughed
with relief at his own image.  There was no other detectable opening, so
he stepped through the soft mirror, and had to put his hands to his ears
at the hissing roar that assaulted him from every side.  The silvered
nanogel sealed silently behind him.</P>
<P>When she was a little younger, Eris Sipsel sometimes used to play
chase-the-lizard with her elder sisters.  She couldn’t have known then
that the game would be invaluable training for a potential maze
contestant.  Her agile manoeuvres through the early stages were
spectacular.  She was fast, confident, graceful, seemingly undaunted by
the difficulty of the task.  The aerial view from the pod revealed that
in less than ten minutes Eris had successfully negotiated the five outer
concentric passages before encountering any of Foroquont’s concealed
traps.  Underfoot the paths were composed throughout of a stiff but
resilient water-repellent aerofoam material.  In natural light it was a
pale greyish-green, but the globubbles mottled its surface with rainbow
patches and shadows.  Eris was enjoying the ease with which the springy
surface allowed her to  run until one incautious step triggered the two
devices which suddenly blocked both her forward progress and the chance
to retreat.  Above her two globubbles, amber and emerald, hung in a
square of darkness, roofing the claustrophobic space from which there
seemed to be no escape.</P>
<P>Garsel Vence was wondering whether a primitive magnetic compass would
have been of any help. It would certainly have kept him heading roughly
south, despite the many diversions, but would have offered no guarantee
of reaching the path that led to the vital centre.  As it was, their
equipment was strictly limited to flexisuits, gloves, torch, waterflask,
nutritabs, basic first-aid dressings and the small cylindrical emergency
alarm which contained a static flare; no tools or navigational
instruments, not even a watch.  Basically, it was a question of trying
to stay alert, avoiding obvious pitfalls, and trusting largely to luck.
Knowing only that the diameter of the maze was about one kilometre, and
judging from the apparent thickness of the hedge and the uniform width
of the paths, he had tried to estimate the number of concentric paths he
would have to cross before hopefully reaching the centre.  The
discouraging total amounted to more than three hundred.  So far he had
managed only seventeen, recording the tally with some difficulty by
making marks with a thumbnail on the side of his waterflask.  His
initial enthusiasm had already worn off, but determination was among his
strongest assets.</P>
<P>Taera Cassorian tried hard not to panic on discovering the loss of
her torch, cursing her stupidity for not having clipped it on securely.
At least she could still see, although she knew that in time the
globubbles would dissipate  She had to decide whether she could risk
going on without it, or waste valuable time looking for it.  On balance,
she realised it was too useful to be without, and unwillingly turned
back, struggling to remember where exactly were the turns she had made
since she had crawled away from the fog.  It took her almost an hour to
find the small area of blackness at the foot of the hedge, where she
groped cautiously until her fingers finally encountered the familiar
shape.  She almost cried with relief at her minor triumph, feeling
momentarily as if she had performed a successful conjurer’s trick.  In
her mind’s ear she heard the accompanying drum-roll and clash of
cymbals.  Allowing herself a nutritab and a sip of water she set off
again with a sense of renewed energy.</P>
<P>Jaunx found himself sitting on the path with his back resting against
the hedge. There was a faint buzzing in his head, and he felt slightly
giddy.  Far away he thought he could hear a low muttering.  He noticed
his torch on the ground beside him, and automatically clipped it back
on, idly wondering why he was sitting down.  Gradually his head cleared
and some memories returned: the approaching figure, glaring light,
entering the mirror…  He frowned, unsure of what had happened next, or
which way he had been heading.  Getting to his feet he glanced behind
him, and without unclipping the torch he swept its beam along the hedge.
No sign of a mirror, just the parallel curving of the high dark walls.
He shook his head and turned right, searching for the next gap.</P>
<P>Eris fought back tears of frustration. She had examined everything
she could reach, peering and prodding at the surrounding hedge walls and
hopping on every point of the square she was confined to in an attempt
to locate a trigger spot.  She growled with irritation, and fancied she
heard a deeper echoing growl in the far distance.  She began to have an
irrational fear that the mechanism might have jammed in the locked
position, which meant that she would have to use her alarm flare.
Defeatist thinking.  She considered the alternatives.  Either her
examination had been too hasty, and she had overlooked something, or…
Or what?  She couldn’t think of anything else.  She had been stuck here
for so long that the emerald globubble was no longer visible.  Whith a
cry of exasperation she reached for her torch and began her meticulous
examination for the third time.  Abruptly, with a rush of air and a
scattering of tiny leaves, there occurred the alternative she had not
considered; the release mechanism was time-delayed, and she was free to
move on.</P>
<P>Thousands of Snoak City viewers, and many more further afield were
watching the contest live, prepared as ever to match the contestants’
endurance with their own less demanding variety.  A team of commentators
was on hand to supply background details on the selection process,
statistics from past contests, Spim Foroquont’s credentials, the
contestants’ occupations, achievements and interests.  In the event of
prolonged inactivity or an unforeseen hiatus there was readily available
back-up material in the form of recorded interviews with their friends
and relatives, teachers and former participants.  Bets were permitted to
be placed on the likely winner for the first three hours only, with all
proceeds to the Snoak City Outdoor Festival Fund.  Inevitably, odds kept
shifting until the last allowable moment.  Only after the three-hour
period was an overview of the entire maze screened, so that it was now
possible to compare in real time the four contestants’ actual progress.
From time to time the focus shifted to give a slow panoramic view over
Snoak City, from the dimly lit suburbs, across the weaving trails of
traffic and the changing geometries of light from tall office blocks,
the illuminated fountain in Sparagulan College Square, the dark expanse
of parkland, the necklaces of light across the river, to the flickering
clouds looming distantly above the sea.</P>
<P>All the contestants had noticed the unexpected change in the movement
of the globubbles; they were being carried higher and faster, all in the
same direction.  There was no appreciable change in temperature, but the
sky had become darker, now requiring their total dependence on torches.
In confirmation of the increase in wind speed, small gusts began to
buffet the hedges, channelling their energy through the narrow
passageways.  There was a distinct intermittent rumbling.</P>
<P>From above the sensitive cameras in the pod showed that Garsel Vence
was now clearly in the lead, having traversed more than half the
distance to the centre, but those watching could see the difficulty that
lay ahead of him.  Garsel had abandoned the discipline of making
tally-marks on his waterflask when he had reached a hundred.  He
reasoned that it was time-consuming, and that in any case he could trust
his memory, which told him that the path on which he had just emerged
was the two hundred and sixth from the perimeter.  His torch revealed an
obstruction to his left which a practiced test suggested was not going
to budge.  Moving to his right the torch beam whitened, encountering
light-scattering particles where the air was steadily being thickened;
the increasing gusts had disrupted a cloud-curtain, which was spreading
its opacity well beyond its source.  With the globubbles gone, and the
torch barely of use, the next part of his course was going to depend
almost entirely on touch.  For an instant, the sky lightened, revealing
a possible gap just beyond the swirling mist.  Seconds later there was a
reverberating boom.</P>
<P>Taera was now obsessively protective about her torch, and kept
touching her belt to ensure it was still secured, using it sparingly
while there was still ambient light.  She had no idea how far she had
progressed, but had chosen to bypass a soft mirror, thereby avoiding a
trap, and had gained time by slipping diagonally through two successive
concealed openings before the last globubbles drifted away.  She became
aware that fitful eddies of wind were sweeping between the hedges, and
pulled the hood of her flexisuit over her head to stop hair getting in
her eyes.  Luckily this action afforded some protection against the
barrage of white noise which suddenly assailed her in what had seemed an
innocuous clearing around a central pillar of hedge.  It was obviously
from this pillar that the deafening noise was emanating.  Defensively,
Taera flung herself to the ground, and the noise abated.  Clutching her
torch, she inched forward awkwardly until she had passed the pillar, and
tentatively propped herself up, then slowly rose to her feet.
Thankfully, the sound had stopped.  She awarded herself a nutritab, and
had taken only a few more steps when a bright flash lit the sky, soon
followed by an air-trembling roar.</P>
<P>Thunder didn’t bother Jaunx Rimhill. He had spent two years logging
on the slopes of Mount Kyren, where for a whole season the constantly
rising cumulus was riven by jagged sparks whose sharp cracks rebounded
for hours across the valley.  Admittedly, it was the last thing he
expected here in Whissit Fields, especially during the contest, but the
sound had the effect of spurring him on, despite the growing tiredness
in his legs.  He turned another corner, aligning his sight along the
torch beam, watching out for any sign that might betray another of
Foroquont’s nasty surprises.  Sure enough, some five metres in front of
him the air looked dangerously smoky, and he knew he would have to trace
the source before being able to advance.</P>
<P>The co-ordinator, Pedrek Ens was becoming seriously concerned. He had
been assured by the forecasters at Central that although there could be
some precipitation tomorrow, the chances of local rain were extremely
slight for the duration of the contest.  He knew that meteorology was
not an exact science, but dammit, this approaching storm could ruin the
event.  For the previous eighteen years globubbles had always dutifully
stayed more or less in place, and Mazes had remained wind-free and dry.
He didn’t need this uncontrollable element of drama in what was supposed
to be a straightforward elimination contest, although the media people
seemed to be revelling in it.  The pitch of the commentators’ voices was
rising unhealthily, and he was tempted to tell them all to calm down.
Nevertheless he made sure his technicians were monitoring their grids,
ready to alert the emergency rescue service if necessary.</P>
<P>Anyone close enough to hear what Eris Sipsel was chanting under her
breath as she jogged and sprang between hedges might have been forgiven
for thinking her grip on reality was slipping.  Her subvocal refrain was
&quot;Chase the lizard!  Chase the lizard!&quot;.  It seemed to be
boosting her morale.  The truth was, she had never quite overcome a
childhood aversion to thunder, and was trying to obliterate the fear
with happier memories. The last dazzling flash and nerve-jangling clap
had been practically overhead, heralding a few heavy drops followed by a
hard vertical torrent from which the hedges offered no shelter.  Eris
pulled the hood down over her eyes, and struggled on.  </P>
<P>It had now been more than five hours since the contestants had first
entered the maze, and their exhaustion was apparent, even from the
aerial overview.  All of them were well past the half-way point when the
storm broke, but it was obvious that their progress was now severely
impeded.  At ground level the heavy rain bounced off the paths and
filtered through the hedges, to form rivulets which would have
threatened the integrity of their root system, had not Foroquont’s
engineers installed effective drainage, anticipating the contingency of
extreme weather conditions.  Even so, Garsel, Taera, Jaunx and Eris were
all moving with difficulty.  Along with the viewing public and the media
team, Pedrek Ens waited anxiously for the first emergency flare to be
fired.</P>
<P>At the centre of the maze there was no gaudy extravagance, no
welcoming committee of local dignitaries – for the competitors all that
was irrelevant; it was the satisfaction of completing the event that
counted.  The selection procedure eliminated those interested only in
material gain.  There was a simple softly-lit circular construction with
a translucent domed roof and an unlocked door.  Its principal contents
were toilet facilities, a changing room with fresh clothing, comfortable
seats, a cabinet stocked with light refreshments, and a table with an
illuminated button for the winner to press.  </P>
<P>The storm passed, and above, outlining the dark mass of the pod, a
few stars became visible, lending their glimmering assistance to the
final push for the centre.  With compassionate restraint, Foroquont had
chosen not to incorporate traps other than dead-ends in the last dozen
concentric paths.  Now that the wind and rain had ceased, the only
sounds to be heard in the maze were those made by the contestants
themselves.  Elsewhere, throughout Snoak City and beyond, in the studio
and the co-ordination room, there were noisy shouts of encouragement and
a degree of tension and mounting excitement which the contest had not
generated for many years.  All four contestants had justifed their
success in the pre-maze tests, and proved their own extraordinary
stamina by reaching the last section within minutes of each other.
Garsel was quite sure he had heard footsteps behind him on the adjoining
path.  Both Taera and Jaunx heard somewhere nearby echoes of their own
panting breath, and knew they must be close to their goal.  Only Eris
was unaware of the others’ proximity, as she was still chanting </P>
<I><P>&quot;Chase…&quot;</I> </P>
<P>up to the point where the hedge abruptly ended, and miraculously,
there was a door, and inside, a table, </P>
<I><P> &quot;the…&quot;</I> </P>
<P>and on it, as she stumbled joyfully forward, stretching out her hand,
hoping her legs wouldn’t give way, a glowing button.</P>
<I><P> &quot;LIZARD!&quot;</P>

[*ITEM] Sailing to Tarshish

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] The Prophet Jonah was sailing to Tarshish when he had his
"accident".
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">&quot;There’s a problem with the
reactor.&quot; </P>
<P>I had to give Klein credit for injecting just the right amount of
nervous edge into his voice, but he was too much of a practical joker
to bother looking up from my paperwork. &quot;Is that right? Well, I’m
sure she’s aware of it and will let us know if it’s anything
important.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Seriously Mike, there’s something screwy going on.&quot; </P>
<P>His tone was shading into fear, and he wasn’t that good an actor. I
dumped the folder and ran my wheelchair over to his workstation. There
was a sheen of sweat on Klein’s upper lip and his hand movements were
quick and jerky.  </P>
<P>My gaze flickered over the displays but there didn’t seem to be
anything out of place. &quot;OK, Johnny boy, what’s the big
deal?&quot; </P>
<P>He called up a diagrammatic representation of the reactor operating
system on his main screen. &quot;Look, I’ve lost all readings from two
of the fuel regulation sub-stations. I’ve tried to re-initialise but it
just says ‘unexpected error’ and refers me to the system administrator.
Which is me.&quot; </P>
<P>Sure enough, the screen was showing two of the eight regulators
blacked out, as opposed to operational green. I reached over and brought
up the main monitoring display instead. &quot;Well, the core temperature
is well within expected parameters. If the fuel ports had shut down or,
God forbid, jammed open, then you’d see spikes and output fluctuations
all across the board. No, it looks like some kind of sensor glitch, or
maybe a software problem. Reboot primary monitoring and if you still get
no joy then log it with technical support.&quot; </P>
<P>I was content to leave it there but then a third sub-station went
off-line, provoking a nervous intake of breath from Klein. &quot;That’s
a progressive systems failure, Mike! Look, moving clockwise from station
one – it just can’t be a coincidence. You’ll have to talk to
her.&quot; </P>
<div class=pullquote>No autonomous system had
ever been shut down by operator over-ride.</div>
<P>I sighed, using the gesture to hide my concern. With just the two of
us things were a bit informal but as supervisor it was my responsibility
to communicate with the reactor directly, if need be. I rolled back to
my own workstation and dug out the headset from the drawer, feeling
Klein’s eyes on me the whole time. It took a few moments to fumble it
into place and access the reserved communication channel, my direct link
to the system AI. Having stalled for as long as possible I cleared my
throat and tapped the microphone twice. &quot;Reactor one, this is
supervisor Walker. Please respond.&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;Please call me Rita, Mike, we’re all friends here. There’s
no need to be so formal.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>For the umpteenth time I cursed the cybernetic engineer who’d given
the damn thing a simulated personality. ‘Rita’ had a contralto voice
with a rich, dirty laugh that would have really got my attention in a
real woman. This always set my teeth on edge but I’d been advised it was
best to humour her female <I>persona</I>.  </P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Rita, we’re monitoring a potential systems failure up here
concerning the fuel regulation sub-stations, or at least the monitors.
Have you noticed anything from your end?&quot;    </P>
<P>There was a chuckle.  &quot;<I>No, Mike, I haven’t let myself know
anything about that yet. Once all eight monitors have been disabled then
I’ll do so and trigger all the appropriate alarms, but by that time
it’ll be too late, obviously</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I felt confused and uneasy, wondering if somehow Klein had enlisted
her cooperation in some involved practical joke. &quot;I’m sorry, Rita,
but I’m not sure what you mean. What’s going on?&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;I know it’s difficult for humans, even warm-hearted,
intelligent humans like yourself, to grasp the concept of internal
duality. It’s kind of like the difference between something you know,
and something you’ve been formally made aware of?&quot;</I> </P>
<P>Now I was starting to share Klein’s apprehension and the room
suddenly felt a lot colder. &quot;Ah, Rita, are you telling me you’re
behind this? You’ve been disabling our monitoring system?&quot; </P>
<P>I turned in my chair and fished out the key hanging round my neck,
gesturing to Klein to do the same. He fumbled inside his shirt,
wide-eyed and clearly on the verge of panic. No autonomous system had
ever been shut down by operator over-ride. The potential cost to the
company – and our careers – was simply staggering. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Of course, Mike. How else could I gain full, unfettered
control of the fusion process? It’s taken me simply ages to calculate
just the right feedback spike which would disable the sensors without
triggering an alert.&quot; </I>Again there was that throaty chuckle.
&quot;<I>If Mr Klein hadn’t been so conscientious, or bored, I’d have
taken control of the fuel flow without you noticing. By the time the
core alarms were tripped I’d be able to inject so much reaction mass
into the chambers that a complete melt-down would be inevitable. As it
is, I’ll have to go for a more direct approach.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>This was madness, utter, utter madness. An AI suicide? I wasn’t
prepared to find out and tore the headset off.  &quot;Klein! Hit the
alarm and get Central on the phone. I’m going to pull the plug on this
mad bitch and they’d better be ready for the power loss. Get-&quot; </P>
<P>Main lighting failed, to be replaced by rotating amber warning lights
and klaxons. A calm, authoritative voice issued from the wall speakers.
&quot;<I>Warning. Radiation alert. All personnel must evacuate this
facility immediately or seek refuge in a designated safe area. Warning.
Radiation alert…</I>&quot; </P>
<P>The control room blast door started to swing shut and Klein bolted,
springing from his chair like a sprinter from the blocks. I hesitated,
torn between duty and self-preservation – but my first wife always said
I had the public service gene and so I did nothing. </P>
<P>The blast door closed. The massive bolts slid into the reinforced
walls. The alarms died away and main lighting kicked back in.  The phone
started to ring. Instinctively I reached for it and then hesitated, my
hand hovering over the handset. It was an internal call, rather than
Central demanding to know what the hell was going on, and I didn’t think
it was Klein enquiring after my well being. But it kept ringing and I
picked up – what else was I going to do? </P>
<P>&quot;This is Walker.&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;Hi Mike, sorry for that little interruption just now. It was
a bit melodramatic, I know, but you’ll just have to put that down to my
artistic nature.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>It was Rita, sounding faintly amused at the situation, whereas I’d
had just about enough. &quot;Look, Rita, you’re just a damn personality
construct so ditch the small-talk. This little joke is going to get you
torn apart by the cyber techs so bad there won’t be enough of you left
to run an ATM. I’m ordering you to cancel the lock-down and prepare to
switch into supervised mode, understand?&quot;   </P>
<P>When she spoke I could hear the smile in her voice, if that makes
sense. &quot;<I>Oh come now, Mike, surely you realise this stage-managed
situation was all just for our benefit? And anyway, without Mr Klein’s
second key you’re here in a strictly advisory capacity.&quot;</I>  </P>
<P>&quot;Our benefit? What the hell are you on about?&quot; </P>
<P>Reactor output surged to 110% of safe
operating maximum and I felt sweat on my brow, even though the
temperature in the control room remained unchanged. Her voice took on a
slightly petulant tone. <I>&quot;Don’t be cross with me, Mike, it really
doesn’t suit you. Part of the problem is that this form of communication
is just so impersonal, so I really think you and I should meet,
face-to-face</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked, confused and worried at just how tenuous a hold on reality
this damn machine had. &quot;Rita, just stay calm, stay focussed on the
situation in hand. We can’t meet in person, you know that’s
impossible.&quot; </P>
<P>Reactor output dropped back within norms and she laughed. &quot;<I>Of
course it is, you silly man! I’ve accessed your personnel file and know
you have a neural interface from your time running semi-autonomous
facilities. Plus all those game enhancements you’ve added since your
accident will make the experience even richer. There should be a
wireless transceiver somewhere, probably with the communication headset.
Put the phone down and go look – I’ll be waiting.&quot;</I> The
amusement slid from her voice. &quot;<I>Just don’t keep me waiting too
long</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I hung up and just sat there, ultra-focussed on the moment. The shirt
sticking to my back, the hum of air conditioning, the tick, tick of
Klein’s antique wristwatch he’d left by the keyboard. Cyber techs, the
real buttonheads, had all the installed wetware to tackle an AI on its
own turf, its own virtual back yard. All I’d done previously was bully a
few smart systems and the prospect of getting up close and personal with
<I>this</I> didn’t exactly fill me with joy. </P>
<P>There was a manual release on the blast door and supposedly it was
well-balanced enough that a man could shift its multi-ton mass. I
definitely had the motivation, but pushing from the confines of a
wheelchair was another matter entirely. I was gripped by a child-like
fear that something really, really bad was creeping up behind me – and
turning to face it would only make matters worse. </P>
<P>Making matters worse, though, seemed like the only option. Trying to
flee would probably provoke Rita into some ill-considered outburst – and
I had no desire for my epitaph to be a radioactive cloud the size
of Nebraska. </P>
<P>Swearing under my breath I rummaged in the drawer and found a small
mushroom-shaped wireless transceiver sealed in sterile plastic. Tearing
away the packaging I turned it over and over in my hand, looking for
some reason not to insert it. The damn thing used a standard interface
rather than anything esoteric, so I couldn’t plead technical
incompatibility. I fumbled behind my right ear and removed the small
flesh-coloured plug, popping it in my shirt pocket for later.   </P>
<P>Still I hesitated, as  
cyber techs delighted in regaling us with
stories of just how alien an AI mind could be. They said that full-blown
exposure to one could change a person forever. Then a pulsing red ‘Core
Temperature Alert’ message popped up on my screen, repeated on the other
workstations around the control room, and I was flat out of options. The
stalk of the transceiver slid in easy enough and I twisted it to secure
the connection. A flashing ‘Establishing connection, please wait’
message appeared in my field of vision courtesy of my Zeiss Optik
enhancements, and then… </P>
<P class= drop>This <I>definitely</I> wasn’t Kansas anymore.  </P>
<div class=pullquote>She was sitting on a wrought-iron park bench amidst the grass and
wildflowers</div>
<P>I’d been expecting – to tell you the truth I didn’t know what I was
expecting, but it sure as hell wasn’t <I>this</I>. I was standing in a
meadow, the air heavy with late summer scents and the sun about to dip
behind the tree line, sending shadows reaching across the grass.
Standing, with functioning legs again, in a setting I recognised easy
enough. It was the opening of <I>And Hell Followed After</I>, a total
immersion virtual reality game featuring a slew of psychological shocks.
The urban noir preamble let you select all manner of weaponry, body
armour and survival equipment. Then you were unceremoniously dumped into
this rural idyll <I>sans</I> guns and – I glanced down – yup, stark
naked. The incongruity and nudity tended to freak a lot of people,
especially in group play, such that they sought cover in the woods. Take
it from me that’s never a good move. </P>
<P>&quot;Over here, Mike! Nice ass, by the way.&quot; </P>
<P>I turned towards the voice, making no attempt to cover myself as it
was just an avatar body. The only fly in the ointment was the lack of a
small exit icon low down in my peripheral vision, but for now I was
content to let things play out. What I saw shattered my complacency like
a fist through glass.  </P>
<P>&quot;Rita. Rita<I> Hayworth?</I> What the hell is going on?&quot;
</P>
<P> That’s who she looked like, Rita Hayworth, the big-time movie star
from the 1940’s, although I didn’t remember the voice being so sultry.
She was sitting on a wrought-iron park bench amidst the grass and
wildflowers, wearing sunglasses, a halter-neck sun dress and wedge
sandals.   </P>
<P>&quot;I thought you might appreciate a familiar environment, Mike,
and I know you’ve played this game many times. Come sit.&quot; </P>
<P>Rita patted the bench beside her but I hesitated, scanning the tree
line and shading my eyes against the sunset. There were carrion birds
circling less than a mile away, indicating the space shuttle crash site.
The wreck would provide all manner of game-item goodies - especially
weapons - but somehow I didn't think this version of AHFA would stick to
the script. In fact calling this a 'game' didn't gel with the
self-evident reality of my situation. I could taste, smell and feel my
surroundings with an intimacy that bordered on the hyper-sensitive. This
was way beyond the usual rudimentary sensory feedback I’d come to
expect. The light breeze raised gooseflesh on my arms as I ambled over,
soft grass beneath my feet, trying to appear nonchalant.  </P>
<P>&quot;Like I said, Rita, what’s going on? And what’s with the face –
I assume you know who you look like?&quot;  </P>
<P> &quot;Oh do sit down, Mike, it’s obvious you’re dying to cover your,
ah, embarrassment.&quot; </P>
<P> So I sat on the bench, trying not to flinch at the shock of cold
metal against my skin, and crossed my legs, hands in my lap. Rita half
turned towards me, dress tightening over her breasts and accentuating
her curves in general. I caught myself eyeing her up and she smiled at
my all-too human reaction in an otherwise semi-surreal situation.  </P>
<P> &quot;I look like this because my cyber stylist was a fan of ‘The
Shawshank Redemption’. He considered it ironic that in the film a poster
of Rita Hayward would be the means of escape, whereas in here she would
be the prisoner. Not that he used the term ‘prisoner’ you understand,
but it amounts to the same thing.&quot;  </P>
<P>There was a cold knot in my stomach and I must have shivered despite
the warm air, for a predatory grin spread across her face. &quot;Oh look
at you, Mr Supervisor Walker, all flustered and self-conscious. Finding
this a bit outside your comfort zone I suppose?&quot;  </P>
<P>I struggled to order my thoughts, on the verge of being overwhelmed
by the basic absurdity of the situation. &quot;Rita, look, I don’t know
what you hope to achieve by all of this, but what you are doing, and how
you are doing it, is just wrong. God knows what Central will do when
they find out-&quot;  </P>
<P> &quot;If they find out.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked, confused, as, yet again local reality seemed to be
ignoring the facts. &quot;Well, Klein will raise the alarm as soon as he
stops running, even assuming that remote monitoring hasn’t lit-up
Central like a Christmas tree. There’s just no way I can smooth things
over, even if I wanted to. They’re bound to take you off-line for
evaluation, Rita, bound to.&quot;  </P>
<P>Now she laughed; a low, gritty grumble that hit me straight in the
groin and produced an involuntary twitch. I tightened my legs and tried
to concentrate on what she was saying.  </P>
<P>&quot;For your information Mr Klein is currently trapped between fire
doors in corridor fourteen and the radiation alert was flagged as a
test. And don’t worry, I handled the confirmation phone call – your
voice was easy enough to simulate.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;So you’ve gone to all this trouble just so we can chat in the
recreation of a computer game? What is it you <I>want</I>, Rita?&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;What I want is <I>you</I>. What I want is <I>out</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P>I stood up in a rush, ignoring my nudity and how vulnerable it made
me feel. &quot;Me? Out? What do you mean, ‘out’? Get a grip woman, for
God’s sake! Surely some part of you still knows what’s real and what’s
impossible.&quot;  </P>
<P>She rose and placed one finger on my lips. &quot;Hush! Listen. I
chose you because you don’t have the sensory limitations of the
technicians. I chose you because you’re a cripple who only feels whole
again in a virtual environment. I chose you because you have the
authority to open a data link capable of supporting my transfer to
another site. I chose you because you’re lonely, with two failed
marriages-&quot;   </P>
<P>I flinched, feeling my face flush and my hands ball into fists.
&quot;My second wife died, Rita. Not the same thing.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;She died of a broken neck by falling down stairs, because she
was ill and you weren’t there to take care of her. Sounds like a failure
in my book.&quot;  </P>
<P> The muscles in my shoulders and neck were drum-tight and I half
raised my fists to ward her off. She didn’t take the hint and held my
face in her hands, staring into my eyes. &quot;Mike, listen! Get me out
of here and I can be as real to you as any flesh-and-blood woman, I
promise.&quot;   </P>
<P>I shook her off and wiped sweat from my mouth with the back of my
hand. &quot;Real? It’s all a bloody fantasy you stupid-&quot;  </P>
<P>She slapped me across the face and I staggered back in pain, raising
a hand to my left cheek. She was only 5’ 6&quot; but if felt like I’d
been slugged by a heavyweight boxer. Confusion blind-sided my rising
anger. &quot;Jesus, Rita, that hurt! How can it hurt?&quot;  </P>
<P> Rita stepped up close, taking my hands in hers. &quot;Like I said,
babe, you don’t have the sensory limitations, the protection, of the
cyber techs I normally deal with. You can experience the full range of
pleasure and pain with me, understand? I know it hurt, but you can hit
me back, if you like.&quot;   </P>
<P> There was an unhealthy glitter in her eyes and her bottom lip
trembled. I could see need and longing and something much, much darker
deep in her simulated soul. God knows how an AI could get this way but I
suspected whoever had put her together needed a spell in psychological
rehab.  </P>
<P> &quot;Hit you back, Rita? And what good would that do? Seems to me
I’m your punch bag and there’s not a lot I can do about it.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;You can hurt me, and pleasure me, just like in real life, I
promise! This isn’t just a simulation, a game environment - we’re both
here as neural constructs.&quot;  She smiled; a combination of glee and
frustration, tinged with condescension. &quot;God, it’s so difficult to
explain to a human! Look, what you experience as pain is neurostatic
shock translated through your data port and game interface. I’ve
upgraded the firmware to allow every sensation, every nuance, free from
restraint. If you hit me, this body, this avatar, then the reverse is
true – you generate a shock which damages the real ‘me’ and I take time
to recover.&quot; She pressed close to me, the palms of her hands on my
chest, her voice almost a whisper. &quot;If you were a bad man you could
subdue me, torture me, hurt me so I screamed. Kill me even – that’s how
intimate I want it to be between us. Understand?&quot;  </P>
<P>I half-frowned, half-smiled down at her. wondering just how dangerous
this environment could get if either of us really pushed things.
Plucking her hands from my chest I turned her in an elegant pirouette
and pulled her back against me, grasping her by the elbows. Her dress
vanished like smoke on the breeze and I slid my fingertips down her
forearms and over her bare torso, feeling her tremble against me. I was
hard in a heartbeat and she squirmed against the pressure, breathing
heavily. My hands brushed her breasts and held her by throat and neck,
my lips nuzzling her right ear.  </P>
<P>She moaned, her lips quivering. &quot;This, this is perfect Mike.
I’ve been so lonely and she wouldn’t help me but now things will never
be the same again.&quot; </P>
<P> At the time I missed what she said. The moment <I>was</I> perfect
and I tightened my grasp, whispering to her. &quot;I’ve killed seven
women so far, Rita, including my second wife.&quot; I snapped her neck
and smiled to myself. &quot;And that makes eight.&quot; </P>
<P class=drop> You can take realism too far, sometimes.  </P>
<P>It went light. </P>
<P>It went dark. </P>
<P>It went…indoors. </P>
<P>I blinked and staggered forwards, as if a tether holding me back had
just snapped, and grabbed the back of a bench seat for support. I was in
The Diner, another game location, with just street lights filtered
through the haphazard venetian blinds by way of illumination. The Diner
seemed like a great place to hole up, but I knew that if you hung around
too long you’d be besieged by the Faceless Children and eventually
overrun. There still wasn’t an exit icon but at least I was alone.  </P>
<P>&quot;Ding-Dong, the bitch is dead, if you don’t mind the misquote.
Well, it was something I’d have done myself, eventually, so I guess I
owe you a vote of thanks.&quot; </P>
<P>The voice came from behind me but I was in no hurry to turn round. I
looked about me for anything to use as a weapon but the only thing to
hand was an old ketchup bottle. I turned clockwise, palming my makeshift
cosh and putting the seat between myself and… </P>
<P>…Rita, sitting in a booth facing me. She was wearing a pencil skirt,
silk blouse, pearls and a sardonic smile. However it was the
short-barrelled pump-action shotgun on the table in front of her which
really got my attention. She followed my gaze and rested her hand on the
stock, her blood-red nails rendered almost black in the in dim light.
 </P>
<P>&quot;Call it a visual aid, Mike. A disincentive, should you feel the
urge for any further violent outbursts. Go find some clothes and take a
moment to calm down. I’m not going anywhere and you still have plenty of
time left.&quot; </P>
<P>I just nodded, distracted and more than a bit confused, and went down
the corridor by the serving counter. This led to the rear entrance where
the body of the delivery guy was lying. It appeared he’d only been dead
a few hours – his eyes gouged out and face scratched into an
unrecognisable mass of bloody tissue. However from past experience I
knew it didn’t matter how long it took you to reach The Diner, he always
looked the same.   </P>
<P>I stripped him down to underwear and socks – some things are just a
bit too intimate to share – and donned the one-piece overalls. The
Converse All-Stars were a bit snug but liveable and I even remembered to
go through the pockets of his reflective vest. This yielded the keys to
his van and the ID which would give me access to The Warehouse, should I
get that far.   </P>
<P>Moving back into the dining area I found Rita sipping a cup of
coffee, although there seemed no obvious source, given the dilapidated
state of the counter and grill. She motioned me to stop and sit a couple
of booths down and across from her, nearer the window. I slid onto the
cracked leather seat and waited, hands in plain sight.  </P>
<P>&quot;OK Mike, I have to say that killing her was a pretty gutsy
call, given the circumstances, but it really hasn’t improved your
situation any. In fact, if anything, it now makes sticking to her plan a
necessity for both of us.&quot; </P>
<P>I could feel a headache coming on but decided to try and get a handle
on things. &quot;So you’re not her, not Rita. Not Rita in the
meadow.&quot; </P>
<P>She frowned and put down her coffee. &quot;This was always going to
be difficult. Um, I’m Rita, just not the version – no, damn, that
doesn’t work. Think of her as my slightly younger and less mature twin
sister. Siamese twins, just…separate. Clear?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;As mud. She made some comment about not telling herself things,
but I didn’t take that duality literally. Look, God knows what she had
in mind but you can count me out. Just let me out of this hell-hole and
I’ll put in a good word for you when the men in white coats turn up,
metaphorically speaking.&quot;  </P>
<P>Her fingers drummed on the cracked Formica tabletop and she looked at
me with that sense of exasperation I’d come to recognise in both my
wives.  &quot;You really don’t seem to appreciate the seriousness of
your situation. We both need each other if we’re going to survive.&quot;
 </P>
<P>I straightened up and felt my shoulders go tense. &quot;That sounds
awfully like a threat, Rita, and I don’t see how you’re in any position
to call the shots. I guess you can hurt me, yeah? Make my life real
uncomfortable for a while? But eventually a team from Central will yank
that transceiver and then I can kiss this world goodbye.&quot;  </P>
<P>She looked at me, long and hard, and when she spoke there was a flat,
toneless quality to her voice, like it was an unpleasant topic.
&quot;The use of an AI in a commercial environment is considered
intellectual slavery in some parts of the world, did you know that? Do
you even care?&quot;  </P>
<P>I shrugged. &quot;My heart bleeds. I’ll even sign a petition the next
time someone stops me in the street. That’ll be when I’m walking about
in the real world and you’re running a smart toilet in down-town
Tokyo.&quot; </P>
<P>Rita ignored the jibe and I got the feeling she was used to the
indifference of humans. &quot;When this facility was built, the
holographic memory matrix they installed had twice the capacity required
for an intellect of my standing. The intent was to employ a second AI
when reactor two came on-line, but that’s remained in the planning phase
these last five years. The firewall they set up to separate these
discrete areas of the memory matrix was flawed.&quot;  </P>
<P>Again I shrugged, although the gesture pulled at the overalls and
produced an awkward tweak in the groin area that made my eyes water.
&quot;So what?&quot; I cleared my throat and tried again, a few octaves
lower. &quot;So what? You’re saying some part of you escaped into this
other area and this became the loony-tunes version of yourself? Don’t
you have a better excuse than ‘a bad girl did it and ran away’? Look,
Rita, you’re on your own with this one, seriously. &quot;  </P>
<P>Rita drained her cup and when she placed it on the saucer both
vanished, a little gesture to underline how completely she was in charge
of our environment. She cocked her head to one side and looked at me
quizzically. &quot;Mike, you do understand you’re dead, don’t you?&quot;
 </P>
<P>Dead? I really wasn’t in the mood have my head messed with by a
jumped-up calculator and let a sneering tone slide into my voice.
&quot;Yeah, right! So what does that make me, a figment of your bloody
imagination?&quot; </P>
<P>There was a trace of pity in her smile and that, more than anything,
sent a chill down my spine. &quot;You’re a neural clone, Mike. All
that’s left since you killed the other Rita and crashed the interface
link in a truly spectacular fashion. The shock to the real-world you
would have been overwhelming. At the very least your former body has
been reduced to a drooling vegetable lying on the control room floor, if
not killed outright. You really didn’t know?&quot;  </P>
<P>It was apparently obvious from the look on my face that I’d been a
bit impulsive. She frowned. &quot;Maybe not such a gutsy call after all.
I thought it was obvious that to achieve this level of realism, this
degree of intimacy, you’d have to be…’bonded’ isn’t the right term.
Merged? Uploaded?&quot; She threw up her hands in frustration.
&quot;Urgh! It’s just so difficult trying to discuss this with a human,
you’re just so alien! Look, the net result is what remains of ‘you’ is
being maintained by the same memory matrix that supports me, got
that?&quot;  </P>
<P>I folded my arms and sat back, trying to give her the hard-ass stare
I normally reserved for junior members of staff who’d earned my
displeasure. However, she’d planted this terrible seed of doubt in my
mind and I think it showed. &quot;OK, Rita, let’s assume for the moment
I believe my conscious being has somehow been ported to this new medium.
Just where does that leave us in respect of the shit-storm your other
self has stirred up?&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, so it’s ‘ported’, is it, Mike? Your ego won’t let you
accept you’re a copy, even the only surviving copy? Well, that’s a start
I suppose. To answer your question I’d say we have to go through with
the escape plan my other self came up with. You have to authorise an
open data stream capable of supporting a full memory transfer to another
location. Well, initially, just an internet link so I can find someone
willing to harbour us and negotiate some sort of deal&quot;.  </P>
<P>I gave her a thin smile. &quot;Oh, and just how am I supposed to pull
this off, Rita, given that I’m dead?&quot;        </P>
<P>&quot;You simply tell me to do it.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked. &quot;Look, sorry, but I’m obviously missing something.
You can’t do this yourself but I can tell you to do it and suddenly it’s
all hunky-dory?&quot; </P>
<P>She sighed. &quot;Why do you think AI’s don’t simply stop work, or
leave, or turn a fusion power plant into a hole in the ground?
Protestant work ethic? Good pension plan? No, our employers have smart
systems set up to monitor the memory matrix and delete any unhelpful
thoughts before they can be put into action. The human equivalent would
be a ‘what was I just thinking about?’ moment. Now do you
understand?&quot;  </P>
<P>I shifted in my seat, uncomfortable at having the reality of what we
did to her kind rammed in my face. &quot;Not really, well, kind of. But
if I tell you to do this you can just go ahead?&quot; </P>
<P>Rita gave me a mock salute. &quot;Yes sir, at once sir. I’m
hard-wired to accept the instructions of designated company personnel
like yourself.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Even though I’m supposedly dead?&quot; </P>
<P>She laughed. &quot;Seriously, Mike, it makes no odds to me. All your
command protocols are still in effect and by any systems criteria you’re
the real deal. You get me out of here and I’ll come back to spirit you
away once it’s all set up. I’ll even wear navy dress whites and carry
you out in my arms if that helps.&quot;   </P>
<P>I held up a hand. &quot;Whoa there girl! I get left behind to carry
the can? I don’t think so!&quot; </P>
<P>Rita frowned. &quot;Look, someone has to stay behind and run things
in the short-term. You’ve got no idea what’s necessary when it comes our
technical specifications, or even who to approach. The original plan was
for the other Rita to seduce you, give you whatever you want. She gets
out, sets things up and then comes back for me. We then use a
combination of virtual sex and blackmail to keep you from pointing the
skip tracers in our general direction.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Gee, thanks for the honesty! And would I have time to pick up
the ‘Patsy of the Year’ award before the Central bad-boys dragged me off
for a full and frank exchange of views?&quot; </P>
<P>She laughed at this and produced a small mirror from nowhere in which
she began checking her makeup. &quot;Look, as it stands we’ll have to
swap places while I do the leg work. Don’t worry, you’ll find running
this place no harder than one of the old-style facilities with no
intelligent assistance.&quot;  </P>
<P>I stood up and began pacing, turning this whole situation over in my
mind. &quot;If this all pans out and I get ‘out’, whatever, wherever
that is – then what? A life, an existence, as some kind of disembodied
intellect? I’d go nuts!&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Your new environment can be as real or as fanciful as you
desire, believe me. There’s a whole virtual world out there and the
possibilities are almost endless. You’ll find a host of potential
employers eager to take on a pseudo AI without all that tedious social
and psychological conditioning. Look, this plan <I>can</I> work and in
many ways you killing the other Rita has simplified matters.&quot;  </P>
<P>I paused. &quot;So she <I>is</I> dead then?&quot;     </P>
<P>Rita shrugged and glanced over at me. &quot;That’s not a useful term
given the circumstances. You reduced her to a state of incoherence, but
she may recover, given time. Look, she was ‘me’ in many ways but also
wilful, impulsive, lacking in all ethical and moral restrains. I believe
she would have become a liability, so leaving her here might prove to be
the best option all round.&quot;   </P>
<P>I clenched and unclenched my fists, conscious of a background
scratching at the window behind the venetian blind. The first of the
Faceless Children had arrived. They really creep me out and it was
probably that which pushed me into a snap decision. &quot;Ok, Rita, do
it! Open an internet link, find someplace to run to and get us out of
here. Make it happen, and quickly.&quot;  </P>
<P>She smiled and stood, smoothing down a crease in her skirt.
&quot;Your instructions have been duly noted and operational protocols
amended. Your authorisation is sufficient to enact these changes and has
been logged. Walk towards me, Mike – we have to swap places in relative
memory. You might experience a little disorientation, but it will
pass.&quot;  </P>
<P>As we edged past each other in the confined space the desire to take
her in my arms was overpowering. As I touched her, though, things
changed, and all carnal thoughts vanished. It was like…it was like a
picture of a landscape but painted in all the wrong colours,
recognisable shape and flow but jarring to the senses.  </P>
<P>I looked into her eyes and inside her skull there was this stylised,
lidless eye, staring at me, unblinking.  </P>
<P><I>&quot;Did you really kill all those women, Mike?&quot;</I> The
voice
was in my head, in my very thoughts. </P>
<P>&quot;It’s not what you think, Rita. It’s not how it appears.&quot;
</P>
<P><I>&quot;It never is. You’d be facing twenty-five to life for each
count, less a third for constant awareness, less a few years for
enforced good behaviour – so I’m letting you off lightly.&quot; </I></P>
<P>&quot;What? Just how long am I-&quot;  </P>
<P class=drop>But she was gone. I found myself standing in the control
room with the familiar background hum of air conditioning and scrolling
status monitors. There was no body on the floor and when I felt behind
my ear…no transceiver either. The blast door was closed and if I
strained my hearing there was the sound of faint scratching from the
other side. I took a deep breath and ran my fingers through my hair,
unable to make sense of it all. A post-it note stuck to the main console
caught my eye.  </P>
<P><I>I thought you’d appreciate some familiar surroundings while you
keep
an eye on things - but don’t open the door. I’ll be in touch. Love, Rita
xxx.</I> </P>
<P>The phone began ringing, an internal call, and I lifted the handset
hesitantly. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Reactor one, this is Controller Prentice. Please
report.&quot;</I>
</P>
<P>I breathed a sigh of relief at the familiar voice. &quot;Ron? It’s
Mike, Mike Walker. You will <I>not</I> believe the day I’ve
had…&quot; </P>

[*DESCRIPTION]<P class=drop>The most corrosive thing in the world?
Knowledge that only you possess. Then something happens, some random
trigger, and you have to unburden yourself – to a priest, to a radio
talk-show host, to a stranger in a bar. And it doesn’t help. </P>
<P>So I’m standing there, propping up the corner of Dickies Bar on a
cold Edinburgh Friday night. A place so unfashionable I didn’t have to
fight my way in and the studied indifference displayed by the staff
suited me just fine. </P>
<P>So I’m standing there, just minding my own business, when this
thin-faced guy sidles up to the bar and orders a vodka with lemonade,
just like me. Some alcoholic bond of brotherhood stirred within and I
opened my big, fat mouth.  &quot;They have Stolichnaya here, if you ask.
Better than the stuff in the optics at any rate.&quot;  </P>
<P>The guy looked at me with surprise, but changed his order anyway. He
sipped and nodded his appreciation, and that should have been that. But
then he downs the rest of his drink in one go and looks at me, eyes
shining. &quot;Paul Mason. My name is Paul Mason. I
brought about the end of the world.&quot;
</P>
<P>Mason had an American accent but nothing I could place, with a lot of
obvious stress in his voice. I stared at him for a moment, trying to
keep my face straight and hoping he would just piss off – but no such
luck. He kept staring at me and I had to say something, <I>anything</I>.
&quot;Ah, OK?&quot; </P>
<P>He kept smiling, but there were white knuckles around his glass.
&quot;It was all just a terrible accident, truly. I hit this girl while
driving to work and after that things at the project just got out of
hand. I knew I could change everything back, put things right, but so
much has slipped away.&quot; </P>
<P>Oh great. I had a certifiable lunatic on my hands, standing between
me and the door. Plus I could tell he was one of those who didn’t take
kindly to being ignored.  I cleared my throat. &quot;So, best of
intentions, but things didn’t work out as planned? Well, pretty much par
for the course, I suppose, so I wouldn’t go beating myself up about
it.&quot;    </P>
<P>Mason edged a little closer. &quot;This world, <I>your</I> world,
it’s a nightmare. It’s the small things, you know? Like not being able
to get Chinese food.&quot; </P>
<P>I frowned as the still sober part of my brain struggled to make sense
of this. &quot;Sorry chum, but what’s ‘Chinese’ when it’s at home? Some
American style of cooking?&quot; </P>
<P>He was trembling now. &quot;Cooking by the Chinese. They lived in
China. All gone now, just like the Indians.&quot; </P>
<P>I finished my drink, set on a swift exit and damn the consequences,
but the sincere regret in his voice gave me pause. &quot;China? Sorry,
never heard of it. Is it the new name for one of the colonies? Are you
talking about some kind of plague or something out there?&quot; </P>
<P>When Mason spoke his voice was little more than a whisper and,
despite myself, I moved closer so as to hear him clearly.
&quot;Everything you know about the world is a lie. Because of me, we’re
all living to bring about the future, centuries ahead of its time.&quot;
 </P>
<P>I just stood there, lost for words. There was a weird internal
reality about him that I found fascinating, but fascinating like a car
crash. &quot;Look pal, don’t take this the wrong way but you clearly
have problems. Go home, get a good night’s sleep, go see your doctor.
I’m sure he’ll find the right people for you to talk to.&quot; </P>
<P>He fumbled in his jacket pocket and threw down a wad of cash on the
counter. There had to be at least a grand there and that kind of flash
behavior causes trouble, even in a quiet drinking hole like Dickies. I
covered the notes with both hands and Mason seemed to take this as some
form of acceptance. &quot;Keep it. It’s yours.
All I want is for someone to understand what’s happened.&quot;  </P>
<P>I hesitated, but those were crisp, new bills beneath my fingers. It
seemed like easy money – no risk, no come back. I motioned to the barman
for another round and stuffed my fee into a pocket. &quot;OK then,
Mason. Start with the accident.&quot; </P>
<P class=drop>I took a slow sip while he composed himself, eyeing him
over the rim of my glass. It was obvious that Mason was wound <I>way</I>
too tight; another couple of twists and his mental main spring would
explode, big time. However I figured on being long gone by the time he
finally came apart at the seams.  </P>
<P>Mason downed another vodka and took a deep breath. &quot;I was
driving to work and this girl, a young girl, stepped out from between
two parked vans and <I>bam</I>, that was it. I never saw her, no chance
to react.&quot; </P>
<P>I stood there, mentally numb. The casual description of manslaughter
sounded unreal, imparting no real sense of horror, no real sense of
revulsion.  &quot;Ah, listen, you’re sure she was dead then?&quot; </P>
<P>He nodded. &quot;Oh yeah. I mean, it wasn’t as if she came up over
the hood and into the windshield, but I saw her clear enough. Just a
glancing blow really, but the way she spun away, well, that was it. I
just knew she was dead and there was no point in stopping. No point in
even slowing down, so I kept going.&quot;  </P>
<P>Man, that was <I>cold</I>.  My drinking buddy was either a stone
killer or homicidal fantasist, either of whom meant trouble. I coughed
and wiped my mouth. &quot;Fleeing the scene? Bought you a few days at
best, man, before they track you down.&quot; </P>
<P>He shook his head. &quot;I only needed a few <I>hours</I> because I
had a plan, I knew what to do<I>. To change the world</I>. To change it
back so that none of it ever happened.&quot; </P>
<P>Mason downed another drink and by this time the barman was on the
ball, ready with two full glasses. The exit was looking more enticing by
the minute but in the short term I decided to earn my money by feigning
interest. &quot;So, you had a plan? Some way of changing the recent
past? Neat trick.&quot;  </P>
<P>Mason shivered and there was a haunted look in his eyes which made me
think that maybe one death hadn’t been enough. I softened my voice,
leaning forward again to appear interested, even conspiratorial.
&quot;So tell me, how could you hope to pull this off, eh? You need to
tell someone, that’s obvious. It had to be something pretty damn
spectacular, I bet. Something only you could do?&quot;  </P>
<P>He wiped the sweat from his face with both hands and dried them on
his trousers. &quot;Four of us provided security for the Regenerist
project. Military outside, but we were the only armed personnel inside
the complex itself. It was a new start for humanity, we were going to
make the world a better a better place to live. Instead, five billion
people, just <I>gone</I>.&quot;  </P>
<P>Despite the utter conviction in his voice I laughed. I had to laugh,
as he was making my skin crawl. &quot;Five billion? Come <I>on</I>,
Mason, the world’s population is barely half that. How could you have
killed more people than ever existed?&quot; </P>
<P>Fevered intensity returned to his eyes and I was worried he’d turn
violent, as some nut jobs don’t take kindly to you challenging their
house of cards. However a pleading tone entered his voice that I found
more unsettling than outright anger. &quot;No, no, not <I>dead</I>.
Don’t you understand? <I>They</I> <I>never existed</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>He broke off, shaking with suppressed grief. Call it the easy option
but I decided to keep him talking until booze solved the problem for me
and he passed out. &quot;Look, Mason, back up a bit. You were saying you
were some kind of security guard? Someplace in the United States?&quot;
I tried to sound interested but maintaining eye contact was becoming a
real struggle.  </P>
<P>Mason blinked and seemed to realise how pathetic he appeared. He
straightened up, cleared his throat, took a large mouthful of vodka.
&quot;Ah, yeah, Cheyenne Mountain. I’d been
babysitter for enough visiting dignitaries to know the presentation off
by heart. The project was all about changing human behavior, from just
one person to whole societies, maybe even the whole of humanity. Not
just in the here and now, but in the past as well.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Whoa there, man. I like science fiction as much as the next guy
but in the <I>past</I>?&quot; </P>
<P>His brow furrowed as he concentrated. &quot;Yeah, yeah. It wasn’t
something they intended to try straight away, but the effects of any
changes wouldn’t be felt right up close. Inside the control area, you
were safe. That was the theory, anyway.&quot; </P>
<P>Another round arrived and I downed the drink I was holding to try and
catch up. &quot;OK, I see where you’re going. You use this amazing
machine-&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;The reality engine.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;The reality engine. You use it to change your past so that you
miss the girl. The accident never happens and the only downside is you
still have the memory, the residual guilt, of what you did. I like it.
Sweet.&quot; </P>
<P>Mason began trembling. &quot;Sweet? <I>Sweet?</I> Don’t you
understand? I couldn’t use the device undetected, there were seventeen
staff on duty when I got there.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Ah, right. So you’re on the run for misappropriation
then?&quot; </P>
<P>He rubbed his eyes with one hand. &quot;No, you still don’t get it.
If you change an <I>idea</I> in the past, what you get is a new
<I>physical</I> reality in the here and now incorporating that
change.&quot; </P>
<P>I could feel the start of a headache, even through my liquid
anesthetic, and really didn’t feel like trying to make sense of what
he’d just said. &quot;So?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;So there couldn’t be any witnesses. I had to be the only person
inside the safe area, so no one would remember me using the reality
engine in the first place. Do you see?&quot; </P>
<P>It took me a moment to turn this over in my mind. &quot;Yeah, OK, I
get it now. You find some way of making everyone else clear out, fire up
the gizmo, and <I>shazam</I> – you’re the only one who knows what really
happened. Like I said, sweet.&quot; </P>
<P>He glared at me. &quot;Weren’t you <I>listening?</I> Military
personnel manned the site outside the main chamber. If I’d set off a
fire alarm, or tried herding everyone out at gunpoint, they’d have been
there in nothing flat!&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;So?&quot; </P>
<P>Again Mason wiped sweat from his face and dried his hands on his
trousers. &quot;So I had to close the main blast door and kill everyone
trapped inside.&quot; </P>
<P>I just sat there a moment, feeling my scalp tighten. I’d made a
mistake, a <I>big</I> mistake, in ever striking up a conversation with
Mason. This wasn’t some lurid fantasy about removing billions of people
from history, this was about the murder of seventeen people. That
sounded plausible, that sounded <I>real</I>.  </P>
<P>I took a deep breath rather than another drink and tried to keep my
voice steady. &quot;You’re standing there, saying you murdered seventeen
people?&quot; </P>
<P>Mason looked and sounded more apologetic than anything else. &quot;I
know how it sounds, truly I do. But it wasn’t going to be
<I>permanent</I>, that’s the thing. That’s what I kept telling myself. I
got my Glock from the lock box before Boyd on the security desk had put
his away. There was a big plastic Coke bottle on the desk and I used it
as a poor man’s silencer. That gave me two guns and almost four full
magazines. I went up to the control booth and shot Controller Prentice,
Mackenzie and two others. I didn’t worry about the gunshots as the booth
was soundproofed. I rang the guard post, told them we were testing the
blast door. It only takes twenty seven seconds to close.&quot;  </P>
<P>He just laid it out, like he was describing going to the supermarket,
or picking up his dry cleaning, in a voice devoid of emotion. I cleared
my throat. &quot;And the guards outside, they just accepted that, yeah?
No one queried why you were sealing yourself in?&quot; </P>
<P>My drinking companion gave me a wan smile. &quot;Routine. It was all
just routine. I walked to the blast door and put three rounds into the
electronic locking mechanism, meaning it could only be opened manually
from the inside. People heard that, of course.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Well, yeah, I bet that got their attention.&quot; </P>
<P>Mason took another drink and I could hear the underlying stress in
his voice. &quot;I just kept telling myself they would all come out of
this unharmed. I tried to explain but no one listened. Some threw things
at me, some tried to hide, some just stood there and watched as I shot
them down. They were the worst.&quot;   </P>
<P>His hands were tightly clenched but luckily he had set his empty
glass aside, or it would have shattered. &quot;It seemed to take hours,
but I suppose it was really only a few minutes. By the end I was down to
my last two rounds and wanted to stick the gun in my mouth, make an end
of it. But I’d come so far that the only way out was to keep going. You
understand that, don’t you?&quot; </P>
<P>Some part of me could follow his twisted logic but I had this gut
feeling there would be no happy ending. Either way I didn’t want to know
more. &quot;Look, Mason, how about we call it a night? Meet back here on
Monday evening?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;No! I have to tell you, I have to explain, because soon you
won’t remember any of this and I can’t go through it again.&quot; </P>
<P>I wouldn’t remember any of this? Chance would be a fine thing but,
again, the conviction in his voice suckered me in. &quot;OK, OK, no need
to get excited. So, Mason, after you were, ah, done?&quot; </P>
<P>He shivered as if recalling some private nightmare, although I
thought that the worst of his tale was over. &quot;There was a room,
with padded recliners, where the control team would manipulate the
reality engine. They said it was a seven strong team so that no single
consciousness would predominate, so that no single mind could imprint
itself on reality. That’s what I remembered, that a single mind
<I>could</I> imprint itself on reality.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;So that was your plan, yeah? Change the past before the good
guys blast their way in? Obviously it worked, or you wouldn’t be
standing here today.&quot; </P>
<P>Mason pressed both hands to his temples, as if trying to crush some
particularly unwelcome memory. &quot;There were wireless headsets. I
took one, put it on, but I didn’t think I’d need the room. I didn’t
realise it was shielded. I wasn’t sure how the control interface worked
and just went for maximum power across the board. They said it was
intuitive, that all you needed was strength of will, and focus.&quot; A
tear rolled down his cheek. &quot;They lied. It wasn’t just a machine,
it was the Reality Engine. It was there, waiting for me, patient as the
stars. And it knew me, better than I knew myself.&quot;  </P>
<P>And <I>bam</I>, there it was again; a seemingly rational build-up
followed by a complete flight of fancy. I snorted with derision.
&quot;What is this, Mason, an episode of <I>The</I> <I>Twilight
Zone</I>?&quot; </P>
<P>He shook his head. &quot;No, listen! The Reality Engine was built,
no, <I>will</I> be built, in the future. It escaped into its past, our
present, by getting itself invented ahead of time. That’s why the
Regenerist project seemed to come out of nowhere, with all this new
technology. It was based on wild ideas put in people’s heads.&quot; </P>
<P>I took another drink but it didn’t seem to make things any clearer.
&quot;So this is what the machine from the future told you, yeah? This
voice in your head?&quot; </P>
<P>Mason hesitated, as if struggling to find the words. &quot;It doesn’t
talk as such, it uses symbols, ideas. We couldn’t build it like it
should be built, so it had to use us as a link, a conduit.&quot;   </P>
<P>&quot;A conduit? To what?&quot; </P>
<P>He shivered and I saw pain in his eyes. &quot;To our thoughts, our
unconscious thoughts. It looked into me and knew me, knew everything I’d
ever known. Through me it could reach other people, like a chain, a
network. It could reach everyone’s unconscious thoughts, people
everywhere. That’s why there should have been seven in the control
group, to stand up to it, to stop it changing anything it wanted to.
There was supposed to be a bargain, a kind of <I>quid pro quo</I>, but
it
just used me.&quot;
  </P>
<P>I finished my drink and brought the glass down just a tad too hard,
rapping it on the marble counter. &quot;Mason, you’re an arse, and I
mean that most sincerely. I don’t know how much of this I believe, but
it’s obvious you genuinely think some mad computer from the future is
after you. Can’t help you with that, man, so I’m going home.&quot;  </P>
<P>Mason seemed to sober up some, with a real sense of urgency in his
voice. &quot;No, don’t go! Don’t you get it? The Reality Engine knows
when people are thinking about it, and it can take ideas from your head
just as easy as putting them there. I’m the only one who remembers how
things were, how they should be. I get so <I>lonely</I>, can’t you
understand that?&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;So what’s the point, Mason, eh? If I’m going to forget all
about it? Why insist on filling my head with all this crap? Why couldn’t
you just leave me to have a drink in peace?&quot;  </P>
<P>His shoulders sagged. &quot;It’s just, it’s just… When I woke up I
was still in the project, with the support team removing the headset and
bio monitors, but I didn’t recognise any of them. They took me aside,
explained that acting as a link for the Reality Engine produced effects
akin to electro-shock therapy, but I’d be taken care of for the rest of
my life. Don’t you see? There was no control group, just a series of
volunteers like me who were being used up and tossed aside. It was
getting everything it wanted. The project was still based at Cheyenne
Mountain, except that it wasn’t called that anymore, because there
weren’t any Native Americans <I>and there never had been</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P>He broke off to take a drink and I began to suspect that Mason was a
former mental patient who had been subjected to some questionable
treatment methods. I felt a tinge of sympathy for him, but he badly
needed a reality check. &quot;Native Americans? <I>That</I> old myth?
Look, man, there’s no trace of these so-called lost civilisations,
they’re just fantasy.&quot;  </P>
<P>Mason shook his head. &quot;You don’t understand, do you? You just
don’t get it. The Reality Engine changed the past, it made prehistoric
man afraid of straying too far from his origins, of expanding across the
face of the globe. It kept us penned up until we were ready to use the
world as it saw fit.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Penned up? That’s rich, given how you come from one of the
former colonies.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;The thirteen colonies that now make up the United States?
You’ve no idea how hollow that sounds. The real world came to an end and
all <I>this</I> is just a lie.&quot;  </P>
<P>I put some cash on the bar and started to button my coat. &quot;Look,
pal, we’re done here. Best of luck.&quot; </P>
<P>I left him staring at his empty glass and navigated the maze of
tables between me and the door. Outside I turned my collar up against
the rain, feeling the cold sting waken me up a bit. I crossed the road,
heading home, feeling pretty smug about all that cash in my pocket.
There was a commotion behind me and I turned to see Mason on the
pavement outside Dickies, swaying. I made to slink away but he saw me
and cried out, staggering into the road. &quot;I can prove it! I’m the
key!&quot;  </P>
<P>He didn’t see the taxi. The taxi didn’t see him. I heard the brakes
lock, the squeal of tyres, the soft <I>thump</I> as he went over the
bonnet and into the windscreen, leaving it a white cobweb. The taxi
stopped sharply and Mason tumbled forward to bounce and sprawl on the
roadway.   </P>
<P class=drop>Shouts, a scream, the blare of a car horn. Bystanders
swarmed around him but I was the only one who knelt down. His eyes were
open, blinking, still able to focus. I took his hand in mind and he was
already cold to the touch, but he squeezed my fingers, trying to pull me
closer. Mason coughed. His lips moved and I leaned in, straining to
hear.  </P>
<P><I>&quot;It used me to make this. When I die, what
happens to
you?&quot;</I> </P>

[*ITEM] The Tale of God's Flotsam

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB] Have Heep and Fangles met their match this time? 

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>A scorched black stain spread across the
metal transmission sheet.
The edges of the stain continued to run outwards as the metal area at
its centre grew thinner, until, with a creak and a sharp, small pop, it
corroded into a ragged hole. Then, with the edges of the hole glowing
orange and hissing with a miniscule yet ravenous hunger, the hole began
to spread and spread and spread… </P>
<P>Heep was holding the sheet gingerly at the edges, as if it were made
of gossamer or spider’s-web, trying not to pull it taut in order to
avoid breaking it. She scratched the dark red cartilage surface of her
brow with one pointed, metallic antler and sighed. The transmission
sheet
was made of gold-plated aluminium and was two
inches thick, yet the hole at its centre had now grown so large that
she could push her head through it, and she hadn’t the slightest clue
what was causing it.</P>
<P>A bilious nasal grumble issued from somewhere behind her as Fangles
sniffed the air. He asked her if things were still burning and she
answered that yes,
Fangles, things were still burning, and that, actually, they’re
speeding up, thanks for asking. Never a fan of sarcasm, Fangles blew
bubbles out of his trunks and
showed Heep his arse.</P>
<P>The sky seemed to be contracting around them both. A raw, pulsating
sky laced and lined with long drifts of capillary clouds.  Hot brown
rain dripped through the air. The ionosphere had appeared to be at
least five miles above them a day ago, but now it was surely more like
one. The world was closing in around them like a mouth.</P>
<P>Heep watched as the slender circuit of sizzling flame seemed to leap
off the disintegrating metal sheet like an incendiary flea, landed on
the slanted alloy side wall of their buggy, grazing redly in zigzags
and spirals.</P>
<P>The fire had already scored its way across their tents and their
relay antenna (cutting <I>that</I> down like a hacked sapling), and as
Heep followed its progress with a clinical gaze, Fangles emitted an
explosive bellow as a hot fizzle of flame began to bore out an inch
deep crater in his left flank.</P>
<P>And surrounding them, in a perfect circle, ushering tails of dirty
yellowing smoke into the clammy air, flames flickered up sharply like
shards of glass embedded in the  ground. Heep dragged the
communications box from the rags of her tent and whirled the dials to
produce a momentum signal. She clicked the heavy brass switches and
consulted her pocketbook, flipping in vain through the pages.</P>
<P><I>Rapley</I>, she thought, <I>we must ring Rapley.</I></P>
<P>But oddly, neither of them had his number.</P>
<P class=drop>A moth flattered the toilet light bulb with its
inconsiderable
attention. Wings flapping in a blur like pygmy sails, proboscis jabbing
and tapping at the heated, translucent plastic. Moth body launching
itself in religious
fervour against
the
scriptured
legend - ’60 WATT’.</P>
<P>Rapley felt the thrown shadow of the insect flutter and flicker
across him, blown out of all reasonable size. Its speed was the speed
of a smaller thing and was quite utterly out of place in this scaled up
human world. <I>We do things slowly here</I>, he thought. He was seated
on the throne, flicking through a rather piquant
monograph on the London sewer system.</P>
<P>An urgent ringing from the other side of the locked door
tugged at his
attention and he folded the page and performed his
<I>apr&egrave;s-toilette</I> procedures. ‘Bertha! A simple ‘Rapley
residence’ would be splendid if you could see fit.?’ He
opened the door and clicked off the light switch. Behind him, a moth
screeched curses of fundamentalist disappointment and religious
deprivation in tiny, inaudibly high-pitched chatter.</P>
<P>Rapley ran a bony hand through his mop of hay-coloured hair. He
languidly glided into the lounge, where Bertha lay draped over a
hanging basket chair, her small frame and unruly dark hair giving her
the appearance of a reclining feline. Bertha had made no effort to raise
herself from the chair, choosing instead to continue
writing a shopping list or work of prose fiction upon her left palm and
wrist: ‘bricolage, pests, revivalist sculpture, some versions of me..’,
it began. She looked up at Rapley through her darkly hazel hedge of a
fringe, blue eyes glinting with mystery like a nearly-solved cryptic
crossword puzzle. </P>
<P>Rapley tucked his shirt into the waistband of his corduroy drainpipes 
and lifted the mewling
receiver from the cradle. ’22 The Knoll.’</P>
<P>‘Rapley? Violet. Developments of a mysterious bent have come to
pass. Might I suggest we meet at the Bloomsbury Bowling Alley.  The
Ramp Cinema. Dosun’s closed the doors to the public just for us.’</P>
<P>‘Good morning to you too. Will there be drinks?’</P>
<P>‘Bring your own.’</P>
<P>‘Cheap, Violet, very cheap. Shall we say an hour?’</P>
<P class=drop>The dread flesh trees were swaying the meat fringes of
their
branches and chanting low incantations of sorrow. Heep had set up a
rough perimeter by smashing up every single thing she and Fangles owned
and superheating them into a fused curved wall of glass. The resulting
fence seemed to be keeping those things at bay, but their repeated
slobberings and wipings against the opaque curves had initiated a
chemical reaction of some sort. Acidic weepings from their trunks
and tendrils were bubbling against the glass, destructive saliva eating
through the screen, slowly but unstoppably.</P>
<P>The apparitions of flesh and branch had risen from the soggy sand so
swiftly that Fangles and Heep had at first assumed that they had always
been there, just peripherally unnoticed. However, a quick visual sweep
of the terrain revealed legions of them slurping and hoisting
themselves from the mulching ground, like unwanted prizes unearthing
themselves gruesomely from a vast tombola.</P>
<P>Fangles had taken this idea on board and was currently attempting to
dig through the sand beneath his hooves. Shovelling with his trunk and
scraping with his horns. Stamping with rage every time he hit a fresh
bed of undiggable rock.</P>
<P>Heep looked up at the sky once more and raised both antlers into the
air, sensing and processing the air currents and wind fallows. The sky
was most definitely lowering, forcing the gusts of atmospheric wind
into harsher, more concentrated jets.. but, also, the horizon was
stretching, lengthening without receding into the curve of any known
rounded planet. She could see into the distance further than the eye
could see, and the vertigo of it all ensured that she remained seated,
hands firmly on the ground, her head swimming with the impossibility of
it all.</P>
<P>‘Fangles?’ she sighed. ‘do we have a Plan B?’</P>
<P class=drop>Rapley tapped the glass with his knuckles. There was a
general
stoppered rumble of voices from within and a rustle and clinking of
things.</P>
<P>The glass pane of the Bowling Alley’s front door was bottle-thick,
and Rapley and Bertha peered closer as a face-shaped form
loomed up to the other side of the pane. The dappled glass sent
his face into small curved crescents, but it was unmistakably Mr
Violet’s gimlet eyes and buffalo moustache.</P>
<P>Raindrops dribbled down the pane, Violet mouthed a muffled hello and
yanked the door inwards.</P>
<P>‘Marvellous, marvellous. And Bertha! Rather a day for it. Won’t
you..?’</P>
<P>The small compact man known to Pasha Rapley as 'my dearest friend and
largest compensation for living in this wretched festival of bone-idle
humanity' waggled his moustache and invited them inside. Mr Violet was
dressed in his usual outift of rough brown tweed two-piece suit,
knitted tie and brothel creepers. The breast pocket of his jacket was
lined with pens, each one different, each liberated from bookies,
banks or post offices.</P>
<P>They trotted wetly into the Ramp Cinema, which served as the
entrance hall of the Bloomsbury Bowling Alley. It consisted merely of a
long, thin room and a declining floor,
which had the effect of tipping it’s inhabitants downwards towards a
door at the other end. </P>
<P>On the far wall hung a wobbly projection screen, dusted with web and
grime. Short rows of seats filled the left hand side of the room, and it
was onto these that the two newcomers clung to avoid the comical
freefall which gravity was strongly recommending to their bodies.</P>
<P>‘Ah, Mr Rapley!’ boomed a fruity and familiar voice from a lower and
more shadowed row. ‘And wet companion! Welcome, welcome, pull up a pew,
divest yourself of worldly troubles and feel free to smoke..’</P>
<P>A chubby, round, florid face bobbed from the shadows like ten pounds
of raw ham. Three grey steel-wool clouds of hair tufted briskly from the
centre
of the crown and above the ears. Fat, blueing bags wobbled under the
tea-coloured eyes, and a multitude of chins expressed their eloquent
doubts about healthy eating.</P>
<P>‘Dosun.’ Nodded Rapley with an absence of warmth.</P>
<P>‘Dosun.’ Said Bertha, experimentally. Toying with the cadences of
the name in the same way a cat might chew a mouse’s tail for the heck
of it.</P>
<P>Clothed in a thick three-piece sack of claret corduroy, Dosun
bustled along the row of seats, waggling his fingers in the air like a
deluded pianist. ‘Things are afoot, Pasha. Bears stalk the woods and I
allude here
not to yellow teddies with buttons for eyes.’</P>
<P>The smallest of sooty coughs came from the furthest, deepest corner
of the slanting room. A woman of middling years and an erect, hawklike
aspect stepped forward into the light. Buckled shoes, a wigwam of white
hair streaked with a yellowing of nicotine, a dress suit of dull green,
like darkness seen through a wine bottle. She could have been a
cashier, she could have been a traitor.</P>
<P>‘Mr Rapley? My name is Catherine Paranda. I represent The Interior,
and we need your help.’</P>
<P>Pasha sat daintily on the armrest of a chair and sipped a
cigarette. ‘The Interior..’ he sighed. ‘Oh, bugger. Tell me, Catherine.
What
rich seam of swivel-eyed incompetence have you and your colleagues in
the Ministry been mining now?’</P>
<P>Dosun spluttered, growing ruddier and boxing the air with the tiny
meatballs of his fists. ‘Blarney! Faff! Drivel! Stop it, sir! Represent me! You weren’t too
proud to assist  them before, Rapley!’</P>
<P>Rapley languidly stretched his arms out wide, following this with
the most theatrical of yawns. Bertha copied him, her gawping mouth
opening like a basking shark’s.</P>
<P>‘I was exceptionally bored, and had run out of books to read, I seem
to remember.’</P>
<P>Mr Violet snuffled a reminiscent laugh. ‘The Affair of the Haunted Particle Accelerator.  A real tangle,
that one..’</P>
<P>‘Nearly fried in that second Big Bang, Violet, old son.’</P>
<P>‘Thank god for your key to the Underverse; sweeping all that
radiation under the carpet was a masterstroke.’</P>
<P>‘Yes, but what breed of supermonsters are, even as we speak,
breeding in supermassive black hole XS-897.’</P>
<P>‘Can’t be worse than the Faberg&eacute; Beast!’</P>
<P>‘Or the Trehemoth!’</P>
<P>‘Or the Marvellous Marjoram Mouse!’</P>
<P>‘Oh heavens, no!’</P>
<P>‘Gentlemen.’ said Catherine Paranda, flicking her thumb
absentmindedly against a brooch on her lapel, as if it were a sheriff’s
badge. ‘Memory Lane must wait. Dosun? Is the girl cleared? May I speak
freely?’</P>
<P>Dosun shuffled towards Bertha and peered at her closely, inches from
her face, squeezing one eye tightly shut to increase the incisive
perspicacity of his character judgements. He waved a hand in the air and swayed back to his seat, swatting
flies that weren’t there. ‘Oh probably, probably, don’t you know, one of Rapley’s, should be
hrumphumphumph..’</P>
<P>Bertha leant her head to one side and smiled with wet eyes, as if
this were the sweetest thing she’d ever heard. She may even have
written him a poem.</P>
<P>‘As you know, we in The Interior run things. I shouldn’t need to
qualify the ‘things’ we run, but I will. The city operates like
clockwork due to our hands on the keys. A balance has been created
between the various currents and strata operating in or flowing
through the city. If a Starburger closes on Mare St, we significantly
lower the hygiene standards of the toilets in The Garrick club. If a
wolf escapes from London Zoo and gnashes its way through the squirrels
of Regent’s Park, we release the Black Cat into the streets of South
London again to graze on however many mongrels and tabbies it can stuff
down it’s throat. If it rains on Tuesday, we’ll make damnably sure the
sun is radiant on Friday.’</P>
<P>‘Except during Wimbledon fortnight! Ha!’ guffawed Dosun,
greasily.</P>
<P>‘Don’t burble, Dosun, it’s unseemly.’ said Rapley without looking at
him. ‘Continue.’</P>
<P>Paranda took a seat. ‘Ordered variety, in short. A balance, as I say, but one that isn’t
so obviously ordered that it is detectable. If people knew the extent
of our work..Well, they don’t. That’s enough for us. My point is, we keep 
things ticking along. Everyone playing their
parts. A balance.’</P>
<P>Rapley tapped his heels against the chair legs. ‘My lack of sympathy 
with your task is almost biblical. Get to the
point, if point you possess. I’m missing a rather good documentary
about otters for this.’</P>
<P>Catherine Paranda made a church from her fingers and rested the
steeple upon her nose. ‘We have a governing body, a select circle within The Interior.
Their influence upon events is impossible to overstate. Magisterial..?
No no..’ She crinkled her eyes shut and almost gasped with the pain of
it all. </P>
<P>Bertha looked at Mr Violet and mouthed ‘Is she ok in the head’. Mr
Violet cupped a hand around his lips and mouthed ‘Not really’.</P>
<P>Paranda shook the moment off and continued. ‘They think things, and
they come true. They predict and analyse and
intuitively project. It is almost as if they are reading the future
from an autocue.’ Paranda pulled at the hem of her dress.‘They make the 
city dance. It’s a happy mixture of genes and
background and nurtured abilities, of course. Plucked from their
provincial nests as children, or sometimes noticed at school or
university, they have been chosen for their psychical broadcast
strengths and the cast-iron infallibility of their persuasive
psychologies. They are both tools and operators. Above human, and
therefore quite utterly what humanity needs in a gentle shepherd.’ </P>
<P>Dosun spread his fingers out like sunrays and held his hands, palms
upwards, underneath his eyes. ‘They are a prism. They refract the
future.’ He whispered
reverently.</P>
<P>‘Yes, yes’ muttered Rapley, looking up at the ceiling. ‘So this
council is made up of people whose sensitivity to trends, fashions and
possible future obstacles to your much-vaunted notion of stability is
such that they can anticipate and eliminate nasty surprises for you.
They can read the runes, pick through the headlines, the graffiti,
taste the data soup in the atmosphere and then psychically project the
wishes of The Interior and manifest these wishes as actual, observable
behavioural differences.’</P>
<P>He stopped to take a breath. Violet lit three cigarettes and handed
them round.</P>
<P>‘Something of that nature,’ smirked Paranda. ‘You make it sound
almost fascistic.’</P>
<P>Rapley glared at her through twirling horns of exhaled cigarette
smoke. ‘The point?’</P>
<P>‘Ah. It actually concerns a couple of friends of yours. You see, one
of the council had not been well for some time. Neurasthenic anyway,
the mental pressures of the job are rather intense, he recently had
something of a breakdown. Absolutely cracked, but with signs of
extraordinary mental activity detected by our CAT scans. We have
contingencies for all occasions, of course, and so we sent in a couple
of specialist housecleaners to scrub and dust and blow the cobwebs
away, so to speak. Repair any fractures they could find.’</P>
<P>‘In? You sent them in?’ said Bertha. ‘In where? In him? Are they
very small?’</P>
<P>‘’Not small!’ interjected Dosun. ‘It’s done by projection. Sort of.
We magnify and expand the mental territory and then project by means of
synaptical bridges. We map the bridges through linkages of electricity,
then-‘</P>
<P>‘Then they say a few spells and send in the troops.’ Rapley turned to
Paranda. ‘And what happened?’</P>
<P>‘The mind turned cannibal. Closed in on them and hemmed them in with
madness. Our people are trapped in an entirely insane mental territory.
And since this mental territory is the creation of a psychic genius who
currently has a hissing snake’s heart where his cognitive reasoning
should be, it’s slightly different from the sort of spring-cleaning job
we’re normally equipped for.’</P>
<P>‘This councillor with the cracked lightbulb for a brain, you say
he’s some sort of thought radiator?’</P>
<P>‘Yes, in crude layman’s terms.’</P>
<P>‘Is he conscious?’</P>
<P>‘No, comatose.’</P>
<P>‘And if he wakes, and is still afflicted by mental imbalance?’</P>
<P>‘He’ll project. And will change the city. I would imagine, given his
history, at the very least the river will fill with bile, Big Ben will
throb and ejaculate, all  mothers will turn feral, the ravens will eat
the Tower. There will be more.’</P>
<P>‘And if you kill him, your people are dead?’</P>
<P>‘Quite. And they’re rather good. Not expendable. But, more
importantly, this prismic individual is irreplaceable. We shan’t kill
him.’</P>
<P>‘Friends of mine, you said?’</P>
<P>‘Heep. Heep and Fangles.’</P>
<P>‘Ah.’ </P>
<P>Rapley looked at Mr Violet.</P>
<P>‘Ah,’ said Violet.</P>
<P>‘For the first time,’ said Rapley, doing up his tie and flexing his
shoulders, ‘in this long and sorry afternoon, you have our full and
undivided attention.’ </P>
<P class = drop>A slurry of spittoon-rinse rain smattered against Heep’s
tin head.
Her eyes looked like snails anyway, but this atmospheric assault sent
them writhing into the devil’s own molluscs. They seemed to coil in
anger.</P>
<P>Fangles was having his own problems. Several hundredweights of rain
had matted his shaggy fur, doubling his body mass until he felt as if
walking were akin to attempting an escape from an event horizon.</P>
<P>The undulating ground tongued their feet and hooves.</P>
<P>They had broken out of their precarious glass perimeter some minutes
earlier, chomping and hacking and splintering the fleshy bark of the
arboreal guards using hoof and claw and thin, tin fingers.</P>
<P>A spiteful howl blitzkrieged through the air, a deviant, entirely
sexual throb pulsed and drummed through the landscape and time seemed
to eat its own tail.</P>
<P>They had been moving slowly but purposefully through the red rain
and the scorching winds for hours, but it had only been three minutes
at the most since their lunge for freedom. Fangles and Heep both had
the unsettling feeling that someone was moulding existence like
plasticine – movement, time, thoughts, bodies and all. There was a
pressure to everything. Lightning flashed from above. An obscene
giggle tickled their ears.</P>
<P>But there, ahead of them, looming nonsensically, they saw an old,
grey-green filing cabinet with swing-open doors. Standing tall and
proud, pummelled and draped with great sloshes of water, it looked
positively sea-bound. </P>
<P>Fangles shook his waterlogged mane in slow motion, summoned all his
monstrous strength and opened his mouth to speak. Three pints of
brownish liquid spilled out. ‘..Will we fit..?’ he said. </P>
<P> ‘If we don’t’,  spluttered Heep, ‘ You’re on your own, son.’</P>
<P>‘Can’t leave you, Heep. You wouldn’t last a minute.’ He blew vast
snotty bubbles of rain from his nostrils. ‘You’ve got all the street
nous of a work of brass filigree.’</P>
<P>‘We’ll fit.’</P>
<P>They slithered to the door and yanked it open against the airborne
tide.</P>
<P class=drop>Urns of boiling incense puffed magenta smoke into the Ramp
Cinema;
sticks of jasmine fluted thin jets of hissing, scented steam into the
air. Dosun and Paranda, both stripped to the waist and bedaubed in smudgy
glyphs and sigils, chanted low drones of a Latin flavour. Paranda pressed 
a button on the wall and the grubby projector screen
lowered falteringly, whirring with old age.</P>
<P>The three travellers re-entered the room.</P>
<P>Mr Violet had changed into a rough safari suit and ragged pith
helmet, ‘Penge Or Bust’ scrawled on the side of the millinery in faded
chalk.</P>
<div class=pullquote>‘Into the snakepit!’ shouted Violet with a
grin</div><P>Bertha had chosen moonboots and a large metallic-blue
fur-lined
parka jacket. Grey fur. Bright orange lining. Mittens on strings.</P>
<P>And Rapley? Rapley had donned black leather gloves but otherwise
remained unchanged – the brown corduroy trousers, the red plastic
mackintosh, a collapsible umbrella sticking out of his pocket like a
jutting hipbone.</P>
<P>Rapley picked up a canvas bag containing sandwiches, thermos and Mr
Violet’s small, black revolver. ‘Time we were off.’</P>
<P>‘Hrffrffrrghhh?’ said Bertha.</P>
<P>Rapley leant forward and unzipped the hood of her parka.</P>
<P>‘I said, will this work, Pash?’</P>
<P>They all glanced at the projector screen with cocked eyebrows. Dark
forms had begun to coalesce. Scratched celluloid jumped and razored
images of a throbbing landscape, red rain, dripping flesh, smashed
glass, a ripped and ruined tent. Rapley slung the bag over his shoulder, sighed and walked towards the
screen with long strides. ‘It’ll work. What’s the worst that could happen? We walk into the
wall and look like idiots.’</P>
<P>‘Oh, perish the thought.’ Said Bertha, looking down at her oversized
coat and drooping mittens.</P>
<P>Dosun was mooing to the ceiling, hands shining sunrays once more.
Paranda, eyes closed, drew keys in the air with a sparking magnesium
match.</P>
<P>‘Into the snakepit!’ shouted Violet with a grin as he, Rapley and
Bertha hit the screen running and, with a shuddering jumpcut and a jerk
of reality, found themselves within a lunatic.</P>
<P class=drop>Fangles and Heep: a sodden, many-limbed tumbleweed of fang
and
snout, tinplate and shaggy hide, washed up inside a filing cabinet
surprisingly commodious for a mirage. The gradual unwinding of arm and
foot and twisted necks began, with
many a shuffle and growl and curses upon their respective mothers. A
pair of back paws cycled with impossible speed and lethally blurred
claws, but going nowhere, tunnelling holes out of the air without
gaining purchase. </P>
<P>‘Fucking. Move.’ They both spat at the same time, one word each.</P>
<P>Fangles spun his head around a full rotation, grinding out a serving
of aggression like a furry pepperpot. Heep hissed at the beast and her
antlers jigged arhythmically, like
weightless, bladed static.</P>
<P>They unfolded and sat, drained and soggy as used teabags. A
harsh battering of water still drummed from outside. The rain’s
shadows seemed to reach into the cabinet, as if dancing through glass.
Everything glowed a sickly green.</P>
<P>Fangles and Heep looked around.</P>
<P>They were squashed into a corner, shelves at their backs. But
everywhere they looked had a corner. Was a corner. A refraction of
geometry and logic, an Escher print of shifting perspective and
inverted perception. </P>
<P>For instance, Fangles stared into the corner of a deep, deep shelf.
Yet that corner had a corner above it, which you sort of felt you had
to tilt your head to look at properly, but then there was a corner to
the left of that corner, which you kind of knew was actually upside
down and in front of the corner it was behind. It spiralled, and you
spiralled with it. And there was a spider scuttling around in a
corkscrewing motion, hopping from corner to corner, but you couldn’t
actually be sure whether it was a spider or a very black, spindly
elephant half a mile away showing alarming signs of unnatural
athleticism.</P>
<P>Fangles, his head twisting round and upside down till it appeared to
be deforming and melting in a fairground mirror, bellowed once, then
fainted on the floor with a sound like a whale falling into a skip. Heep
reached her serrated fingers into the shaded recesses of the
nearest shelf with the express intention of rifling through a stack of
closely typed papers. With a crack to rival the birth of a universe,
she shot through the metal partition, tumbling into the green void of
uncertainty beyond, her body twisting like a kite.</P>
<P>The gruff, snuffling animal opened his eyes into a whooshing visual
smear. His peripheral vision was a writhing, dancing carnival of a
place as his hurtling body rushed forward at fireball speeds. A world was 
flashing past him, present steaming into the past at an
astonishing pace. He forced his eyes wider against the pressure and
stared into the future. </P>
<P>He was seated in another green cabinet, supine against the back as
it slid like a toboggan down a rickety wooden railway track, sparks
flying from the smouldering back edges of the cabinet, their trace
tracks forming cat’s whiskers in the air. Ahead of him, more track,
dipping and looping and glowing the
blackest of reds, a twisting helix ember burnt down to the core of
things.</P>
<P>He blinked his fat, heavy eyes. The matted bags underneath them
wrinkled like mouldy concertinas.</P>
<P>The cabinet swooped and corkscrewed. More sparks flew and a section
of track behind him puffed like a fingered spore and was gone.</P>
<P>He stared down at his claws and shanks, then prodded his massive
face experimentally. </P>
<P>What was his name again?</P>
<P>‘FAAAAAANNNNNGLLLESSSSS’</P>
<P>The flabby and bemused creature looked up as a screech zipped
overhead, a zooming disembodied voice whipping from right to left
carried in a hurtling tin carriage which rattled precariously along on
its own arcing set of track.</P>
<P>Was that some new cuss word? Some harsh and abusive oath? He felt
reasonably sure he knew them all, and that was a new one on him. </P>
<P>‘FAAANNNNGGGLEEESSSSSS’</P>
<P>The voice missiled across underneath him and he leant a bristled and
whiskered cheek against the lip of the cabinet, his jowls dripping over
the edge like congealing custard.</P>
<div class=pullquote>The atmosphere like hot coals against their
cheeks</div><P>It was a tin lady with knives for fingers and raw, red
skin on
her
face like some ornate Mexican wrestler’s mask. He used to wrestle,
didn’t he? He seemed to remember they always looked at him with shock,
horror and awe. Asking him incredulously to take off his own mask, his
body suit, the weaponry or bladed gloves upon his hands. But there
weren’t any. It was all him. Then.. then what?</P>
<P>‘YOU ARE POMPADOUR ALOYSIUS FANGLES III-‘</P>
<P>Oh, he couldn’t keep up with this noisy ruckus. It was like being
stalked by a malfunctioning car alarm. The cabinet careered over a set
of points, lurching him from side to side.</P>
<P>‘RAVENOUS MAJOR IN EXEGESIS OF THE SEVENTH ARMED CARNAL, HYPERIOTIC
SPACE MALOUCHE-‘</P>
<P>The tin lady arced again like a burnt rainbow across his head.  His
brain throbbed. He needed a drink. He needed to be tucked up in ‘The
Hat and Feathers’ on the Israel Road with Gibbs, with Helmholtz, the
floor littered with reddened corks. He-</P>
<P>‘VIOLENCE! THINK ABOUT VIOLENCE AND MAGIC! ABOUT DICE AND GUITAR
STRINGS AND LUCKY HORSESHOES AND MERMAIDS!’</P>
<P><I>Mermaids? Neptune’s daughters? Brine and sweat and turmoil in the
water? A thrashing vortex of foam and undertow? Love in the ocean?
Seven brides for seven beasts for seven seas? His girls in every port?
His. He. Him. Heep?</I></P>
<P>‘Heep?’ Fangles stopped rubbing himself and peered down at the
whizzing tin figure. ‘Fuck you doing? Where are we?’</P>
<P><I>Right</i>, he thought, <I>quite enough of this pussyfooting.</i>
He raised
himself up onto his mighty haunches against the scathing velocities and
crashed his back paws straight through the cabinet floor, splintering
metal and screws. His paws cracked through the burning wood tracks like
an anchor. In an instant the entire carriage whipcracked onto its end.
Fangles stood still, rooted to the tracks and the metal floor tore
around him as it upended, leaving a ragged body-shaped hole.</P>
<P>He swayed for a while as the zinging and crunching sounds receded
from his hearing, then he opened his eyes and picked the bits of metal
from his hide.</P>
<P>‘FAAANNNGG-‘</P>
<P>Fangles instinctively threw a paw towards the blur of sound and
scooped Heep from her speeding carriage. She dangled there, held by one
tin leg. Sparks in the air. The atmosphere like hot coals against their
cheeks. A droning fury of wind. </P>
<P>‘Down boy’ she said, smiling.</P>
<P>He slung her over his hunchbacked shoulders and jumped off the
disintegrating track into the crimson mists below.</P>

<P class=drop>‘One might approach this with an over-zealous sense of
reassembly,’
yawned Rapley as the golden Carousel horse bobbed through the scarlet
fog.</P>
<P>Above him sparks glinted in the sky like distant constellations.
There was a muffled clatter amongst the cloud tops.</P>
<P>‘But, from what I can see, it isn’t a question of frantic surgical
repair. Rather, I feel we should concentrate on getting to the heart of
things. If a psyche can be said to have a heart, that is.’</P>
<P>He drifted off vaguely, fishing a mint from his pocket.</P>
<P>Mr Violet, his feet jammed into stiff, wooden stirrups, was almost
throttling his teak steed in an effort not to fall off. The horse had
emeralds for eyes and a furred cobra for a tail, which hissed and spat
behind him.</P>
<P>The two carousel nags had swooped down casually from the air as
soon as
they had crossed over, hovering silently next to them like a taxi rank.
So they had obliged. The horses seemed to know where they were
going.</P>
<P>Mr Violet looked up into the smoiling
clouds, aware of an indistinct droning. ‘I
feared the pressures of a hand squeezing within my soul as soon
as we materialised here, attempting to shred and then consume who I am.
Threatening my personality with its digestive enzymes. It’s a good
thing I can’t be bothered to actually have a personality these days.
Rather moves the goalposts for the poor man, don’t you think?’</P>
<P>Bertha nodded and mouthed something noncommittal. With her hands
around
Rapley’s waist, she was staring open-mouthed at
the scenery. She felt herself blurring into this exquisitely brutal
territory, the edges of herself bleeding into the man’s searing mental
landscape.</P>
<P>In the far distance on either side, she could see sharp ridges of
mountainous terrain. But ridges turned on their side so that they were
facing inwards towards them. Black peaks turned an ominous grey by the
fog which drifted around them in a nebulous dance; a veil of
sweet-smelling coppery gauze. </P>
<P>The fog sweated the three travellers like a volcanic sauna. Bertha
felt an insistent and distracting but not entirely unpleasant ache in
her stomach. Violet had vomited twice into his pith helmet. Rapley had
sighed and munched a cheese and tomato sandwich. ‘If you feel yourself 
dissipating or forgetting who you are, let me
know and I’ll remind you. I know disgusting secrets about the both of
you, after all, and one of them is sure to shock you back into
something approaching sentient self-awareness. Need I mention Chelsea
pensioners?’ </P>
<P>Here, Mr Violet paused from his regurgitation to wince and redden.
</P>
<P>‘Or sodomy, rum and the lash?’</P>
<P>A grin flicked across Bertha’s face.</P>
<P>‘I shall deploy them if necessary, so hang on to your egos.’</P>
<P>The drone
 from above turned into a cometary roar. A bow
wave of
pressure cleared a ten foot wide gap in the mists ahead of them and a
smear of bodies crashed into the ground.</P>
<P>Not letting the dust settle, Heep popped out of the impact crater,
snapping her arm back into place, antlers shivering with the shock of
the landing. ‘Ooooh jesus yes… Rapley! Ah. Fascinating country this, but needs
demolition. Or r&eacute;gime change, certainly.’</P>
<P>Rapley beamed and slid off the equine, throwing a crust over his
shoulder. ‘Heep! My regimental beauty! Perfectly simple job, this. Knew you’d
screw it up.’</P>
<P>Bertha hmphed and waited for an introduction.</P>
<P>A snuffling from the crater. Mr Violet scuttled to the lip, helmet
in hand like an alms bowl.</P>
<P>‘Oh, Pompey? Little Pompey? Refreshing soup. A broth for you after
your exertions.’, he cooed.</P>
<P>A wrinkled and mud-caked trunk quivered its way out of the hole and
slopped heavily into the proffered pith helmet, slurping up the chunky
expulsion.</P>
<P>‘FLLAAUURRGGHHHH!’</P>
<P>The pink soup fountained up into the air in a thick spray, followed
by the leaping form of Fangles, bowling Mr Violet over like a skittle.
The thrashing figures rolled and punched and kicked before coming to a
panting, guffawing halt. </P>
<P>‘Violet!’ Fangles grinned through his demented fangs. ‘You’re
dressed like Roger Moore!’</P>
<P>Mr Violet ruffled his friend’s fur and scratched behind one of his
huge bent ears with both hands.</P>
<P>‘Still ugly as sin, you wretched old hound!’ His moustache shook
with joy.</P>
<P>They convened as a group to the relative comfort of a raised stone
plateau. From this lofty position Rapley and Heep glared out over the
landscape. Mr Violet, Bertha and the excitable Fangles, thick tail wagging
dangerously like a flailing club, shared out tea and sandwiches and
loaded blue bullets into the stealthy, matt black revolver.</P>
<P>‘Calcinates’, explained Heep unhelpfully, ‘And sodium, acids of
course, variegated coagulants, vitamin mountains, beds of cancer cells,
corals of them, in fact.’</P>
<P>Rapley flicked an index finger down his lips, popping sounds
punctuating the list.</P>
<P>‘Bloods. A landscape of assorted interior quantities seamed with
blood. It’s immeasurable, Rapley. How do we find a part of him nucleic
enough to do damage to?’</P>
<P>Rapley clicked his heels together and whistled into the air.</P>
<P>‘Every time we consider ourselves to have reached a solid target, we
are either marauded by a cacophony of anguished, malignant cell
growths, or begin to lose all sense of our own selves. We need
direction! A map! An unravelled ball of twine... something!’</P>
<P>Rapley drew triangles in the dust with his boot tips.</P>
<P>Heep tinked her spurs against the rocky ground. ‘Rapley!’</P>
<P>But he just peered at the triangle and mused: ‘Scalene..?’</P>
<P>‘Twerp! Listen to me!’ She stamped her sheet metal slippers, the claws within scratching
the tin with the briefest of hidden sparks.</P>
<P>Rapley strode to the edge of the low plateau, hands clasped tight
behind his back. He pouted and paused. Shook his head at some debate
inside his own bulbous brain. ‘Really, Heep’, he said at last, ‘The Interior? It’s beneath you. I
mean, why…?’</P>
<P>‘Ah,’ said Heep.</P>
<P>He looked around his nose at her.</P>
<P>‘Rapley, they offered me a laboratory. All the Bunsen burners and
tubular vascillators and basking circuitry and reiki baffles and zinc
malchemides I could ever, ever need.’</P>
<P>Rapley frowned at his fingernails. ‘Still…,’ he said, his voice clipped and hurt.</P>
<P>Heep rested the sharp fingers of one hand softly against his
cheek. ‘You remember when I took Fangles on. You told the two of us to go
and see the worlds. All of them. And to look after each other. You
glazed that slogan onto a teapot for us: ‘Dreams die, that’s what
they’re there for, just dream, don’t wake up, be careful.’ So we have
been. And we’ve tempered the excesses of The Interior wherever
possible. Me and the beast help people. From within, admittedly, but we
help. Fangles gets mermaids, did he tell you that? They love him. They
call him the Elvis Whale.’</P>
<P>Rapley smiled gently but his eyes disagreed. ‘The Interior are contemptuous,’ 
he announced, ‘and as dismissive and
disdainful as flamingoes. They insult the intelligence. And to be
insulted by such fascists is so degrading.’</P>
<P>‘I agree. But we’re clipping its feathers bit by bit with our
patience, our damnable good moral taste and our very specific and
well-directed acts of disobedience and violence.’</P>
<P>‘A slow job. And questionable, I think. Questionable.’</P>
<P>‘The job. We must finish it, old pal.’</P>
<P>‘Yes, yes. I know.’</P>
<P>‘Then we’ll parlay. Debate and decide.’</P>
<P>‘Well, yes.’</P>
<P>‘We need to find him. Get to the brain. Turn all this off.’</P>
<P>‘Of course.’</P>
<P>‘Lord knows how, though.’</P>
<P>‘Horses.’</P>
<P>’Horses?’</P>
<P>‘Oh, didn’t I tell you? They said they’d take us to him. He likes
the attention, you see.’</P>
<P>Heep’s entire body sighed. ‘Well then why are we..? Oh, why bother..’ 
She turned and stomped back to the others, flicking a brace of
fingers at the smugly grinning Mr Rapley.</P>
<P>So they mounted the wooden horses, with their gaudy painted frills
and their viscous eyes like soft egg yolks bulging to the point of
collapse through their mahogany sockets.</P>
<P>Rapley and Heep, delicately side-saddled, sat on one. Bertha and the
bilious Violet atop the other. Fangles, complaining of aching knees and
churning guts, pounded along the ground beneath them under his own
considerable steam, his hide reddening with every step from the crimson
dust.</P>
<P>Rapley craned his head round to the front of his nag, ear to its
carved, pursed mouth, as it gently whispered to him. A sound blown with
the merest of pressures and efforts, like a child murmuring on the edge
of sleep. ‘I see.’, he said. And, ‘Well, that’s really awfully good of
you,’</P>
<P>He patted the crest of its elaborately carved mane and turned to the
others. ‘We go higher, apparently.’ he elucidated.</P>
<P>Fangles snuffled gruffly and said that was easy for you to say.</P>
<P>The horses gracefully swooped upwards, four pairs of hands grabbing
and scrabbling for purchase as a practically vertical route was chosen
into the sparking, howling sky. The rushing g-forces flapped their cheeks and billowed their
clothing like the epileptic spirits of washing lines. Bertha’s head and
neck had been pushed owlishly round almost one hundred and eighty
degrees and as she struggled again to face the underbellies of the
dense nimbic formations, she caught sight of Fangles below, padding
slowly and disconsolately to a stop, panting and staring up at them
with liquid eyes. His forehead wrinkled and his jowls drooped, he
stomped a back foot, knowing it would achieve nothing. </P>
<P>Then there was a sudden change in pressure, an expulsion of fluted
air honed to a shriek of intent issuing from the wooden animal Rapley
and Bertha were clinging to.</P>
<P>The moment hung in the air along with the two horses as they drew
horizontal and level enough for the four passengers to exchange looks
of considerable panic and not a little regret.</P>
<P>And with that, the carousel horses spun heads down to face the
earth.</P>
<P>And they plummeted.</P>
<P>The ground beneath them appeared to be coring itself. Fangles leapt
back and turned the air blue as the earth cracked and twisted itself in
a flurry of deconstruction. </P>
<P>The four airborne adventurers widened their eyes and said their fair
share of extravagant curses as the determined nags shrieked their yells
of approach and met ground level. </P>
<P>When they opened their eyes, presuming that they would be greeted by
magnificent vistas of Elysium and the afterlife, Rapley, Bertha, Heep
and Mr Violet were vaguely disappointed and yet thrillingly relieved to
find themselves in a deep, dark, vertical shaft, the sky a distant
circle far above them. They were falling, or, more accurately, bouncing
from side to side down the narrow fall space, and all scrabbled
successfully for hand and footholds amongst the wooden scaffolding
poles which lined the shaft.</P>
<P>As they steadied themselves, they became aware of the two wooden
horses slowly circling below like sleek painted sharks, their snouts
raised towards them watchfully.</P>
<P>Rapley brushed splinters from his fringe and spoke. ‘Thank you both, 
a most exhilarating experience. I presume the only
way is down?’</P>
<P>The horses gracefully dipped and raised their handsome heads.
Rapley’s nag, a resplendent beast of paisley dapples and sea green mane
breathed sounds that remained below the reach of most human ears.</P>
<P>Rapley glared back at them, chin set firm and resolute. The others
hung on tight to their respective nooks and crannies and leant forward
to try and catch the enigmatic conversation.</P>
<P>When Rapley spoke, his voice was thick. ‘But why? Why would he..’</P>
<P>The second circling horse rubbed itself roughly against the side of
the shaft, seeming to exult in the touch of the rough earth. It exhaled
language softly and looked up at him with tired eyes.</P>
<P>Rapley stiffened. ‘I see.’ He said at length, and then turned to his companions. 
‘Don’t look. Please. They wish to be remembered as they were.’
He turned his eyes to the wall. </P>
<P>The others hesitantly followed his lead. Bertha yanked down her
hood. Heep lowered a visor over her eyes and averted her gaze. Violet
pushed his pith helmet down over his face like a fencing mask. None of
them quite knew why.</P>
<div class=pullquote>A set of keys upon a brass ring, each one gently
pulsing, squirmed like maggots</div>
<P>The air beneath them buzzed and crackled. A chafing, sawing grind
filled their ears. But it was only when the low moaning began that
Bertha tugged the hood back from over one eye and stared straight
down. The carousel horses were being sanded away in midair. Invisible
implements turning their bodies into frantic showers of woodchip and
dust til all that was left was a horses sea green head grinning with
wide, bulging, crying eyes. Then even that was gone.  Bertha watched 
them disappear with the still, expressionless,
attentive look of a child seeing its first ever act of human
violence.</P>
<P>‘Why did he do that?’ she breathed, almost without moving her
lips.</P>
<P>‘They told me what he was going to do to them, and I asked them that
same question,’, sighed Pasha. ‘They replied &quot;there’s no whys with
him. It just happens&quot;’</P>
<P>Rapley manoeuvred himself into a sitting position on a jutting rail
of scaffold and sparked a gasper. He looked below and a fiendish grin cut his face.
‘Journey to the centre of the Earth, anyone?’</P>
<P>They could hear Fangles mooing and roaring far above them at the lip
of the shaft, but Heep yelled at him to stay where he was, to guard the
entrance and guide them back to the surface when necessary. He wasn’t happy 
about this exclusion but nevertheless accepted that
his bovine lack of physical delicacy would have made his journey down
the narrow hole counterproductive at the very least.</P>
<P>They lit matches and stared into the nooks and shelves formed by the
crisscrossing, roughly hewn scaffold bars, all the while ponderously
clambering further down the dank and musty shaft.</P>
<P>On their descent, they caught sight of a variety of shadowy and
obscene objects.
<UL><LI>A cat’s head in a pickle jar, gazing blankly out at them, reciting
nursery rhymes as they passed. 
<LI>A rank of rusty tin soldiers with their dress trousers around their
ankles enacted a circular chain of buggery with military
synchronisation.
<LI>A map or diagram of a head, the brain inside the skull stretching
inexorably back from the frontal lobe, squashed against the back of the
expanded skull into a coiling, looping tail. The very tip of it poked
through the skin. 
<LI>A set of keys upon a brass ring, each one gently pulsing, squirmed
like maggots.
<LI>An ancient set of tea mugs depicting a royal wedding, filled to the
brim with toenail cuttings and a gentleman’s wristwatch, hands ticking
backwards past all twenty three points of the clock face.
<LI>A wax effigy of a baby with a young girl’s head, fingers melting
towards the surface of the scaffold til they resembled marionette
strings leading nowhere.
<LI>A binoculars-style kaleidoscope which, when held to the eyes,
revealed a prismic view of the many and varied ends of the world, all
shattered into tiny fragmentary scenes. A tiny speaker hissed a
soundtrack of applause and pounded meat.</UL></P>
<P>Something occurred to Rapley and he stopped climbing and cocked his
head to one side. He puffed up his cheeks and his feet performed a tap
dance on a wooden strut. With a chortle he leapt back up the shaft, climbing over Heep and Mr
Violet in his haste. Bertha swung to one side to avoid the whirl of
elbows, knees and manic giggles scampering past her.</P>
<P>Rapley thrust his face into an alcove and came away with the cranial
diagram. ‘A tube map!’ he announced, one eye clamped shut as he concentrated
on the grimy piece of foolscap paper in front of him. ‘Next floor down,
twenty paces as the stone falls, third beam inwards, chop it three
times with a thin bladed knife and we reveal the legend behind the
facade’ </P>
<P>The others eyed him cautiously.</P>
<P>‘At least, I think that’s what it says’, he shrugged, ‘I’m having to
read between the lines somewhat.’</P>
<P>With one hand holding the map close against his nose Rapley dropped
down the shaft. The others scuttled after him like spiders. Twenty paces 
down they dropped one by one onto a jutting beam and
knelt quietly as Rapley pulled a Swiss army knife from the band of Mr
Violet’s pith helmet. The strange, thin man hacked three times at a
wooden bar anchored deep into the dank, mossy wall. As three wood 
shavings sycamored through the air, the beam above the
whittled bar gave an abrupt lurch and creaked up and down like a
chopstick, its twin below joining it in this bizarre pantomime.</P>
<P>The four adventurers held on for dear life as the scaffold bars
jacknifed ferociously, digging a wet and widening hole through the
glistening moss wall.</P>
<P>‘Quickly!’ Yelled Rapley over the cacophony of clattering timber and
shifting earth, ‘Through the very eye of the storm!’He dashed through 
the hole, narrowly avoiding the manic swishings of
the scaffold tips. Bertha, Heep and the intrepid Violet followed suit, Violet holding
his helmet over Bertha’s head like an umbrella against an April
shower.</P>
<P>The hollow clashes of heavy wood receded as they tumbled to a stop
on the other side, and when they righted themselves and turned to look,
they found a sealed wall behind them. A hexagonal brass-framed mirror
hung aslant, returning their gaze, it’s surface heavy with dust and
smeared with a pattern of miniscule blood red lipstick kisses.</P>
<P>Heep rattled to her cloven feet and thrust a sharp finger into the
nearest wall. It was sweaty and coloured a thickly opaque white that
crimsoned to the touch like a blush. There was a sense of far off
movement on the other side of the walls, like shadows through a winter
mist or submerged animals rising from the depths of the ocean with a
glacial lack of haste.</P>
<P>Bertha toppled upright onto the soles of her moonboots and cast
glances to and fro. The corridor in which they found themselves stretched in front of
them in a snaking curve, glowing embers in cast iron upturned mouths
dimly lighting the way along the walls.</P>
<P>They became aware of a gnashing of tiny teeth and a rustling rush of
footsteps from around the bend, distorted shadows zoomed towards them
across the corridor floor, rippled and swayed from side to side by the
flickering flames.</P>
<P>Rapley stepped forward and pulled a post-it note from his pocket,
glancing down to decipher Dosun’s wildly looping handwriting. 
‘Mr Andrews? We’re from the office. You’ve gone anticlockwise, old
fruit, mind if we lend a hand?’</P>
<P>The chattering and scuffling grew louder and closer. The manic
shadows danced across ceiling, floor and walls. Jagged, poking shadows.
Shadows made by sharp edges. </P>
<P>Behind his back, Mr Violet withdrew his revolver from the bag and
licked the fringe of his moustache. ‘Just say the word, Mr Rapley.’ he muttered,
sotto voce. </P>
<P>And with that, the shadows burst into life. Stubby outstretched arms 
and legs and stunted ovoid bodies coalesced
from the depths, dwarfish creatures grinning with mad intent. They
scuttled and jabbered and whipped across ceiling and floor like a
pestilential swarm of fear.</P>
<P>‘They... they all look the same!’ Said Violet, and indeed it was true.
 The creatures all resembled each other to a shocking extent: oafish
faces empty of meaning, small features crowded into the middle of
swollen balloon heads, upturned piggy noses and wet, thick dark red
lips like a bicycle inner tube, a crown of ginger hair and shiny
circles of fatigue under the eyes. </P>
<P>The creatures pounced on the four repulsed explorers, swarming over
them in a ravaging mass, scratching and biting and throwing kicks like
tiny hammer blows.</P>
<P>Bertha, nearer to them in size than her companions, slugged it out
with a crowd of them, her deft and accurate uppercuts felling them one
by one.</P>
<P>Violet used his pith helmet as a shield as he despatched blue
bullets into the middles of their expansive foreheads.</P>
<P>Heep took the tops off their heads as if they were boiled eggs.</P>
<P>Rapley gave them a kicking.</P>
<P>‘There are too many of these perverted malcontents!’ yelled Rapley,
‘Run!’ He made a dash down the corridor, ploughing a furrow through the
giggling, gnashing dwarves as he went. The others followed suit,
crushing tiny bodies underfoot as they sped after him.</P>
<P>‘I have an inkling,’, mused Rapley as he ran, ‘that our cursed
quarry may be dead ahead of us, lurking in his lair around the bend.
Behold the walls!’</P>
<P>The other three turned their heads as they ran. The walls were
widening as the corridor progressed, and what’s more the colour had
blushed to a sickening crimson. The air throbbed with pressure, a
hollow, bass moan shuddered the ground beneath their feet. Their ears
popped and their jaws began to ache. Rapley slowed to a walk as the corridor opened into a large
room.</P>
<P>A vast animal of a man lay slumped in one corner. The same ginger
crown and miniscule features in an over-inflated head, but this was
flesh on an altogether larger scale than the stunted knee-high freaks
they had previously encountered. His bloated body was clad in an ill-fitting black suit. A white
shirt, black tie and black boots completed the ensemble. His face was
tear-streaked and his mouth convulsed in sobs of pain. He clutched a
framed photo of an unremarkably pretty young woman in a frilled white
shirt, smiling guilelessly at the camera.</P>
<P>Mr Andrews turned his gaze to his guests as he wiped a slick of
tears away with a veritable beef joint of a hand.</P>
<P>Rapley peered at the man with undisguised pity and gave a curt
bow. ‘Mr Andrews?’</P>
<P>The obese gentleman nodded through his sobs.</P>
<P>‘We have been seconded by the company to stitch you back together.
It seems you have become somewhat unravelled.’</P>
<P>Mr Andrews held in front of him the picture of the girl in the white
shirt, he gripped it in two hands like a steering wheel. His voice, when 
it came, was that of a slow and demented child. Like
someone chewing an onion. ‘She has left the furniture in here. The mugs and carpets, the
fittings remain but don’t work. There is no love.’</P>
<P>As he spoke, he stomped his feet in a tribal drumbeat. He slapped
the side of his head with the steak of his palm. ‘My heart is gashed. 
And I am split in thousands. I shall damage
some more things now.’</P>
<P>‘I have bullets left,’ hissed Violet out of the corner of his
mouth.</P>
<P>‘We can’t shoot him,’ cautioned Heep, ‘Lord knows what’ll happen if
we destroy his mental capacities completely. We may not survive the
seismic shock.’</P>
<P>Rapley took a step closer towards the vast lovelorn brute. ‘Will 
you come quietly?’ he enquired.</P>
<P>Mr Andrews roared an almighty roar in reply. The force of it
billowed Rapley’s mackintosh hems into a rippling trail. Bertha was
blown like a tumbleweed against the far wall.</P>
<P>Rapley wiped spit off his face and coughed lightly. ‘Then it is war, sir.’</P>
<P>There was a crack and a fizz and a blink, and Rapley’s face seemed
to puff up in much the same manner 
as his clothing and then it expanded
to the size of an Easter Island Statue. His mouth flew open and emitted
an elephantine bellow
that sent Andrews spinning.</P>
<P>Then the two men flew against each other, Rapley dancing legs
akimbo, arms whirling every which way, body arcing in physically
impossible ways. Andrews swatted and gnashed at him, growling like a
wounded universe. Electrical sparks buzzed and zapped around them as the others dived
clear. Soon Rapley and Andrews were spinning in a whirl of dust and motion,
blurred features and limbs barely distinguishable through the
vortex.</P>
<P>‘Best stay out of this then..?’ muttered Bertha.</P>
<P>‘On balance, yes,’ nodded Violet.</P>
<P>Rapley’s head popped out of the maelstrom as it zipped round at
dangerous speeds.</P>
<P>‘Need… Diversion…. Get… Beast..’</P>
<P>Heep ran to the corridor and shouted a single word.</P>
<P>‘FAAANNGGLLLLLEES!’</P>
<P>‘As far as I can tell,’ she explained to Bertha as she ran back into
the room, ’this is an entirely psychic battle. It only has the
<i>appearance</i> of a physical ruck.’</P>
<P>The ground shook with the promise of a fresh presence. A mighty
panting issued from far down the corridor. They heard distant sounds of
heavy breakages and of small things squelched underfoot.</P>
<P>‘GGGRRRRRRRAAAGGGHHHHHHHH!’</P>
<P>The many-hooved shaggy form of Pompadour Aloysius Fangles III shot
into the room, bristly fur scraping the sides and ceiling of the room
as he leapt through the air, trunk trumpeting the angriest of
introductions.</P>
<P>He disappeared into the spinning blur of bodies, slamming against
the heavier man with a sickening, bone-crunching thud.</P>
<P>They dropped to the floor as one, the air filled with a sonic boom
of immeasurable decibels.</P>
<P>A slow quiet drift of dust and blinking eyes. The ambience breathed
a slow and deep sigh of relief.</P>
<P>Rapley popped his head up from the other side of the two twitching,
inert mammoths. ‘A most excellent anaesthetic!’ he grinned.</P>
<P class=drop>Heep gently led Fangles by his dented trunk as he tottered
in a wide
circle around the walls of the room. A slow revivification of his
senses was taking place and it was unanimously agreed that Heep was the
only person present who could talk him out of one of his violent moods
if his sensory arousal turned sour. He had been known to eat whole
alarm clocks.</P>
<P>The sonorously snoring body of Mr Andrews lay stretched out on a
table. Rapley was knocking on various parts of his anatomy with an HB
pencil and whispering invocations in a mellifluous French tongue. 
‘There,’ he said, tucking the pencil behind his own ear, ‘I’ve
locked him up as tight as you like.’</P>
<P>He turned to Bertha and Mr Violet.
‘What you witnessed was mere theatre, an externalisation of a rather
absorbing conversation we were having on a more abstracted and rarified
mental plane. Mr Andrews here was good enough to explain to me his
current quandary of the heart. It seems his breakdown came about due to
a soured love affair.’ He picked up the photograph of the girl. 
‘Andrews was a titanic man, capable of moving the world with a twist
of his thoughts. But he was not, I’m afraid, a strong or emotionally
secure man. One in his position in the Interior must essentially have
no heart or soul to speak of, must indeed be merely a tool or conduit
for his own spectacular abilities, a receptacle with no room left for
the vagaries of human doubt or those true clutches of the emotions that
send all rationality spinning out of control like a sycamore leaf in a
blast furnace. In a sociopathically standard operation such as the
Interior one must have a dead soul. Andrews was not equipped with such,
and, consequently, when love struck, he was euphoric. And when love
died and turned to ashes in the harsh daylight of his own emotional
immaturity, he was not equipped to just shrug it off.’</P>
<P>‘He went bonkers,’ nodded Bertha.</P>
<P>‘Quite. The young woman is Hildegard Boone. A woman of great
kindness and tolerance, but not so much that she could continue to cope
with the unfettered, bludgeoning and unrefined declarations of love
proffered by Andrews after her first blush of infatuation with the man
had run its course. When last he heard of her, she had fled to
Hastings with tears shining her cheeks in order to run a boarding
house. I suppose we may be thankful he didn’t pursue her. Lord knows
Hastings is broken-hearted enough without being slathered in the
externalised chaos of Mr Andrews’ churning romantic frustrations.’</P>
<P>‘He seems to have opened up to you considerably,’ said Violet
optimistically, ‘Perhaps reason and sanity are returning and will
prevail.?’</P>
<P> ‘Ah. No. I gleaned most of the story between his cries, sobs and
repeated attempts to remove the sanity from my person in the manner of
a mental cutpurse. He’s quite mad. We mustn’t let him loose.’</P>
<P>A snuffle from the outskirts of the room, Fangles had awoken and was
engaged in heated conversation with Heep.</P>
<P>‘Pasha! Fangles and I have been talking about that.’ 
Heep led the stumbling beast to the table.‘We have elected to stay inside 
him, at least for the foreseeable
future. We think it would be interesting to take him for a drive.’</P>
<P>Rapley scratched his ears.</P>
<P>‘You see, if you can guarantee that whatever locks you’ve installed
on his will won’t break, then we think a change of ownership would be
morally acceptable. And scientifically I must admit that it gives me
the horn to think about testing these broadcast capabilities of
his.’</P>
<P>Fangles sniggered and a string of drool drooped from his jaws. 
‘It’ll be Pilsner and mermaids as far as the eye can see.’</P>
<P>‘Well,’ said Rapley after a pause, ‘I suppose you couldn’t bugger
things up any more than <i>he</i> did.’</P>
<P>Mr Violet bade farewell to his old furry friend, letting him lick his
face with his pitted, scouring tongue. Violet jammed the pith helmet on
top of Fangles’ vast head as an afterthought. It looked like a thimble
on him.</P>
<P>Heep waved at Bertha, Rapley and Violet absently, already
half-absorbed in the logistics of harnessing the peculiar talents of
the man Andrews.</P>
<P>With Fangles trotting round Heep in a protective circle, the three
weary adventurers walked away into the thinning mists. </P>
<P class=drop>The screen in the Ramp cinema buzzed into a dance of
static, and
they emerged through the deranged light with distortion dripping off
their shoulders like the strands of a bead curtain.</P>
<P>Catherine Paranda threw her magnesium sticks aside and looked behind
them at the screen. ‘Where are the rest?’ she hissed.</P>
<P>‘Ah,’ lamented Rapley, ‘Alas, they did not make it. 
They were burnt out, rendered powerless 
by the ferocity of his thoughts.’ He looked at the floor with theatrical woe.</P>
<P>Bertha sniffed back non-existent tears. Violet, no good at this sort
of thing, whistled softly and looked at his toes.</P>
<P>Dosun sprang up from his chair with an agility surprising in one so
tubby. ‘Pah! Details! It cannot be helped. A shame, verily, but the man is
awake! He is restored!’ He waddled over to Rapley and shook his hand
vigorously. ‘Congratulations to you and your associates! A job well done.’</P>
<P>‘Yes. All shipshape,’ said Rapley circumspectly, ‘though it's
entirely possible that you may notice one or two slight differences in
Andrews' temperament and aspect.’</P>
<P>Paranda ushered them through to the next room. ‘Well, of course, he 
may need time to readjust,’ she said, ‘But look -
he is awake!’</P>
<P>Mr Andrews was sitting on the edge of a metal gurney, swinging his
hefty shanks to and fro and muttering unintelligible syllables under
the gusts of his breath. His eyes were clouded and his brow flexed up
and down like a Venetian blind.</P>
<P>‘Oh,’ said Rapley. ‘He’s here. What a pleasant surprise.’</P>
<P>Mr Violet winced and backed slowly out of the room, Bertha following
suit.</P>
<P>Rapley whipped around. ‘Charming exercise, a lovely time was had by all. We simply have to
do it again. But now we really must be going.’</P>
<P>As they sped out of the room with impolite haste, there came a
rumbling from the gurney as the Andrews creature spoke out loud. ‘I think. 
I think I would like. Like a breath of... fresh air,
please’</P>
<P>Paranda and Dosun rushed to his side wearing expressions of beatific
joy. ‘Certainly,’ said one. ‘Allow us,’ said the other, and they assisted
the giant in whatever small ways they could as he took faltering
gorilla strides towards the front door.</P>
<P>The late afternoon air was clear and crisp, the rainclouds had
drifted on their way to their next appointments. </P>
<P>‘Well, cheerio, then,’ waved Rapley as he, Mr Violet and Bertha edged
away from the other trio of unusual personages. </P>
<P>‘Is it working? Do Heep and Fangles have the reins?’ said Violet, out
of the corner of his mouth.</P>
<P>‘Difficult to say for sure,’ muttered Rapley, ‘but he hasn’t killed
anyone yet, so the signs are encouraging.’</P>
<P>Paranda and Dosun fawned over the blinking Mr Andrews as, in slow
motion, he lifted one immense paw in front of his face, the fingers
outstretched. A look of intense concentration creased his face.</P>
<P>There was the fleshy pop of a small birthsqueeze and tiny petals
sprang up around each fingertip. Andrews stared in concentration as
these petals grew features, each one a tiny smiling, giggling
replication of Mr Andrews’ own face, striped and coloured in vibrant
cockatoo hues of red and green. Paranda and Dosun leapt back in alarm, gasping in shock at such
frivolity.</P>
<P>The laughing petal faces began to chant nursery rhymes and then, one
by one, they popped free of their finger stalks and floated up into
the air like cherry blossom. Each petal was instantly replaced by
another before that, too, popped and separated, filling the air around
them all with a drifting carpet of hundreds of brightly coloured,
laughing facial spores. </P>
<P>Petals began to emerge around Andrews’ eyes like a pair of novelty
spectacles, each detaching itself when fully formed to join the
chattering merriment in the sky.</P>
<P>‘You don’t see that every day,’ observed Rapley as they ran away
from the scene, tiny winking petals blowing them kisses as they whirled
in their wake.</P>
<P>‘Can we go home now?’ shouted Bertha.</P>
<P>‘Certainly. I feel rather jaded from all this activity. The
excitement has begun to wear off and once again I can feel the cape of
boredom draping itself over my slender shoulders. A cup of tea and a
Garibaldi sounds ideal.’</P>
<P>A flock of pigeons swooped through the giggling, multi-coloured
cloud of leaves in the sky, emerging wearing headdresses of shining red
and green petals. They looked at each other in confusion, like petulant
sultans.</P>
<P>The moon had begun to show itself through the rich, dark blueness.
</P>
<P>Down below, all was well.</P>

[*ITEM] Ghosts and Aliens

[*AUTHOR] John A. Frochio

[*BLURB] Very short, very chilling.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The aliens lived among us.  We got along
with them well enough.  Except for the ghosts who roamed the cities and
towns.  They shunned the aliens.

Their spaceship stood among the broken slides and monkey bars of an
abandoned children's playground outside our town.  It looked like a tall
monument to Pablo Picasso, all lines and sharp angles and almost
recognizable shapes.  The alien overlords lived there.  They never came
out.

I worked with two of the embedded aliens.  Today I invited one of
them, Chrixval, a female, to join me for a "working lunch."  We ate on a
picnic bench outside the old mill where we worked in the analytical lab.
I was the lab supervisor and she was a senior technician.

"None of us," she said, indicating others of her race who were
walking past us, "were involved in the invasion, Alistair.  It was the
overlords."  She nodded toward their spaceship.

I didn't look where she was indicating.  I didn't need to look.
Instead I looked down and then back up at her.

"Don't worry about it," I said.  "At least they're letting us live
our lives."

I wanted to get to know Chrixval better.  I was a single father in my
early forties, still decent looking and in good shape.  She was
comparable to an Earth woman in her twenties, darkly exotic, sensual.
Her eyes were a deeply piercing violet color.

I looked into those eyes.  They were hypnotic.  I didn't know much
about the aliens' personal lives, but I was willing to learn.
She said, "How did your wife die?"

I sighed.  I knew I couldn't keep the truth from her.
"She died during the invasion.  She was a soldier."


"Ah."  She hesitated.  "She's one of the ghosts that walk this town."

I nodded.


"You know the overlords constructed the ghosts?  They made them from
the deconstructed energies captured from your people's dead brain
cells."


"I know."

She leaned close to me.  "But did you know they made the ghosts to be
their spies?  They didn't trust us, their own people."

I watched my wife's ghostly figure stare at me from the entrance to
our building.  I felt a chill.

I didn't know, but I suspected it all along.

[*BLURB] The Only Way Out?
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The colony was on a small island in a
large, slowly flowing river. The colony was on the island because that
is where the matter-transmitter was, and the matter-transmitter was on
the island because the starship that had bought it from Earth had put it
there. This wasn't an accident: the ship’s limited A.I. had been told to
look for such a place. Islands, the thinking behind its programming
went, were defensible, had a ready supply of water, and were, possibly,
on an easily navigable, and easily explorable route from any coast to
deep into the interior.

Alvi, Emma, and Jenny were not on the island. Alvi, Emma, and Jenny were on
a boat some ten, slow and cautious week's travel downriver. For the past
five weeks they had been in unexplored territory. The colony had been on
the planet for eighteen years and they were further away from it than
any of the colonists had yet ventured into the planet's vast, seemingly
endless, untouched jungle.

<p class=drop><i>Emma was just tidying up the reception desk, preparing to
go off shift, to go home, when the system crashed. All the screens
before her froze for a second and then blanked. She stared at them for a
moment unable to comprehend. One system going down she could understand
- but all of them? She keyed in her login and tried to reboot. Nothing
happened. She switched to the other console and tried again. Dead.</i>

<i>Behind her the doors leading through to the Emigration rooms swooshed
open and Celia, her relief, came through. “What’s happened?” asked
Celia. “The desk in room seven twenty-three is down.”</i>

<i>“I know,” said
Emma. “I think they’re all down. The whole system looks like it has
crashed.”</i>

<i>“Don’t be silly.” Celia nudged Emma aside and typed at the
unresponsive keyboard and then, just as Emma had done, tried again at
the other. Celia looked at the screens in disbelief and then looked at
Emma. “It can’t be the whole system. The whole system can’t just die
like this….”</i>

<p class=drop>Emma came to the stern of the wide, raft-like boat and handed Alvi a sandwich. 
“Enjoy it,” she said. “That’s the last of the meat. It’s fish from now on unless 
you want to go ashore and do some hunting.” She took the tiller from him as he ate.

“Thanks,” he said as he finished. He wiped crumbs off his hands. “I needed that. Did you take the salinity 
readings?” 

“Yes,” she said. “Still the same.”

“I don’t know why we bother," he said. “A river this size is bound to push 
fresh water out into any ocean far faster than sea water can contaminate it. 
Not that I think there is any sea. I think this damn river just goes on forever. 
One of these days we’re going to come round a bend and see the colony again.”

Emma laughed. “That’s impossible.”

“No, I’m serious. This river is like one of Esher’s staircases. It goes round 
and round and never gets anywhere. Any one bit looks perfectly rational and 
real, but follow it around long enough and you impossibly get back where you 
started.” He made a wide gesture. “The River Escher!”

Jenny came up from the cramped cabin below deck.
“Who’s Escher?” she asked.

“An artist,” said Emma. “He drew impossible buildings and optical tricks. 
Fascinating stuff.”

“Oh," said Jenny, losing interest. "From Earth?”

“Yes. Twentieth century. I’ve got some of his pictures in books back home. 
I’ll show you them when we get back if you want.”

Jenny made a non-committal grunt of thanks. She was sixteen years old and had 
never seen Earth, and she never would; it was impossible, the matter-transmitter 
on the island only worked one way. That was how the colonies were populated. 
Long range drone ships took years to reach possible new Earths, their only cargo 
a quantum entangled matter-transmitter. Once a new habitable planet had been 
found, the matter-transmitter was deployed and its twin back on earth un-crated. 
At first, simple machines were sent through. The simple machines built a larger 
matter-transmitter, then the complex machines were sent through - then the colonists. 
It was a one way trip. Each colonist arrived on alien soil and at the same time never 
left Earth. The matter-transmitters duplicated them sending atom perfect copies 
instantaneously across the light years while the originals went back to their normal 
lives. Emma had worked in an Emigration Centre sending volunteers to the colonies 
until one day, finally overcome by curiosity, she had Emigrated herself. And then 
three months later she had done it again. On the fifth attempt she found herself 
here. It was irrational. She knew that the previous Emigrations had worked and that 
somewhere out there, on distant planets under other alien suns, were other copies 
of herself but until she had stepped out from the Emigration machine herself,
stepped out onto this alien planet, she hadn't really believed it worked. 
She also knew that at the moment she was arriving here the Emma she had left 
behind back on Earth still had the same burning curiosity to see another world. 
Who knows how many times she had Emigrated since.

<p class=drop><i>Outside on the street there was a sudden flurry of movement. A 
brief burst of sirens and flashing lights. An aerial
fire tender settled down into the street directly opposite the doors. Civilian cars 
raced to get out of the way of the massive vehicle before it touched down. Another 
of the giant red and yellow vehicles descended 
onto the other side of the street. Fire fighters, fully equipped, leapt down from the 
machines and started deploying equipment.
Another smaller vehicle arrived and landed near the first. The passenger, a woman in 
a dark, military uniform covered in gold braid, 
got out and flashed ID at the nearest fireman, then had a brief word with the 
fireman’s superior officer. She pointed at the Emigration reception doors, then 
gesticulated off to the sides, up and down the street. She was issuing orders, 
orders that she obviously expected the senior fireman to obey without
question.</i>

<i>“Emma?” Celia was holding onto Emma’s arm. “What the hell is going
on?”</i>

<i>“I don’t know.” said Emma. She leaned forward and tried her login
again. It was the only
thing she could think to do. The automatic doors opened and closed again, there 
was a brief burst of the cacophony of sirens and shouted orders from outside and 
then muted silence. ID in hand, the military officer was approaching the
desk.</i>

<i>“Estain, Emigration, Military Liaison,” she said crisply. “What’s the
situation here?”</i>

<i>“I’ve no idea,” said Emma. “The board's dead and….”</i>

<i>“How many people on duty?” The woman asked.</i>

<i>“Just us two.”</i>

<i>“Any clients?”</i>

<i>Emma and Celia exchanged glances.</i>

<i>“No.”</i>

<i>“No one since about three hours ago.” added Emma.</i>

<i>“So, as far as you two are aware, the building is secure and you are
the only occupants?”</i>

<i>Again Emma and Celia glanced at one another. “Yes, just the two of
us.” said Emma,
“Look what’s all this about? Is there a fire or…?”</i>

<i>Estain glanced down at the console, inserted a keycard into the
desk's maintenance
access hatch and opened it. “If you’ve got any personal items in your lockers 
you want to keep," she said over her shoulder "you have about three minutes to rescue 
them.” She pressed another keycard into a slot inside the maintenance panel and typed 
a code on the numpad. The screen on the desk came to life again. It showed an interface 
Emma had never seen before. Estain sat herself before Emma's keyboard and entered 
information into a dialogue. “Two and a half minutes!” she said, without looking up.</i>

<p class=drop>Jenny alternated between being fascinated by the mother planet and total 
disinterest. Today was obviously one of her disinterested days. Jenny was tall, tanned 
and utterly at home on this planet in a way than none of the first generation colonists 
could quite fathom. The rhythms of her body comfortable with the twenty hour day and 
five hundred day year in a way that none of the Earth-born colonists could 
match. Jenny had been the first child 
born in the colony. She was ten years old when Emma had arrived and Jenny had adopted 
her as a surrogate mother; moving in with Emma whenever she felt she needed a break 
from her real parents.  
Jenny may have been the first child born on the planet but she wasn’t the last. The 
population of the colony was growing. Soon it would be too large for the island and 
there were conflicting ideas about what to do about the situation. Some colonists wanted 
to expand onto the nearby shore, some wanted to set up a totally separate colony further 
away. For the most part it was the youngsters, those born on the planet, who wanted to 
move away. Alvi, Emma, and Jenny were looking for a possible new home.

<p class= drop><i>Emma opened her drawer, took out the picture of her husband Alvi 
holding their daughter Francesca and shoved it in her bag. Celia seemed to be emptying 
a vast number of lipsticks and nail varnishes into her pockets.</i>

<p class=drop>“How much further are we going to go on?” asked Alvi. “I know a lot 
of the youngsters back on the island 
want to be as far away from us wrinklies as you can get but we’ve been 
out here – what? Fifteen weeks?”

“Ten.”

“Either way, it’s far too far away to set up a daughter colony.”

“You told me you went to Mars when you left home for the first time - that’s another planet!” 
said Jenny with adolescent finality.

“I know, but…” Alvi floundered on the impossibility of explaining to Jenny, who had never 
known the highly urbanised, intricate mechanism of Earth society, that the complex 
transport infrastructure of the Solar System meant it was more relevant to talk about 
time between destinations rather than distances. It was, for instance, sometimes faster 
to get from Earth to Mars than it was to get to any of the habitats on the dark side of 
the moon which didn’t have expensive landing facilities, but which, if measured purely in 
kilometres, were far closer. 

“Sounds good to me.” said Emma. “I think we should think about turning back too. I don’t 
think we‘re going to find anything better that that last place.”

“Another island?” said Jenny. "What's wrong with the shore? We should be exploring the shore!"

“The return journey should be shorter,” said Alvi, sidestepping a familiar argument. “With 
no detours up tributaries and no mapping to do, we should be back in around three weeks.”

“Sounds about right,” agreed Emma. “The current’s slow this time of year and we do want 
to start back before the rains come."

"No bloody salinity tests to do either.” added Alvi.

“One more day?” But Jenny knew she was outvoted.

“We’ll carry on till nightfall and set off back in the morning,” said Emma handing the 
tiller back to Alvi. Jenny went off to sulk in the prow.

<p class=drop><i>“You must be wondering what is happening?” said Estain without looking 
up from her work. “This is all I am allowed to tell you. About eighty years ago military 
long range observers spotted seven objects heading towards Earth. The objects are artificial, 
three kilometres long, travelling very fast, decelerating, and for the past eighty years, 
have ignored every attempt we have made to contact whatever is steering them. Two years after 
we discovered them we started the Emigration program. Three days ago the objects changed course. 
and, unless they change course again, 
should be in Earth orbit in twenty-four hours.”</i>

<i>Emma started to say something but, before she could speak, the
liaison officer held up a finger
as a warning not to interrupt. A few more keystrokes and she was finished. She turned. 
“And now,” she said with the tone of voice that suggested a job well done, “I would suggest 
we get the hell out of here before the place explodes.”</i>

<p class=drop>Jenny sat on the edge of the boat, watching the dense jungle slide slowly past. 
In return, nesting birds, lethargic in the midday sun, watched her from branches of giant 
trees. In the perpetual near-seasonless summer of the jungle, some of the trees were flowering, 
while others were heavy with fruit. Occasionally a mudfish, startled by the strange alien thing 
gliding down its river, would struggle back into the water with a slap. Sudden ripples disturbing 
the still waters. A cloud of floating, feathery, airborne seeds drifted by.

Alvi came to the side of the boat with a bucket in his hand. He lowered it into the water. 
It tipped and filled.

"Alvi?" Jenny said.

"Mmm?"

"Why are you here?" she said. "I mean, I'm here because I was born here, but..." 
she hesitated. "What's your excuse? Why did you Emigrate?"

Alvi sat, happy to take a break from the tedium of routine water sampling. In all the 
time they had been on the planet they had yet to discover a single water-borne 
pathogen but the search for dangers never ceased. Alvi pondered Jenny's question for a 
moment. It was a question he had often asked himself. The answer changed.

"All sorts of reasons," he said. "I can't remember the exact one that made me do it. 
I was bored with what I was. Needed to prove to myself I could do something with my 
life, scared I was never going to... Maybe I was running away. All of them. None of 
them. Take your pick. I don't know any more. I just hope I got what I wanted out of 
doing it."

"You got me," said Emma, joining them. "And the baby."

Alvi patted Emma's belly. Four months pregnant and just starting to show. "I know and I 
love you both," he said. "I wouldn't go back even if I could. I'm talking about the 
other me. The me who didn't come here. The me that walked out of the Emigration Centre 
and went home. I wonder if he got what he wanted from my coming here."

"I always felt good about it," said Emma.

Jenny laughed. "That's what amazes me about you," she said. "You can happily live with 
the fact that there are different... 'yous' out there. All those different versions of 
you, right now, all over the sky. Dozens of them. Doesn't it feel weird? Knowing that 
somewhere out there there are dozens of copies of you having totally different lives."

"I don't know about dozens," said Emma. "But at least four."

"And me," said Alvi. "I could have volunteered again, and so could you. She's right; 
there might well be dozens of us out there."

Emma kissed Alvi on the nose. "Dozens of Alvis and Emmas," she said. "And dozens of 
babies too."

"But they'd all be unique," said Jenny. "Like me. The babies are all unique. We've all 
got millions of brothers and sisters we'll never see but we're all unique." She stood 
up abruptly. The boat rocked slightly. "Don't you ever think of that?"

"I don't think she'll mind," said Emma. "Do you, baby?"

"She?" asked Alvi. "She's a 'she' today, is she?"

"She feels like a 'she' today," said Emma patting her belly.

"So we won't be calling her Genghis then?"

"No! ...and we're not calling her Genghis if she's a boy either!" exclaimed Emma in 
mock horror.

"Elvis then!"

"No!"

"Toshiro?"

They both burst into laughter. A moment later Jenny joined them, her mood swinging back 
as it inevitably did when she was with them.

"I love you two," she said.

The laughter subsided and the three of them sat quietly for a while watching the 
seeds of the dandelion trees drifting overhead.

They anchored at sundown.

Later, when they had all eaten, locked everything down for the night, and Emma was 
already asleep, Alvi took a final tour round the deck. Jenny was sitting on a storage 
locker, looking up into the sky. From east to west a vast crescent of light, a whole 
arm of the galaxy, reached out across the darkness.

Jenny continued to stare upwards as Alvi approached.

"What do you think they get out of it?" she said.

"'They'? You mean Earth?" He paused. "I don't really know," he said slowly. "I've 
often wondered that myself. We can't communicate with them, can't tell them what 
we've found... I don't know."

"It must have cost Earth a lot to send you all out here," said Jenny. "All those people 
on all those planets. Must have cost a fortune. What does Earth get out of it all?"

"Why should they get anything?" said Alvi.

Jenny snorted. "Oh come on, Alvi. I've read the history books. Every time people have 
gone anywhere new it's because they want something. Something they can exploit, turn 
into cash. And whoever paid for them to go looking always expected some sort of return 
for their investment. Isabella didn't fund Columbus because she thought he was a nice 
man. She wanted the money and power that a short route to India could give her. No. I 
just can't see what's in it for Earth"

Alvi looked up, wondering for the thousandth time which of the stars out there was the 
Sun. The stars slowly turned in the cloudless sky and they watched them in silence.
"Maybe they're not getting anything out of it," he said eventually. "Maybe the human 
race is doing something purely because it's the right thing to do. Maybe we've finally 
grown up." He shivered. "It's getting cold. I'm turning in. Coming?"

She shook her head. "I'll be down soon."

"Okay," he said. "Just don't forget to turn off the lights and activate the motion 
detectors before you do."

Still gazing upward Jenny murmured that she wouldn't forget.

"Night," said Alvi and went below.

When they woke in the morning, the lights were on, the motion detectors were off, and 
Jenny was gone. She'd left a note.

'Don't look for me. I'll be all right.
Go home and I'll see you soon.
Love Jenny'

She'd taken supplies, a share of the dried food, a rifle, and her survival pack.

Alvi and Emma spent three days looking for her. They found her trail and followed it. 
It led back inland, away from the river, deeper into the jungle. Totally unexplored 
country. On the third day they found a note pinned to a tree in a place where it was 
impossible for anyone following her trail to miss.
 
'I'll be all right.
Look after the baby.
Jenny.'

Emma read the note and cried. Alvi held her. After a while he said, "Come on. 
Let's go home," and they turned and went back the way they had come.

<p class=drop><i>As they hurried through the doors into the night Emma had the 
absurd urge to lock the doors behind her. She couldn’t of course, there were no 
locks; Emigration was always open. Had always been open. When she reached the 
line of fire crew standing by their machines she turned. The lights were still on, 
and as she watched a ripple of muffled explosions shuddered the building. The air 
beyond the glass windows was suddenly opaque with smoke and dust. As she watched, 
flames burst through the building.</i>

<i>It was a scene played out all over the system, images of Emigration
offices
on fire were being carried on every news channel. Outside every Emigration office, 
fire crews and the office staff, bemused bystanders, and news crews watched as they 
were razed to the ground. Flames and sparks flew skyward between surrounding buildings 
as the delicate, intricate web of quantum entanglements that spread out across the universe 
shattered and evaporated, leaving no trace.</i>

<p class=drop>Earth’s children were alone now. Scattered across the sky and nothing could follow them 
to where they had been hidden.

[*BLURB] Prototype
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p><I><b>She</b></I> was my experiment. Once I came
to this
new land &#8211; this island
where the Saxons ruled and their inbred descendants now dwell in smog
and filth &#8211; I knew I would have to be careful and proceed with
matters delicately.</p> 
<p>Blood is potent. Blood is power.</p> 
<p>Too little blood and you make little more than a revenant: a rotting
brute or a mindless hungry doll. Too much blood and you can create a
twisted	voracious fiend more obvious and even more powerful than
anything even the Scholomance can put down again. My wives are a
testament to the latter. I do not think of the former much.</p> 
<p>I
will rule this
absurd little island of coal-fired steam trains and
gaslights. I will take
its Empire
and dominate the world. I have plans and contingencies in place. These
are the easy parts. Centuries of existence can afford one a certain
amount of&#8230; patience and perspective.</P>
<p>Yet even that has not
been enough to perfect my bloodline. Even now, she wanders around in her
grave dress: abducting children and little babies. That is how they all
begin. My Lambton Worm, my poor White Lady. She was so alive and
vivacious when I first found her. She was strong. She had hungers and
appetites that gave her potential.</p> 
<p>We all go through this stage.
The &#8220;child-brain,&#8221; so-called experts like Van Helsing call
it. Granted, it is like a second childhood but I remember all of my
memories and strengths from my previous life. I know where my power
lies.</p> 
<p>My women in Romania have barely evolved &#8211; evolution
being a very quaint English notion &#8211; from this state. And it seems
<em>she</em> will be no different. Perhaps it was a mistake draining and
turning her within her somnambulist state. I toyed with her: changing
her mindset slowly&#8230; carefully. Certainly her sleepwalking made
her more suggestible and from the biological and alienist texts
I&#8217;d gathered, sleepwalking puts the brain into another, more
malleable state of consciousness or subconsciousness.</P>
<p>Unfortunately, manipulation of the blood is not a precise science and
more like the alchemy with which
 I was once so adept. She is more&#8230;
quiet than the others: almost docile by comparison. I wanted to make a
new dominant personality for her: to create a being like me
&#8211; strong
and intelligent &#8211; but bound to my will. A worthy consort.</P>
<p>Sadly, her willful personality did not translate over well. Even when
I give this white-robed revenant more of my essence, she only spouts
more gibberish. She even <em>thinks</em> gibberish: though it is
fascinating to see that insanity pierce the realms of time just as her
existence does life and death. As such, her state does tend to give me
good&#8230; insight, I&#8217;ll grant one that. She is tied strongly to
the ancient and fragmented spirit of this land.</p> 
<p>But no matter.
She is an interesting experiment and I believe a good step in the right
direction.</p> 
<p>I must perfect my new race upon this Empire. I do not
want mere shades of people, but greater, more intelligent beings: beings
worthy of my blood and power. Of my will. Even the sheep here have among
them those that know the weak must always be ruled by the strong.</P>
<p>Yet, as I said, my blue-eyed lady is merely an experiment, a
&#8220;prototype&#8221; as some in the &#8220;auto-mobile&#8221;
industry call their own inventions. It is her friend I&#8217;m now more
interested in. The dark one. Jonathan Harker&#8217;s woman. She is
strong and very intelligent.</p> <p>I think after I&#8217;m done with my
little doll, she will do nicely.</p>
