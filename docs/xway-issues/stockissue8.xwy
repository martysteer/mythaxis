[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>Unusually, I am starting this issue with my editorial.
This is because I need to prepare the reader for the feast of delights
in issue 8 of Mythaxis.

Mythaxis continues to expand its readership without resort to cheap
tricks and vampire movie reviews. We do not publish to a deadline, and
can afford to wait until the right stories come along, which they have
done in this issue once again.

In particular, Les Sklaroff, lifelong writer of very short fiction, has
supplied us with two unlikely tales, "Conspiracy Theory" and "Spawn" and
he promises more delights in our next issue.

Martin Clark unleashes another excellent  story - "The Great Divide" - a
thriller within a fantasy within a mystery.

This issue's featured science fiction author of old is Lester Linesmith.
There is an 'original' story from Linesmith together with an incisive
biography of this pillar of the pulp era by Liam Baldwin. Liam's movie
blog was recently highlighted by BBC Radio 4's Film programme. (He
specialises in what you might call B-movies, or C-movies, if there were
such a category).

"The Prophets Speak", from Andrew Leon Hudson, carries a clever idea to an
ingenious extreme.

The chilling "Outpatients", from Jonathan Joseph, completes this issue.
You will not readily forget the pictures he leaves in your minds.

And where would we be without a cartoon from Liam Baldwin? Answers on a
postcard, please.<P>

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>"By the headbone of Quelg," raged Mudhurler,  "No spawn
of this mire will be refused Instruction.  Which of you approached the
Node?"  

Furling my tertiary sensors I boldly slid forward.  "I did, your
Frenziedness.  I am Stonescatterer, eggfellow of Clutchpod, Sidler,
Weedseeker and Highhoot."  I spat politely towards their respective
basal fins as I gave their names.  

Mudhurler acknowledged them with a
surly puckering.. "And did you make proper obeisance to the Nodekeeper, young eggling?"

"Most assuredly.  Levelling my tongue at the horizon I slunk along the
Nodal Path, following the concealed pattern of reversible primes, all
permissible sensors extended, remembering to make the five gyrations
which mimic the motion of the setting moons."

"No less than custom requires," growled Mudhurler.  "Yet you were denied
access, I'm told?"  There was an uneasy murmuring among the gathered
onlookers.  Mudhurler shrank to his densest configuration, swivelled
slowly, voiding an unsavoury admonitory pulse.  The murmuring abruptly
ceased.										

"Sadly so, O Agitated One."

Reconfiguring, he shuffled close to me.  "Tell me, eggling, what were the Nodekeeper's exact words?"

Curling my topmost cilia in embarrassment, I quietly repeated what the
Nodekeeper had told me.  Mudhurler became truly infuriated.  His
mouthsac bubbled, several headbulbs flushed through permutations of
grey, and a violent mottling spread to the tips of his fins. For a time
he bulged and thrashed uncontrollably, and we all slithered to a safer
distance until his fury had subsided.  Eventually he simply dismissed
the entire gathering with an exasperated retch and a peremptory flick of
his tails.

<p class=drop>Afterwards, back in the comfortably dank seclusion of our matted
homepod, there was inevitably a clamorous demand to know what it was the
Nodekeeper had said.  I prevaricated.  I feigned loss of memory
resulting from Mudhurler's spectacular fit of wrath.  I tried to
distract them with a recitation of Mistsucker's Theorem, normally a
guaranteed soporific.  Futile efforts; they were too excited, too eager
to learn, as was only to be expected.  I realised that I would be
granted no rest until their curiosity was satisfied, so in the end,
reluctantly, I had to tell them.  But oh, the impudence of eggfellows!
They laughed.  By the headbone of Quelg, they laughed!

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB]Needless to say, the Mounties don't always get their man.
 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>It wasn't a survivable explosion.

I kept well within the tree line, in case this hadn't been an accident
and there was someone out there, viewing their handiwork. Even from my
limited vantage point it was obvious that the underground petrol tank
had gone off like a bomb, levelling Bob's Food & Fuel. The diesel tank
was still burning though, sending up a thick column of smoke into the
wintry sky, like some latter day funeral pyre. I'd half expected there
to be crows circling in the early morning sky, waiting for the flames to
die down, but I guess they didn't like their meat that well done.
British Columbia looked cold, empty and uninviting. 

So much for the anonymity of witness protection. 

<div class=pullquote>I figure a small
incendiary in the last fuel delivery, pumped straight into the tank.
Probably on a long timer, a real hands-off operation.</div>Hollis and
Barnes came walking up the slope
towards me, leaving no
footprints in the fresh snow. They were semi-transparent until close up,
when they kind of slid into focus, crunching to a halt in front of me. 

There was a moment's embarrassed silence before Barnes spoke. "Well,
this is a real pain in the butt, eh? At least you're still in one piece
though."

I gave him what I hoped was a sympathetic smile. "Yeah, well, not much I
can say, given the circumstances. Really tough break, given you only had
a few days before I was left to my own devices. Ah, any idea what
happened?"

Barnes stroked his chin. "There was an explosion, about three a.m. The-"

"Two explosions." Hollis cut in. "Both tanks, I figure. The whole place
just got swept away."

I frowned. "Deliberate then. How do you think it was done?"

The two Mounties exchanged glances. Hollis shrugged. "No way anyone
could have gotten close enough to plant something without one of us
noticing. I mean, it's not like we were ever that busy. I figure a small
incendiary in the last fuel delivery, pumped straight into the tank.
Probably on a long timer, a real hands-off operation. You were due back
hours ago, so the delay saved your life."

I nodded, distracted. "Yeah, I had some, ah, personal business in Edge
City after my dental appointment."

Barnes grinned. "You mean the masseuse in Portland Street, above the
Hanoi Barbers?"

I cleared my throat, feeling my face go red, but Hollis saved me any
further embarrassment.

"It's no biggie, we've always known about your visits to Nancy. Stuck
out here you weren't likely to meet anyone socially, and that's a fact.
Did you really think that Anderson wouldn't keep tabs on you?" He
frowned, "Where <i>is</i> Anderson, anyway?"

"You've been bleeding," Barnes cut in, "a scalp wound, right side. It's
been tended to. I can see a Band-Aid under your cap."

I raised my hand but felt nothing through the glove, although my head
did smart when prodded. The mention of my escort made me look round.
"Anderson? I don't know. I'm not sure. He must have stayed with the car
when we saw the smoke and I came up here to take a look."

Both men drew their firearms on reflex, a futile gesture which I didn't
comment on. Hollis kept his voice level, with only a little tension
showing through the self-control.

"No, that doesn't sound right. At the first sign of trouble Anderson
would have gotten you well away, let alone send you up here to
investigate. Don't you remember what happened?"   

I frowned, realising the immediate past was a blur. All I could grasp
were brief images, like some esoteric trailer for the film version of my
day out. "We rear-ended someone, a pickup truck, at the lights, on our
way back. I banged my head. No seatbelt. I got cleaned up someplace, the
rest room at the bus station, maybe. After that it's all a bit hazy."

"You could be concussed. As soon as the emergency services get here you
should be hospitalised and checked out in case of cranial bleeding. I'm
surprised they're not here already, that smoke must be visible for
miles."

"Still doesn't explain what happened to Anderson." Barnes had an edge to
his voice, almost an accusatory tone. 

"Look, guys, sorry. I simply don't know. Maybe he spotted someone
following us and stashed me here, then took off to act as a decoy."

That sounded weak, even to me. Luckily at that point the faint sound of
an approaching siren reached us, heading off any further speculation.
Barnes looked down towards the road, keeping behind what sparse cover
the pine trees afforded.

"RCMP out of Mountain Gap. Probably. I'd stay put until either the fire
service or an ambulance shows up. Preferably the fire service as it's
harder to fake. Still, it looks like you're on your way out of here."

There was an awkward silence until Hollis cleared his throat. "So, what
happens to us now?"

I resisted the impulse to shrug. "Sorry, guys, but that's the kind of
thing you ask a priest. I was able to bring you back, but it's only
temporary. I don't know where you go from here. I've heard of people
being brought back two, three, times, but what you get is less and less,
ah, coherent. It's a kind of psychic Alzheimer's and I've no idea if it
affects you once you do, ah, pass over."

Barnes put away his gun and stretched. "You ready, Hollis? I've never
been one for long goodbyes."

Hollis nodded but remained silent, thin-lipped. We shook hands and I
stepped back, letting them go. Both men became transparent,
indistinct, and were gone. Gone like the fading memory of a dream,
but one that left footprints in front of me.

I shivered and suddenly felt hungry, as the concentration required to
summon the dead burns me out like heavy exercise. Some of those I've
brought back cling to the moment, desperate for whatever extra time I
can offer, and cutting them loose tears at my very soul. At least when
I'm dealing with the police they generally have an underlying
realisation of how badly things can turn out. Not fatalistic, exactly,
more a grim acceptance that the chance of violent death goes with the
territory, and that's enough to make the transition a good deal easier.

It started to snow - large, lazy flakes that drifted like blossom in the
still air. One landed on my upturned face and stung for a moment, then
faded like a lost soul.

<p class=drop>I waited until all the emergency services had arrived
before leaving the trees and floundering down the slope. The snow was
knee deep in places and my legs were chilled long before I reached the
road. At least I recognised one of the Mounties watching my approach;
big Pete Frobisher, a regular at Bob's as it was one of the few places
on this road you could get a cup of coffee after hours. Although I'd
owned the place less than a month you make friends quick up here, or not
at all. 

As I struggled up the gravel bank he held out his hand. "Don! Hell of a
thing, eh? What happened here?"

I'd been chewing over what to say and decided to write Anderson out of
the scenario.  I couldn't account for his absence and didn't think he'd
have spent the night nearby only to hang back now. "Damned if I know,
Pete. Something woke me around three and when I went out back there was
a bear nosing around. Great big beast, raking through the trash. Anyway,
you know how I'm still taken by the novelty of life out here so I just
hunkered down to watch it a while. Next thing I know its like a bomb
went off. Huge blast, the buildings went down like a house of cards. I
figured it was the underground gasoline tank, but I didn't fancy getting
close enough to check it out."

"Yeah, that's what it looks like. Electrical fault maybe, if the pumps
had been left on. Look, who else was here? The fire department are all
for letting the diesel tank burn itself out, as there's no risk to life
or property. We can't get near the site just now, but if there are
bodies in the debris..."

He trailed off and I put on my resigned voice. "Yeah, Pete, I'm afraid
so. Bill Anderson is away in Edge City but his two friends, Ray Hollis
and Todd Barnes, were still staying with us. I don't see how they could
have survived."

"Ray Hollis? I knew an officer Ray Hollis some years back, but there you
go." He scratched his chin. "Hell of a thing, hell of a thing. We'll
need contact details, next of kin, whatever information you have
concerning the deceased."

"Can't be of much use, Pete. Like I said, they were Bill's friends, just
here to help us get up and running."

Frobisher looked over the spread of smashed and smouldering timbers.
"You were damn lucky, now that's a fact. Not getting caught in the blast
and then surviving out here all night, given as how you're not dressed
for it."

I caught the questioning tone in his voice and decided to head off that
part of the investigation, or at least buy some time. Turning, I pointed
back up at the ridge. "There's an old cabin up there, a ways back from
the tree line. Still weather tight, so I laid up there until you dragged
your sorry ass out of bed."

He followed my gesture and frowned. "Can't say as how I noticed any wood
smoke."

"It's not exactly equipped as a rescue station, Don, and I had nothing
to light a fire with. Couple of old blankets and my own company is all I
had."

He hesitated for a moment and then his stance relaxed. "Right then, you
go get checked out and I'll have the fire department start dampening
things down. There'll be an accident investigator along presently and I
guess he'll want to talk to you. And Bill, when he gets back. You'll be
staying local, I take it, until things get sorted out?"

"Ah, yeah, yeah. I expect we'll try the inn back in Mountain Gap."

"Margaret's? Brave man." He turned to go and then hesitated.
"Insurance?"

"What? Sorry?" I tried to appear flustered, caught unawares, but I knew
exactly where the conversation was going. Bob's had never been much of a
money spinner and unlikely to make us rich, so arson had to be a
consideration. "Well, we have a small safe, if it survived in one piece,
and all the documents are in that. Bill handled that side of things, so
I couldn't even tell you who the policy was with. Sorry"

Frobisher nodded, more to himself than me. "Not something to worry about
just now, Don. You go see to yourself and we'll talk later, when your
partner gets back."

I evaded his contemplative gaze and sought out the ambulance crew, who
supplied me with dry trousers and a pair of over-large boots to be going
on with. I'd barely sipped the obligatory cup of coffee when Frobisher
and another officer came over, their body language tense and formal.
Pete sounded well pissed off.

"Mr Wylie. I've been instructed to place you in protective custody. You
are to be transported immediately to the RCMP station in Edge City.
Officer Rogers will drive you there. Apparently they even considered
having you airlifted out, but there's a weather front moving in and your
safety is of paramount importance. Before you go, is there anything you
wish to add concerning recent events?"

I guessed my name, or at least my current identity, had caught the
attention of someone in higher authority and they'd decided to spirit me
away. The big no-no in witness protection is ever admitting you're part
of it, even to local law enforcement. Pete Frobisher was a decent guy
and I disliked lying to his face, but I stuck with 'bewildered
innocence' as a defence mechanism.

"I don't know what to say, Pete, honestly. Maybe Bill Anderson has
something to do with this, although I can't see how. I must have friends
in high places, eh?"

I tried a half-smile in an effort to lighten the atmosphere but no one
returned it. Pete nodded to Officer Rogers who took up position behind
me. 

"You'll be required to make a formal statement later. Good day to you,
sir."

We semi-marched over to the car and Rogers put me in back - I didn't
even rate the informality of riding shotgun. As we pulled out I saw that
the bus to Mountain Gap had stopped and a few passengers had got down to
chat with the firemen. One sallow-faced onlooker stood out, if only
because he was wearing a suit amidst uniforms and winter clothing.

Vigo Hanesh, a man I knew to be dead. Because I'd killed him.

I blinked, rubbed my eyes, and when I looked again Hanesh was gone. I
realised how tired I was, having been up all night, and relaxed. I'm
pretty much the poster boy for port-traumatic stress disorder, so
hallucinations are part and parcel of the recovery process. The only
thing that stood out was the normality of it all, it really had looked
like Hanesh standing there, gawping, not even gazing in my direction.
Satisfied I wasn't really being haunted, I sat back and tried to let
time pass.

The road meandered either side of the arrow-straight railway track which
led to Edge City, and I kept an eye out for Anderson's car as we
travelled. The gap in my memory stubbornly refused to yield any answers,
not that I was concentrating too hard. I have the kind of imagination
which will start to fill in the gaps if pushed, and I didn't want a
concocted, though plausible, scenario to block reality when it decided
to put in an appearance.

Bill's disappearance really bothered me, though, as he wasn't the type
to just bug out like that - especially if two brother officers had just
gone up in flames. Why he'd left me behind remained a mystery, and I'd
discounted the possibility he was in some way connected with the
explosion.

The miles passed, snow continued to fall. 

<p class=drop>Edge City - a fair sized settlement but not exactly what
you'd call metropolitan. The RCMP station there is stone and brick,
quite a substantial building, and as we pulled into the cinder covered
car park a sergeant stepped out of the side entrance to greet us. To
greet Constable Rodgers, actually, as they left me in the car during
their conversation, and neither man looked overly pleased when it
finished. The sergeant motioned for me to join them and I quit the tepid
security of the cruiser for wet snow and obvious irritation.

"I'm Sergeant Muldoon and you'll be staying with us for a while, Mr
Wylie. Apparently some bigwigs are flying in to question you,
although..." he looked up at an overcast sky the colour of a dead
salmon, "...that could take a while. Follow me, please."

We went inside and at least they put me an interrogation room rather
than a cell; a blank-walled box containing four chairs, a Formica-topped
table and a buzzing overhead strip light. What it lacked in amenities it
made up for with an absence of charm. I sat and waited for almost two
hours, with only one cup of coffee to break the tedium. Eventually the
door opened and a man entered; thirties, suit, tie, shoes not boots.
Short dark hair, thin mouth, close-cut fingernails. He had one blue eye
and one gray. Mr Neat placed a manila folder on the desk between us and
sat down facing me.

<div class=pullquote>It would seem you know something, the significance
of which has escaped both you and your erstwhile handlers, or they would
never have let you go in the first place.</div>"My name is Walker, Mr
Kelso..." I winced at
the use of my real name, or
rather the recent past associated with it, "...and I'm here to manage
this situation. Let me be quite clear at the outset, we only took you on
as a favour, a professional courtesy, to our British cousins. Apparently
at some point you had expressed a desire to see Canada and, quite
frankly, they wanted rid of you. Naturally we requested a copy of your
file, in case your presence here posed a threat to our national
security, but what we received was so heavily redacted as to be almost
useless. The most we could glean was that you were a compromised
intelligence asset they wished to protect from any potential
retribution, as compensation for services rendered. We, in turn, passed
you over to the RCMP witness protection program, who undertook to
provide you with a suitably low-profile lifestyle here in British
Columbia." He opened the file and scanned the first page before
continuing. "The result of all this time and effort being two officers
feared dead and a third missing, your place of residence reduced to
matchwood, and you sitting here without a scratch."      

Instinctively I raised a hand to the Band Aid on my head, but given what
had happened to Hollis and Barnes I decided not to make a big deal of
it. "Sorry, Mr Walker, but who are you again?"

"CSIS." I must have looked blank because he sighed, exasperation written
clearly on his face. "Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Look,
Kelso, the RCMP, or at least those in the know, want you turned over for
questioning. I've read the initial report from the scene of the
explosion and there's no indication this was other than a tragic
accident. So normally we wouldn't concern ourselves, as even those in
witness protection have the right to blow themselves up through
incompetence."

He sat there, his composure recovered, waiting for some response from
me. I cleared my throat, trying not to sound as nervous as I felt. "So I
take it something happened to make this out of the ordinary?"

He turned to another page in the file. "Around the estimated time of the
explosion we, not the RCMP, received a phone call. Just a name, 'Donald
Wylie', from an untraceable cell phone. We're working on that. Obviously
the call red-flagged your file so when formal notification of your
involvement reached us we decided to take charge, regardless of the
preliminary evidence."

"So, now what? I get moved on? Another identity, another out-of-the-way
spot?"

Walker smiled, although it was more a 'problem solved' satisfaction than
genuine good humour. "No. The good news for us is that you obviously
still pose a threat to someone out there, so as an active intelligence
asset you're being handed back to the British. Internal flight to
Calgary and then direct to Glasgow, as soon as the weather improves.
Hell, if it doesn't improve in the next eight hours I'll drive you out
of here myself."

There was a hard knot in my stomach at the prospect of being thrown back
into a life I'd barely survived the first time around. "Someone wants to
kill me? This is good news for us, how, exactly?"

"Sorry, Kelso, I was using 'us' in the sense of 'not you'. Sorry for any
confusion. Look, if someone wanted you dead they would just walk up and
put a bullet in your head, or use a car bomb. Something obvious,
especially if it made the point that witness protection couldn't shield
you. The problem with that approach is it would trigger a mandatory
investigation by the RCMP into how they found you, and, more
importantly, a review by the intelligence community of those cases you
were involved with. It would seem you know something, the significance
of which has escaped both you and your erstwhile handlers, or they would
never have let you go in the first place."

He sat back, looking slightly smug, and I could feel a pit opening up
beneath me. I had no desire to plunge back into that twilight existence
of scorn, disbelief and half-truths. Walker closed the file and while he
didn't exactly wipe his hands clean, the inference was there.  

"So, you're out of here ASAP, Kelso. Unless you can come up with a damn
good reason for us to keep you around."

Now it was my turn to sit back, hands in my lap and out of his sight.
His gaze hardened as he tried to work out why my eyes were fluttering,
obviously worried I was experiencing some kind of fit. I showed him the
pair of Enfield .38 revolvers I was now holding. 

He took it quite well, all things considered. When I pull a stunt like
that, there's always the chance my audience will try and jump me or go
for their own weapon. As I didn't know Walker's background he could have
been one of those taught to regain the initiative, regardless of risk,
and that could have been very messy. 

Producing the revolvers had been the easy bit and now I had to
stage-manage the aftermath. I ducked the guns under the table and jumped
to my feet, showing him my now empty hands. For good measure I raised
them above my head, as I knew how this was going to play out in the
short term.

Walker jerked upright like a puppet on a string, Glock materialising in
his hand like one of those quick-draw guns strapped to your forearm. He
wasn't pleased. "Preston! King! In here now!"

The door burst open and two other men in suits appeared, guns drawn. All
three covered me while I stood there, arms up, trying not to smile.
Walker gestured with his firearm. "Preston, frisk him. King, look for
weapons taped to the undersides of the table and chairs."

They went through the motions while Walker slammed the door shut and
stood with his back against it, fuming.

"He's clean."

"Nothing here either, sir. No weapons of any kind."

There was a tic in Walker's left cheek and I wondered if I'd pushed him
too far. "Get out. Both of you. Make sure no-one disturbs us."

His two associates exchanged glances. "Sir, perhaps it would be best
if-"

"I said get out!"

Neither man actually shrugged, but the way they holstered their weapons
and left the room gave me the definite impression this interview was
heading into the realm of 'no witnesses required'.

Walker and I stood for a moment, facing each other, and then he seemed
to regain his composure. "Sit down, Kelso, and keep your hands where I
can see them. " We returned to our chairs and he placed his Glock on the
table in easy reach.  "So, neat trick. What was it, some kind of
subliminal suggestion? If it was a straightforward illusion then you've
obviously missed your calling."

Despite his warning I reached inside my jacket and pulled out a Glock.
Walker went white-faced, trembling, and for a moment it looked like he
might go berserk. I slowly reached over and placed the pistol on the
table in front of him. "Pick it up, Walker. It's your gun, after all."

He stared at the new weapon and then lifted both, one in each hand, to
inspect them. I saw his knuckles tighten. "The serial numbers match. You
could only have pulled this off in collusion with my superiors. Which
means this whole incident has been contrived from
start to finish." He pointed both guns at me. "Care to tell me just what
the hell is going on?"

I tried to keep my voice soft and reassuring. "Put the second gun down,
out of my reach. It isn't going to be here for long."

The tic in his cheek had returned but his eyes were hard, locked on
mine. Nevertheless he placed the duplicate Glock down and sat back, so
as to keep both it and me in plain sight.

The gun wavered, became transparent, and was gone.

<p class=drop>Walker was breathing heavily, a trickle of sweat running
from the hairline down past his right ear, but the gun in his hand
didn't waver. When he spoke I could hear the strain of a man barely
under control. "You've got ten seconds. Then you attack me and I'm
forced to shoot. Ten."

Despite the countdown I hesitated, as I have a set spiel to explain what
I do, but generally not in front of so hostile an audience. I opted for
the cut-down version. "Ideas exist. Ideas of people, of places, of
things. They exist in what Jung called the collective unconscious. Like
a sea, a pool of ideas shared by everyone. Everything that people think
about, dream about, in a place where they exist independently of the
real world, the conscious world. I'm able to tap into this place and
make these ideas real, for a while at least."

Walker flexed his fingers, getting a better grip on the Glock. "Nine.
And that's bullshit. Try again."

I could feel sweat on my brow. "If enough people believe in something,
in an idea of something, then it exists as, as a tangible entity in the
collective unconscious. Some of us can get in there and, ah, replicate
the physical form of that idea in the here and now."

Walker frowned. "What, you thought up those two revolvers? Out of
nothing?"

I leaned forward, trying to sound eager and trustworthy. "No, no, I saw
them coming in here, in a display case. Look, the more people believe in
something the more real it becomes in our world. I couldn't keep those
guns here for long because only a few people know about them. Same with
your Glock. The idea of it was nearby, in a manner of speaking, because
it featured so prominently in your mind. Conscious and unconscious. What
you saw, and touched, was the idea, the ideal, of your gun. Its pure
form."

Walker sneered at me. "Parlour tricks. It's nothing more than mental
conjuring, even if I believed it was true. Get a stage act together and
impress the gullible."

I sat back, suddenly feeling weary of banging my head against a wall of
official scepticism. "While objects are here, they're real. If you'd
shot me with that second Glock I'd be just as dead as if you'd used the
original. Of course forensics would have a field day, as the bullet
would match the remaining gun which hadn't been fired."

"So, what? You were some kind of assassin for the British? Or maybe an
armourer, able to supply temporary weapons inside high security
environments?"

I shook my head. "There was a man called Vigo Hanesh. He produced, he
made real, the bomb which destroyed the American embassy in London. Then
all forensic trace of the device simply vanished, although the effects
of the explosion were permanent." 

Walker stared at me. "You can do this? Manufacture ordnance out of
thin air?"

"No, nothing so major, and Hanesh is dead, so that threat is gone. My
fear is that someone is about to attempt something similar, and they
want me out of the way so they won't be traced. Imaginary weapons, the
next big thing." I gave Walker a half-smile. "You can't fight an idea
whose time has come."

Walker looked sceptical, obviously torn between assessing my supposed
abilities logically and dismissing the whole thing out of hand. He
pulled a tissue from his jacket, left handed, and wiped his face, while
still keeping me covered. "Back up a bit, Kelso. You said you traced
this Hanesh, so you'd be able to find who was behind this latest
explosion?"

This was the tricky bit and I tried not to shrug. "Not directly, no. Not
like I could give you an address. With Hanesh it was more like I could
get a sense of the man, what was important to him, that kind of thing. I
could produce small objects that were significant to him, like I did
with your Glock. All these clues were turned over to the true
investigators, and they were able to put together a picture of where
Hanesh was in the real world. They found him. He died."

Walker snorted. "You sound like some kind of psychic skip-tracer. So why
can't you do the same bloodhound act now?"

"The big advantage with Hanesh was having access to his dreams. When
they raided his address in London they found a Sony Dreamcatcher down
the side of the sofa. Just a short sequence on it, some kind of empty
nightclub interior, but it was enough to use as a starting point."

"So you're saying you already need to know the who before coming up with
an idea of where? Not really that useful, and I can see why the British
let you walk. Except that you obviously do know who the next terrorist
will be, right? Which is why you're top of someone's hit list,
apparently." 

Walker holstered his gun and flexed his neck, looking a good deal more
relaxed. "Anyway, Kelso, this is all just supposition. If you can't be
of any direct use to us I'm inclined to send you packing, regardless of
what the RCMP want. Are we clear?"

I cleared my throat. There was one last card I could play, but I very
much doubted it would increase my credibility in Walker's eyes. "Ah,
Hollis and Barnes, the two RCMP officers who died at the scene, they
confirmed the blast wasn't accidental. Two explosions, one in each fuel
tank."

Walker frowned and flipped open the file again. "I was given to
understand they died instantaneously. Are you now saying they survived
long enough for you to reach them? Can Anderson confirm this?"

"No, no, it was, ah, more in the way of a port-mortem conversation."

He looked at me, his eyes blank. "Now you're saying you can talk to the
dead? Which particular mental institution were you in, back in England?
I just ask so I can write and tell them what a bang-up job they did
prior to your release back into the community. Jesus!"

I knew this next bit would be hard to explain. If not downright
impossible. "No, no, not the dead per se, more the idea of who they were
while alive." 

There was silence. Walker licked his lips. "Is that supposed to make any
kind of sense? Even in whatever version of reality you currently
inhabit?"

<div class=pullquote>It's no wonder your case file
was so heavily censored or we'd never have touched you in a million
years.</div>
I sighed and let my shoulders sag. "Look, Walker, I'll explain this once
and you can believe me or not. There's a version of everyone in the
collective unconscious, a composite, an amalgam of who we believe
ourselves to be and what others think of us. Obviously how close it is
to reality depends on the trade-off between your ego on the one hand and
public perception on the other. If you're a high-profile media
personality and the world in general thinks you're a twat, then this
idea of you will predominate."

He sneered at me. "So if you're a worthless nonentity living in
obscurity..."

I shook my head. "Not necessarily. That's why psychopaths, real
out-and-out ego-maniacs, are so dangerous in the unconscious - but
you're missing the point."

"Which is?"

"Everything which Hollis and Barnes experienced, including their own
deaths, influenced, informed, their unconscious selves. I was able to
reproduce this idea of them, for a short while, long enough to get some
idea of what happened, at least." 

Walker drummed his fingers on the table, frowning. "Not exactly evidence
that would stand up in court. Unless you can summon up these apparitions
at will?"

Again I shook my head. "No, strictly a short-term window of opportunity.
The version of someone in the collective unconscious continues to exist
while others remember them, but once an individual accepts they're dead
it starts to, to atrophy. Gradually the dead become a collection of
knee-jerk reactions and predictable aphorisms. Sad but true."

"And if someone refuses to accept that they're dead, regardless of all
evidence to the contrary?"

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. "Well, I suppose..."

"Kelso? You feeling all right? You've gone white as a sheet."

I felt sick to my stomach at the idea forming in my mind. "Look, Walker,
there have always been rumours of objects materialising, just popping
into being. Objects that were the focus of intense and widespread
belief, as if the very concept of them was so real they became real." I
wiped my mouth. "If someone was egotistical enough, and enough peopled
believed in him, I suppose...no, it can't be."

Some of the fear in my voice obviously rubbed off and Walker lapsed into
an aggressive posture, leaning towards me, eyes fixed on mine. "What
can't be? Out with it, man!"

I felt helpless, my mouth filled with the taste of ashes. "Vigo Hanesh.
It's the idea of Vigo Hanesh, making itself real."

<p class=drop>Walker slapped me, the sound gunshot-loud in the small
room. I jerked in my seat, half raising a hand to my cheek, blinking
rapidly.

"Enough of this nonsense, Kelso. Pull yourself together, for God's sake.
You were becoming hysterical." He switched to a rational, encouraging
tone of voice. "Look, are you quite sure that Hanesh is dead?"

I nodded. "Oh yes. I killed him."

Walker looked at me for a long, hard moment. "Really? I didn't have you
down as a field operative. There's nothing in your file to suggest you
were employed in anything other than an intelligence gathering role."

I felt my hands tremble at the memory and clenched my fists to quell
them. "Hanesh turned up on my doorstep one evening, in London, with a
bottle of wine to celebrate tracking me down. He started going on about
how it was a classic vintage and the... the normality of it just freaked
me out. I went a bit berserk, ended up stabbing him through the eye with
a corkscrew. Superhuman strength they said." I gave him a nervous smile.
"Not really me. I couldn't work after that, after watching Hanesh die."

"Oh yes? And the authorities were quite happy this was the real Hanesh?
Not some stand-in or close relative? It's a damn sight easier to believe
he faked his own death than the idea of a larger-than-life ghost
stalking you, intent on revenge."  Walker sat back and rubbed his eyes.
"Don't bother answering that, I'm sure my British and American
counterparts are competent enough. Look, at this moment I'm inclined to
hand you over to our psych boys and let them sort out fact from fantasy.
It's obvious you can pull some kind of mental slight-of-hand, but I'm
not going to issue an all-points for someone who, in all probability, is
safely dead and buried. I just don't see how the memory of someone, no
matter how vivid it might be in the minds of others, can possibly affect
us here in the real world."

I could almost hear the 'case closed' suffix to that statement, a
finality ripe with the promise of institutionalised hell. It had been a
real struggle to avoid a lifetime of padded rooms and restraint, and I
didn't relish the prospect of going through it again on this side of the
Atlantic. I held up a hand.

"No, please, just listen for a moment! Even the idea of Hanesh can pose
a threat, a deadly threat. That's what I meant when I said that
psychopaths can be dangerous. Their ego, their sense of self, can
transcend death and create a kind of bubble of reality in which they're
still alive. A true ego-maniac simply refuses to accept the world can
exist without them and so they-"

"Do you actually listen to what you come out with?" Walker cut across
me, his patience clearly exhausted. "Transcending death? Bubbles of
reality? Give me something concrete to work with or I'll skip the
funny-farm and ship you back to the British, air-freight."

I hesitated, knowing how this was going to sound. "Let me sleep on it."

"What?"

"Let me sleep on it. Let me see if the memory of Hanesh is just that, a
memory, a fixed idea, or something more."

Walker stared at me. "You want to have a nap? In the middle of a murder
investigation with potential terrorist involvement?"

"It's what I do, it's how I do it. Directed dreaming. It's how I can
trace someone through the ideas they consider important. If the memory
of Hanesh is, is alive, for want of a better term, then he'll be bloody
easy to find. It'll only take an hour or so, and if he's not real I'll
get out of your hair ASAP. Hell, I'll even pay for my flight back to the
UK. Sounds fair?"

"It sounds ludicrous. Directed dreaming? It's no wonder your case file
was so heavily censored or we'd never have touched you in a million
years." He paused, drumming his fingers on the table. "Thirty minutes. I
can give you thirty minutes and then you're out of here, one way or the
other."

"Thanks, I-"

A raised hand cut me off. "But you can forget flaking out in what passes
for hotel accommodation here. It'll be a cell, under guard." He smiled,
"After all, you're still in protective custody." Walker stood and raised
his voice. "King! Tell Sergeant Muldoon I want to speak to him."

I tried to tune out the next few minutes, not exactly a Zen state but
simply ignoring my surroundings as far as possible. Muldoon, a corridor,
a blank-walled cell, a cot, the door closing. I closed my eyes,
concentrating on the images inside my eyelids. Letting them lead me down
a route I knew from memory...

I started near the bar, with its long under-lit glass counter to my
right and the row of floor-length windows to my left. There was very
little in the way of other illumination apart from down at my left ankle
where a steady source, diffused by the gauze curtains, filled my
peripheral vision. I assumed this was from a street light rather than
passing traffic and I wasn't conscious of any vehicle noise despite it
being early evening. The blonde woman in the pale grey halter-neck dress
passed me and I started walking away from the light, still conscious of
the windows beside me and the dark, empty space of the seating area now
stretching out opposite.

The memories of Vigo Hanesh, as recorded on his Dreamcatcher. Memories I
had accessed so often they were now mine, a way to access whatever trace
remained of the man in humanity's collective unconscious. 

The lights came on and I stopped, shielding my eyes from the sudden
brilliance. Confusion and surprise swept over me, as this sequence had
never, ever, changed all the times I'd been here before.

"He's waiting for you. Through the door at the end of the corridor."

I turned. It was the blonde woman in the pale grey dress. She was
standing by the bar, smiling, toying with the cherry from a half-empty
martini glass. There was an Asiatic-looking barman behind the counter,
replenishing the supply of bottled mixers from a crate. Beyond him I
could see several staff cleaning tables that stood in a semi-circle
around the dance floor. The slight sense of unreality you usually get in
a dream was noticeably absent; this was pixel-perfect clarity, complete
with the background smell of stale cigarette smoke and last nights
sweat.

"Thanks. This way?"

She nodded and I began walking, feeling almost like an bit-part actor
with a walk-on role. A speaking role, but one limited to banalities. The
carpet felt slightly tacky beneath my shoes and the whole establishment,
obviously a seedy nightclub, made my skin itch. The door at the end of
the corridor was all quilted red leather and brass studs, which matched
the over-all feel of a low-rent dive, firmly mired in the 1970's. The
bouncer on the door, wearing a car coat and roll-neck sweater, nodded as
I approached and stood to the side. The door opened. I stepped through.
It closed behind me.

"Hi Donald, glad you could make it. Glass of champagne?"


<p class=drop>It was a large room, all discrete lighting and lava lamps,
with a sunken seating area in the middle. A man sat there, facing me,
sprawling back against the upholstery and saluting my entrance with a
raised champagne glass.

Not Vigo Hanesh.

I let out a sigh of relief and felt some of the tension leave my
shoulders. This man was a stranger to me, but however strange the setup
it was preferable to confronting someone who should be dead. 

My host waved me closer. "Sit, sit, have a drink. I'm sure you're
finding this a bit strange and the alcohol will help, I assure you."

I walked over. The seating area was a series of semi-circular sofas
divided by short flights of steps. The centre was dominated by a
circular Perspex table which surrounded an open fire, the flue being one
of those free-standing burnished copper funnels which extended from the
ceiling. It was like being in the lounge area of a Bond villain's lair.
The only thing missing was an exotically clad hostess, or perhaps a
homicidal butler. 

Three steps down and I sat, lifting the glass waiting for me. I'd
planned on acting cool, maybe even trying for suave, but the champagne
bubbles caught in my nose and I sneezed, snorted, and coughed. 

My host just laughed. "Nice to finally meet you, Donald. I'm Alexander
Neel, but call me Alex."

I set my glass down and blew my nose, using the action to look at Alex
more closely. He was English by the sound of him, but with a slight
oriental cast to his features. Mid-thirties, with straight, slicked-back
dark hair and a wide smile of perfect teeth. The clothes and dentistry
reeked of money, but there was an unmistakable air of violence about him
I found unsettling.

"Ah, well, Alex, this place, I've never seen it quite like
this before."

"This is the..." he paused, as if mentally translating, "...Mariners
Club, in Vladivostok. It catered for Soviet officers, both Red Banner
fleet and merchant marine. A bit down-market, but it suits my tastes."

I shifted in my seat, feeling the glow of what little champagne I'd
managed to swallow. "Look, I associate these surroundings with-"

"Vigo Hanesh?"

"Vigo Hanesh, yes. Did you know him? Did he come here?"

Alex smiled, ignoring the question and draining his glass. "Do you know
the term 'tulpa', Donald? From Tibetan mysticism?"

"What? What are you talking about?"

"I created the person you knew as Vigo Hanesh. Sent him out into
the world, the real world, to do my bidding. Come now, the consummate
mercenary, acting for some shadowy terrorist organisation with a grudge
against the United States? Didn't you find him just a tad stereotypical?
I created him in the same way you make real those mementos of the
imagination."

I felt confused, flustered, as if reality had taken a wrong turn. It was
like listening to a foreign language you understood along with a
real-time translation into English, but the two versions didn't match.

"You made Hanesh? You can't make a person-"

"You pulled up Hollis and Barnes, yes? Same principle, but Hanesh was
always just an idea, an idea in the minds of hundreds. There's a mosque
in Damascus which venerates him, offers up prayers for his well-being.
With that kind of belief to work with it was simple enough to fashion
the real thing." Alex refilled his glass while I sat there, trying to
make sense of his words. "And to answer my own question, Donald, a
'tulpa' is a being or object which is created through willpower,
visualisation, attention and focus, concerted intentionality and ritual.
In other words, it is a materialized thought that has taken physical
form." He raised his glass, "God bless Wikipedia!"

There was a gloating edge to his voice and I needed to say something
that would steer the conversation back to the real world. "But Hanesh, I
killed him for God's sake! That was real enough, believe me."

"Yes, you did. Best thing all round, in the long run. That's the trouble
with these thoughtforms, they take on a life of their own, start acting
independently. Hanesh became obsessed with you, once he realised who was
tracking him, and thought you could fill in some of the blanks, as it
were."

"Fill in the blanks?"

"I had some ex-Soviet contacts create a background for Hanesh, a legend,
as it's called, so that intelligence agencies would find out enough
about him to believe he was real. Trouble was, Hanesh believed he was
real as well, and the gaps in his memory bothered him. Well, not gaps
exactly, more a lack of detail. He came up with the idea that you had in
some way stolen these memories, and decided to confront you." Alex
shrugged. "Oops."  

I stared at him, aghast. "Oops? That's all you have to say? I killed him
with a bloody corkscrew, for Christ's sake! I stood and watched him die
on my kitchen floor, so don't you tell me he wasn't real!"

"He was as real as you are, Donald, and that's the problem. Some of us
are able to walk both sides of the fence, to live in the realm of
imagination as fully as the real world. You weren't that strong, but
your subconscious obsession with Hanesh was in danger of bringing him
back, giving him a second chance at life. Now that was potentially
embarrassing for everyone concerned, so I decided to remove you from the
equation."

The room suddenly felt really cold. "Remove me from the...You were
behind the explosion?"

He raised his hands in mock surrender "Mea culpa! But you're still here.
A survivor, or more accurately, <i>the</i> survivor. I should have
guessed that would happen, Hell, you even look a bit like Robert Powell,
now I see you close up. Even the memory of Hanesh tried to save you, by
alerting the authorities. God knows why." I struggled for a reply as he
looked at his watch, a Rolex, of course. "And our time together is about
up. I'm not sure what you'll do now, but don't try and find me again. It
would definitely be another case of 'oops', understand?"

I blinked.

The cell was crowded; Walker, his two associates, three RCMP filling the
doorway and corridor. Everyone had a firearm trained on me and Walker
tossed an unsealed manila envelope on the cot beside me. I sat up,
bemused, and began to open it.

"I've received the initial forensic report, Kelso, and it makes
interesting reading. They're recovered four bodies at the scene -
Hollis, Barnes, Anderson...and you."

The envelope contained black-and-white glossies of four bodies. There
was little or no burn damage, and my face was clearly recognisable.

It wasn't a survivable explosion.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop> An android named Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt>
once escaped from his Master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering
about there he came upon a zygon.  Zygons were the most fearsome and
feared beasts in the known universe.  Long and sleek, close furred and
armed with claws and fangs against which naught could stand, the zygon
was fast and cunning, a pure predator that lived only to kill.
<tt>0-CLE5</tt> had seen zygons before, in the Masters' gladiatorial
arena, often pitted against other wild beasts and, worse, eating
disobedient androids alive.

The zygon was lying down moaning and groaning. At first, Android
<tt>0-CLE5</tt> turned to flee, but finding that the zygon did not
pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the
zygon put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Android
<tt>0-CLE5</tt> found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing
all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the zygon,
who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt>
like a dog. Then the zygon took Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt> to his cave, and
every day used to bring him meat from which to live. 

But shortly afterwards both Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt> and the zygon were
captured, and the android was sentenced to be thrown to the zygon, after
the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Master of
Masters and all his Departmental Masters came to see the spectacle, and
Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt> was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon
the zygon was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring
towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Android
<tt>0-CLE5</tt> he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and
licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Master of Masters, surprised
at this, summoned Android <tt>0-CLE5</tt> to him, who told him the whole
story. Whereupon the android was pardoned and freed, and the zygon let
loose to his native forest.

[*DESCRIPTION] 

<p class=drop>Agnotious C. Clehrley scowled his way through the station crowds, his
face a topographic map of angry contours. He was well ahead of schedule,
his train wouldn't leave for half an hour yet; longer, if he felt like
spreading some of his foul mood around.

<div class=pullquote>He squinted up at the glare - no way could this day
get any worse.</div>He pushed his cap back, letting the air-con
chill the sweaty tide-mark
for a moment before screwing it down again tightly, dwelling yet again
on the fact that his train would not be taking off this afternoon, that
it would not soar through the skies like the spirit of freedom itself;
that the amber wings sewn, spread, above his cap's plastic brim were
simply the logo of AERAIL TRANSCONT, Inc. and not a proud badge of
achievement. Never to be saluted. Never to be stared at in awe by a six
year-old lad invited to a cockpit to experience a formative moment.
Never to win one of a string of fleeting coital victories from 
air hostesses and breathy passengers alike. He was not a
pilot, he was a driver. No-one would ever call him Captain, apart from
that smart-mouthed, idiot-grinning conductor. Hell, he was more likely
to be called a Brakes Technician for all the control he had over his
route through life.

"Morning, Cap'n!" yapped the smart mouth. Agnotious grunted in return as
his chirpy, blond conductor fell in beside him with wingman-like
precision, smiling cheerfully both left and right. At least the crowds
were parting quicker for the two of them. "Where to today, Aggy? Right
between those rails, right?" The smart mouth laughed easily, as if he
hadn't just reduced another man's whole life to a pair of parallel lines
heading for a vanishing point of utter meaninglessness. Aggy tried not
to bare his grinding teeth.

Down the escalators and out onto the sunlit platform, the heat hit him
like a slap. Tender skin began to prickle immediately and now Aggy
started sweating properly. He'd be in the shade soon enough though.
Eight straight hours in his seat to look forward to, wet cooling in the
crack of his pants as a chill straight from the Antarctic dryly
circulated "for his comfort", and so he wouldn't fall asleep at the
wheel - at the dead man's switch rather. He squinted up at the glare -
no way could this day get any worse.

"Brothers, sisters," called the voice. Ah nuts, thought Aggy.
Here we go. 

The prophet wore his long hair in a tan-blonde ponytail, with a light
beard attractively dusting his softly angular jaw line. His warm brown
eyes looked with friendly intensity from face to face. He smiled with
knowing sympathy at those whose gazes flinched nervously from his as
quickly as they had alighted, or nodded with assumed camaraderie to
those braver souls, even hostile ones like Aggy, who didn't look away.
He was pleasing to look at, but in a vague sort of way and as always
Aggy couldn't be totally sure that it was the same guy as the day
before. Damn well kept coming back though, that was for sure.

"Brothers, sisters, I have words your hearts would hear. Pause a moment,
if you may, for I will not take long and your train will not be leaving
soon."

"Is, is that what passes for prophetic wisdom these days?" said Aggy,
catching himself half by surprise. His conductor drew a nervous breath.
Aggy's flagrant disregard for Aerail's "Sunshine" policy always put him
on edge, and it wasn't as if he could even tell the guy off for it -
<I>Unhappy Employees Make Unhappy Travellers</I>, as they had both
recited in the past, and Aggy was his driver after all, bad natured or
not.

"Oh, come on, Cap," he said, extra brightly, "He's doing no harm, I'm
sure." Aggy let out a derisive grunt, but it was the prophet who spoke
first.

"No, brother Tom, the Captain speaks well. Can there be a more needless
activity than to fill thin air with empty words, unless it is to
deliberately spread falsehoods in the name of truth? The burden is mine
to be proven right and I eagerly accept the doubt of others, no matter
how heavy that load becomes - for when the rightness of my vision comes
to pass, the transformation of doubts into certainties will lift me like
a feather on the summer winds!" 

He ended this speech with his arms spread as wide as his beatific smile,
and the three men now stood at the centre of a loose knot of observers,
those on the outskirts peering to see what was happening. Aggy stared at
the prophet in surprise, then turned to the smart mouth. "Is your name
really Tom?" he asked.

"Yes it is, thank you," said Tom, hurt. They had only been paired
together for approaching two years.

"I expect it will take more than one good guess to convince you though,
won't it... Agnotious?" The prophet grinned.

"You could have got that from company records," Aggy scoffed, "anyone
could."

"And it was not prophesy in any case," agreed the prophet. "Perhaps
something..." His eyes fell closed and he stood for a moment in silent
contemplation. The audience shuffled and murmured but Aggy kept his eyes
firmly on target - not to spot some sleight of hand but because he
didn't want to find anyone's amusement directed his way, smirking at his
expense. The smart mouth... <I>Tom</I> was still flanking him. 

"Let's go, that train won't drive itself," Aggy muttered finally,
contrary to his own opinion; but at that moment, as if he had been
waiting for that very cue, the prophet spoke. 

<p class=drop>Somewhere else, five banks of ten monitors bathed their
operators' faces
in a blue-green glow. They spoke into headsets, eyes occasionally
flicking up to scan the huge wall screen opposite, which was divided into
continental categories, each one filled with scrolling texts, constantly
being replaced or updated. 

The operator in row-three-booth-eight had been an unemployable Applied
Physics graduate for three years before landing on her feet here. Above
the many windows filled with scrolling text on her monitor (and the one
featuring Agnotious's company record and employee photo) was the word
"Philadelphia".

"The Phillies have signed promising rookie pitcher Jamie Jenkins of the
Orioles for a record seventy-five, seven-five, million dollars," she
read, then glanced at the main screen to check breaking global events.
"A third aftershock in Japan, minor, no casualties." Back to her
monitor. "Business: shares in Jacobson International Plastics rise 26
cents..." 

<p class=drop>"...And the earth will rise and fall again in a distant land," the young
man continued. Some of the crowd had drifted but Aggy and Tom were still
amongst the listeners. Tom was fidgeting now; it was a long walk to the
engine up at the distant end of the platform and they were going to be
actually late if they wasted much more time, but Aggy felt obligated to
listen, even against his will. The prophet opened his eyes suddenly and
looked at him. Aggy flinched.

"Do you invest, Captain?" he asked. "A quarter of Jacob's sons will rise
as well. That's Jay Eye Pee," he added with a wink. The young man bowed
his head for a moment and when he looked up he also held out a soft,
colourful, hand-woven bag for donations. Aggy snorted, the spell broken.

"You're not getting my change for your old wiffle-waffle," he said,
tugging Tom's sleeve as he started away. The train shone in the sun, a
silver thread that would snake across the nation - just legally below
the speed of sound - and be back before sunset, barring further delays. 

"That's okay, Aggy," the prophet said to his back, a smile on his lips.
"There's always another day, and change is, you know, inevitable." Aggy
snorted again and didn't turn. Tom dropped a few small coins into the
prophet's bag, hoping the faint noise went unnoticed by Aggy, then
hurried after him.

"Oh, and wear a coat tomorrow," the cheerful voice added. "It's going to
rain." 

<p class=drop>Thirty-six hours on the road, sort of, it ought to be good
to be home, even if home was a twenty square metre box on the thirtieth
floor. Aggy tossed his jacket over the chair back and went for a shower
while the cooker rayed his dinner. There was more steam in his
kitchenette than the bathroom cubicle when he emerged, clouding out of
the tray slot like dry-ice at a nightclub. Have to get that fixed, he
thought, again, gingerly pulling the meal out with a towel to save his
fingertips.

He sat and flicked channels on the bedsitting-room wall for twenty
minutes as his food cooled, but there was nothing on. Eventually he came
to the news band, channel after channel of waving flags and action movie
anthems: boring, boring, bland-business-news-boring. Resigned, he gave
up, peeling the tray and waving away another little cloud of steam. On
the wall two clones in grey suits with grey hair and grey skin were
telling the underwear model anchorman how good things looked for the
economy.

Aggy chewed his Chick-In-Pie&trade; and tuned out, staring through the
ticker-tape scrolling over the bottom of the screen. GOL, GRD, GWW, HAN,
HAR, HEC, ISL... then he paused, eyes tracking right to left until the
legend<B> </B>JIP 142.03 +.26<B> </B>vanished into the corner of the
room behind his Plas-Authen-Tic&trade; cactus.

There was a clap of thunder outside his single opaque window, then it
flickered at the flash of lightning. "Huh," said Aggy absently, as the
downpour began. Ten channels over, at the start of the weather band, a
Miss World runner-up was forecasting sun with absolute smiling
certainty. <h2>***</h2><I>

<p class=drop>"We're on a three minute count to air, three minutes,
count-and-mark -" Beep. </I>

The message sounded from speakers in every part of the building except
the one that mattered. Two men hurried towards that very room, one with
fluttery little bird steps, the other with the charismatic stride of a
person secure in his absolute importance. Other corridor users deferred
reverentially.

"How's the line-up?" A rich voice, comforting, trustworthy.
Award-winning. 

"A great line up, just great, Greg, just great -"

"I'm not so sure, it felt stale this morning and only the time has
changed. Give me the rundown."

"Okay, Greg, of course. Okay: starting with headlines, ad-break, then
leading with the Presidential Response, expert commentary from Michael
Haiyuns, ad-break, second tier starts with Japan -"

"Again? That's the third on the trot, there'll be nothing left of it
this time next week. It's getting old, shuffle it to the bottom - but
keep an ear out in case it sinks completely, <I>that</I> we'll go live
with. Next?"

"The Rev. John James Faraway shouting down the hellfire about the
conflict with -"

"No, no, no no no. He's becoming a clich&eacute;, this is no good. And
after that?"

"Economic super-boom is forecast for -"

"Hold it." 

The two men stopped in the corridor - rather, the tall one stopped,
thinking, and the other danced back and forth beside him, torn between a
crucial spiralling lack of time and utter subservience to his master.
<I>

"Counting two minutes to air, two minutes, count-and-mark -" Beep.
</I>

<div class=pullquote>"Good evening," said the most handsome and powerful
man in the building.</div>"Hold it. Wasn't there something on the
backup about someone, someone
talking, a street preacher or something?" He frowned, staring into the
middle distance. For a moment his aide marvelled at the same crafted
lines which presented the dazzling illusion of interested focus,
regardless of what an interviewee might be saying at that moment - then
he snapped to it, tapping at his palm board, searching the entire
mediabase for details of the story. Then he scurried to catch up as his
boss strode ahead again.

The lift doors at the head of the corridor glided open for them. The
taller, elegant man checked out his various reflections in the mirrored
doors and walls as they descended. The palm board chirped.

"Okay, I got it: three weeks ago, some guy shows up in Baltimore
spouting what are described as <I>perfectly</I> accurate predictions on
all sorts of topics: local and international news, politics, financial,
the weather, you name it - and, it looks like he's moving around the
country, we've got mentions of the same from New York, L.A.,
<I>Boulder</I>, Philly... lots more - he's a rover."

"Same guy?" Now there was a hint of that smile, that heart stopping
charisma.

"Good looking, pony-tail, ah... hippy-ish outfit. I guess so." 

"Right, bump the earthquake coverage to backup and let's take this as a
surprise second tier between the Pres and the Rev, call it <I>The Only
Man Who Knows The Score</I>, watch the networks scramble, eh?"

"It'll be great, Greg, fantastic!"
<I>

"Counting one minute to air, sir, that's just one minute to air, are you
-" Beep "- on your way, sir?" </I>

"Get that running order to the dee's box now, move it move it." He
slipped a sliver of plastic from his flawless suit jacket, flicking it
open with the coolest of flicks. "<I>To</I>, <I>Dan</I>. Don't worry
about me, you just make sure things are go at your end, okay? New
schedule coming to you and you'd better move it move it, I'll need
something to read straight after the first ad break. Earn your bucks,
buddy. <I>Send</I>." He coolly flicked it closed and slipped it away
again, watching his gofer hop off down the corridor. Past <I>the</I>
door. <I>

His</I> door. He opened it. <I>His</I> studio. This psychic thing could
be good. <I>His</I> crew. It was human, far more so than the usual
personality crap, it could run. <I>His</I> desk. He sat behind it and
blanked his mind. 

<P class=drop>"Count for twenty." Up in the box, Dan the studio director glanced
around at his team and saw everyone in place. At the monitors, all
angles covered. Through the window and down at the desk, and there he
was, settling into his seat and ready to go. A door opened and the gofer
entered, twitching, holding out his board urgently. Dan waved him to a
seat and held up five fingers.

"Count for ten, sync music, sync vid, prep anchor, up fade and play all
for five... four... silent..." <I>and</I>... <I>smile</I>... God, he
thought. The man's like a machine. It's beautiful.

"Good evening," said the most handsome and powerful man in the building.
"I'm Greg Torrent and this, is <I>Channel Pi News</I>."


<h3>Nine Months Later</h3>


<p class=drop>The data centre had grown. An indoor ziggurat beneath four giant sloping
wall screens, each face held ten rising ranks of monitors like the steps
of a pyramid, twenty on each bottom row, eleven on the top, over six
hundred in total. Audio baffles muted the chatter of neighbouring
operators from each other, though the regional supervisors sitting in
the small lounge on the top of the pile could stream any one operator's
voice on demand. Mostly they didn't, just keeping one eye on the
auto-transcripts updating on their lap boards and another on their
respective donation logs.

"They're generous in Australia today," said Oceania, for whom Applied
Physics was now just a hobby.

"Good for you," grunted Americas. "There's too much competition for
quarters in North, what with all the homeless, the unemployed, and the
<I>church</I>. And in South, well, no-one's got anything."

"Which is exactly why you guys consistently get the most positive
feedback. Put a sock in it."

Americas grinned. "Yeah, I know." He held out a hand and Africa
high-fived it. They all looked up at a sudden chime followed by a low
humming, then a section of floor in the corner of the lounge rose into
the air, opening onto a small elevator. A familiar face emerged and
smiled at everyone.

"Hey hey, look who it is!" called Americas. "Let me get you a drink. Oh,
and... how are the prophets?"

"I was just about to ask you the same thing!" quipped the prophet, and
as had become ritual the others chimed in with a laugh. They all got to
their feet and shook hands in turn. "Seriously, how's tricks?" the
prophet asked.

Europe dropped back onto his beanbag and tapped at his lap board.
"Looking pretty good, to be honest. Since the last quarter we've been
seeing a steady increase across the board - even in the US, not that
<I>he'll</I> admit it. If it keeps on like this, by the end of the
financial year we'll be up to our neck in pocket money. Unless you
wanted to expand again, of course."

"That's the plan. In fact, that's why I'm here. We're about to double -
we've just finished construction on a second data centre, in Kyoto. It's
going to handle Asia exclusively. We're going to need experienced brains
to get it up and running... from the looks on your faces, I'm guessing
someone kept her secret."

"You complete bitch!" cried Oceania, throwing a cushion at Asia, who
batted it away with her lap board, giggling. "I knew it, I just knew
it!"

"Great - we're always looking for someone
with a talent for premonition.
We were thinking, how do you two feel about co-heading the new team?"
The prophet winced, then turned to the others and tried to make himself
heard over the chorus of delighted squealing. "As for you guys, no big
move I'm afraid. But this centre becomes dedicated to all the other
regions and we'll be doubling staff in the field. So, you go to senior
supervisors and see about sourcing some new guys from down there on the
slopes, okay?"

"You got it, your holiness." Americas wore a sly, appraising smile.
"That's the line now, did you hear?" 

The prophet sighed theatrically. "Yes, I did, but that was always going
to be on the cards. It's just a case of waiting and seeing who's the
lucky winner." He shrugged, then separated Asia and Oceania and slung
one arm each around their shoulders for a hug. "Come on. Let's have that
drink you mentioned." <h2>***</h2>

<p class=drop>Greg Torrent fixed his audience with a gigawatt gaze and nodded tersely.
"Welcome back with <I>Channel Pi</I> and, news today of, growing concern
about the, self-professed prophet sighted, touring the nation.
Unconfirmed reports have also surfaced placing him in, Mexico,
Argentina, several of the former Brazilian city states and - although I
repeat this is, not confirmed - in the New Russia. Here with me we have,
Michael Haiyuns of the <I>Dog-Watch-Dog</I> watchdog association and,
Reverend J. J. Faraway, charismatic preacher and of course spokesperson
for the <I>Church of the Intra-Faithual Coalescence</I>. But first we go
live to, Hammond Strichter on the scene of the, alleged seer's most
recent sighting. Hamm?"

<i>"Thanks Greg, I'm here at the -"</i>

Torrent mentally muted him and stepped on the quick-cut pedal, silencing
his live mic and opening a line to the director's box while
simultaneously activating a CG loop of himself nodding seriously in case
of unexpected cutaways - the same image which mouthpieced <I>Channel
Pi</I>'s various 24 hour-a-day automated newscasts. "Are they both in
place, Dan?" <I>

"Sure thing, Greg, they're in the green booths and ready to go."
</I>

"They'd better have something poisonous to say. I don't like this story,
Dan. You know why." <I>

"It's a blip, Greg, just a blip, nothing more, nothing to worry about,
just a blip, seriously, don't get yourself worked up, it's only a blip
-" </I>

"If you don't stop reassuring me, Dan, you're going to find yourself on
the fucking street and you can go talk to this asshole direct and ask
him what the deal is stealing my god-damned wind." Dan shut up, but Greg
continued brooding, oblivious to Strichter's inane babbling in the
background.

<div class=pullquote>The prophet gave a benign smile and Greg felt
himself bristling.</div>Ratings had
dropped. Greg's ratings had never dropped, not one point
since he took over as anchor, not beyond a plus-minus point-oh-five
percent fluctuation that could easily be blamed on technical outages.
They had always risen. They only hit a plateau when the researcher
department announced there were no more households in the civilised
world lacking a web feed, and with <I>Channel Pi</I> effectively the
default information provider for the globe, everyone else in the
industry had to scramble to repeat whatever Greg said was the news. 

Yet now, a drop. A consistent drop, for over three months... approaching
one whole percent. Not just on the artificial feeds, but even a drop in
Greg's personal rating. Amongst the world's mere broadcasters, tethered
to their pathetic national and regional concerns, it was worse -
staggering plummets, tens of percents, all over.

All because of that damn-

<i>"Greg! Greg!"</i> Dan's voice broke though and he blinked. <I>"Wake
up! Look
at the feed! Strichter!"</I> Greg turned to his sub-desk monitor, where
a shaking camera POV showed Strichter's meticulously coiffed nape
jostling its way through a tightly packed crowd. And at their centre, a
glimpse of - <I>Him</I>. 

<p class=drop>"I can see him, he's talking!" Strichter's mic was buffeting against the
bodies of the crowd with a mix of annoying unprofessionalism and
pleasing authenticity, the excitement in his voice much the same. "I'm
almost at the front now - excuse me, <I>Channel Pi</I> - coming through
- shift it!" Strichter broke into a circle of emptiness surrounding the
prophet, who paused to look at him with what appeared to be an air of
pleasant surprise. The crowd closed ranks and the cameraman failed to
join him, having to settle for aiming his lens between their heads as
best he could.

"Hello, Hammond," said the prophet. "How is Greg?"

"I'm Ham- Hammond Strichter of <I>Channel Pi</I> news," Strichter barked
redundantly. In the studio, Greg scowled. "How do you answer charges
today that you are
endangering the lives of ordinary decent citizens with baseless claims
for some kind of religiously fundamentalist, er, predictionalism, while
extorting money that their desperate families need to support themselves
in these times of financial instability?" Greg brightened. Maybe the man
had a future as a reporter after all. If they worked on his vocabulary.

The prophet gave a benign smile and Greg felt himself bristling.
"Hammond, I only ask for voluntary donations in return for the service I
provide and, well, if you'll pardon the pun, it's all done strictly
non-profit. As for your kind implication regarding my deep
spirituality... I make no claims of divinity. I simply tell it like it
is, and I think my record for accuracy is spotless. Ask anyone here, I'm
sure they will agree."

There was an outrageous murmur of confirmation from all around; then
worse, laughter, as the prophet added, "In fact, I predict that Mr.
Torrent will have something to say about all this any second now!" 

<p class=drop>Greg stamped on the other pedal under his desk, the feed overrider,
force cutting back to himself. "Thanks Hammond. We're back now with Mr.
Haiyuns and Rev. Faraway, gentlemen, welcome." He stamped on the
quick-cut peddle again just long enough to bark, "I'm out of here, Dan!"

Up in the box Dan and his crew scrambled to connect the appropriate
feeds, materialising the guests from their booths into the virtual
studio opposite Greg's desk. "Thank <I>you</I>, Greg," they chorused. 

"Michael, let me start with you. This prophet: dangerous lunatic or
unstable victim of his own delusions?" Greg leapt out of his chair
without waiting for the answer and stormed from the studio, leaving his
CG persona to deliver the other questions from the script. Neither of
his guests, nor his gradually dwindling share of a shamefully disloyal
audience, had the slightest idea he was gone.

<h3>Four Months Later</h3>


<p class=drop>The two men settled into their seats with a shared sigh. It had been a
long day and the lights in the room were comfortably low, leaving both
men barely more than silhouettes. "So, how was your trip?"

"Nice. It's a pretty country, you know, when you can get past all the
problems. I think we can help make a real difference. Anyway, how are
things looking contribution wise?" 

The other waved at the wall beside them and a small screen came to life,
streams of text and numbers washing up and down it. "Incoming, better
than good. The average donation is rising every day. People everywhere
like this interaction, the personal quality, and they are happy to pay
for it. The fact that we aren't scheduling their information for them or
pushing some agenda seems to make all the difference. Not dropping a
story because it makes bad copy or doesn't meet some vague criteria of
entertainment value. And there's no adverts, of course. Plus at our
current rate of recruitment we'll have to start up a third data centre
before next summer; but we can already afford to do so without impacting
our other operations. The profits, as they say, speak for themselves." 

"We really need to get a new head of comedy around here. And the
Outgoing?"

"Well, good and less good. Anonymously, we're now outspending two-thirds
of the world's states on education, and in the last week alone we've
started supporting eight new junior schools and four more adult
education centres. Unfortunately, the reason for <I>that</I> is the move
towards accredited donations. We're only testing the waters so far, but
we've lost a few schools putting a name to the wallet. People are happy
to take mystery money, but when these boards are actually facing someone
across the table they want to know what axe you're grinding."

"We aren't grinding anything. Except unbiased education."

"Say that, they get more edgy than if you start praying at them. And the
church-sponsor representatives, they hate it! With no strings-attached
cash, we're threatening their charitable stranglehold. So, they do
everything they can to sow seeds of doubt amongst the decision makers,
asking what do we <I>really</I> want, etc. And they aren't above making
direct threats too, loss of Holy favours, scare them into line."

"So, no change there then."

"If it's worked for centuries..."

"You make it work for you too. Pity we have to go down this path, but
sometimes it's true: you do have to give the audience what they want, at
least until they don't want it any more."

"Yeah, well. Only that one thing left to get the snowball really
rolling, but I guess we know now. It's going to be in America. You owe
me a few bucks, pal. Do you know who you want to handle it?"

"Actually, I thought I'd do it myself. I don't think I'd feel
comfortable giving it to anyone else. Besides, I've got a small head,
and every little helps. Who knows..." They stood up and embraced.

"Good luck."
<h2>***</h2>

<p class=drop>"G<i>reg, it's just a - an honour to speak to you!"</i>

Greg relaxed into the world's most expensive chair and smiled
generously. The walls of his suite were blank. He spoke into his own
phone for that intimate touch.

"Thanks, Hamm, really - and I just want to say it, I think you've got a
great future ahead of you." <I>

"Oh - I don't - thanks!"
</I>

"Yeah... if."

<i>"If?"</i>

Greg didn't reply straight away and could almost hear the cold sweat
forming on the other end of the line. "Hamm, we've got a real problem
with this guy, you know? <I>Him</I>. There are reports, not just in the
US, but all over now - he's spinning his webs and people are getting
caught up in them, you know?" <I>

"Whoa. That's... that's, like..." </I>

"Bad, Hamm."
<I>

"Yeah. Bad."
</I>

"I need to know that you're the man to handle this story, Hamm."
<I>

"I am, Greg, I promise! I've got it covered every way!"
</I>

"I know you have, Hamm. But listen: as a reporter, and when the time
comes, as an <I>anchor</I>, it's important to know when to report the
news, and when to <I>make</I> it." <I>

"...an anchor?"
</I>

"Sometimes, reporting the news is about saving lives, Hamm."
<I>

"Yeah!" </I>

"And sometimes, saving lives means making a real sacrifice. If you know
what I mean." <I>

"I... I do, Greg."
</I>

"Have you ever been to war, Hamm?"
<I>

"No."
</I>

"Well then. All I can say is, when you get that chance, for an
exclusive, one off, <I>final</I> interview - Hamm? <I>Make me proud</I>.
Goodbye, son." Greg hung up and awarded himself a private Pulitzer for
Best Anchor. <h2>***</h2>

"It's been three days since the stunning, alleged murder of the,
so-called prophet by former <I>Channel Pi</I> news reporter, Hammond
Strichter. Later we'll be going to the <I>Bush Secure Psychiatric Prison
Facility</I> for a, live interview with Strichter himself prior to his,
key evaluation at the end of the week - and we'll be speaking with the
good Reverend John James about, the support he hopes to lend to
Strichter's cause."

"Back after, these messages." Greg smiled perfectly. Ratings had soared.
He listened to Dan's quiet chatter in his ear, running an eye over the
text on his backup prompt while he waited for the break to end - then
Dan paused. Then he said something Greg couldn't make out. His voice
sounded... bad. <I>

"Greg, we've got to come back on right now."
</I>

"Dan, this is the ad break. We don't interrupt the ad break."

<i>"We're going live in five, text on the prompt. Look fucking serious,
man."</i>

Greg didn't have to. Interrupting the advert break? The sponsors would
kill them all, starting with their children. "We interrupt these
messages - these extremely important messages," he ad-libbed, "to go
live to... to where..." Greg read it again. "To, to go live-" Dan cut
him off mid-word, but Greg didn't even notice, just turned immediately
to his monitor to watch. It was Angela Voney. 

<p class=drop>She had to shout to be heard. "I'm Angela Voney reporting, live at the
scene of the, death of the man they were calling, The Prophet Of
Washington where this, massive, crowd have gathered to witness, the
impossible. Because here, not two minutes ago - wait - wait..." Behind
her tall, blonde bouffant hairdo the crowd was quietening. The camera's
POV rose, lifted to look out over their heads - then, from the centre,
like an expanding ripple on the surface of a pond, the people began to
sit, right there in the street, spreading towards the outer edge,
closer, closer, until the only other person still standing was - <I>the
prophet</I>.

Silence. Then he turned once on the spot, slowly, to look out at them
all.

"The rumours," he said, "of my death are, as they say, not really
newsworthy." Just for a moment, he seemed to look straight into the
camera. Then he waved. "So let me tell you something that is." He
smiled, brilliantly, then began to spread some good news. 
<p class=drop>Back in his studio, a line of saliva leaked from Greg Torrent's slack
mouth onto his tie, unnoticed by all.     
           
<h3>One Month Later</h3>

<p class=drop>The prophet led the newbie - subscriber, pre-convert, whatever - it
would please the press no end if we called them <I>initiates</I>, he
thought - into the spacious lounge, pointing out various features in
passing, watching amused from the corner of his eye as the youngster
stared at some other prophets, relaxing and chatting and staring
peacefully out through the floor-to-ceiling window wall at the mountains
and trees, or the animals grazing by the waterfall lake.

"Nice, isn't it?" he asked. His voice was deep, with just the hint of an
accent.

"They all look like you," the newbie replied. "I mean, sure, you're
black, and some of them are - he's Japanese, look, that one - but you
all look alike. I mean, I never really believed..."

<div class=pullquote>"We'll both dress up Oriental and go check out the
fount of civilisation..."</div>"In the much fabled
<I>Conversion</I>? That's
where we're going now,"
said the prophet. He grinned at the newbie's suddenly wide-eyed
expression and stopped walking. "Don't worry, kid, it doesn't hurt. We
only call it that to give the media a shred of truth to hang their
paranoia on. It is a part of the deal - everyone working in the field
has to toe the company line, so to speak - but there's more than a
little leeway; as you noticed yourself, we embrace all nationalities.
Take me: I wasn't always this beautiful, chocolate flavoured god you see
before you; my mother's side were Norwegian originally. I just really
wanted to visit Africa, so that's where they sent me. Properly prepared,
naturally."

"Naturally?"

"Well, maybe not," he admitted with another grin. He indicated the way
and led the newbie out of the lounge and down a clean pale corridor.
"But there's no questioning the freedom. You get to travel, to see the
whole world if you want, and you're helping do good wherever you go.
I've been thinking about a change myself recently. Maybe the exotic far
east. China would be interesting. Ah, here we are." 

Between a coffee machine and a ceramic drinking fountain was what looked
like a tanning bed, hip-high beneath an opaquely glowing white domed
lid. Just waiting for them there, halfway down the corridor - opposite
the door to a unisex toilet. Like it wasn't very important. The newbie
looked further down the way to a junction, nervously. A couple of
prophets crossed it; one of them noticed his nervous stare and gave him
a thumbs up. He looked back to the prophet - his prophet - this one.

"Man, I'm shitting myself a bit." The prophet patted him on the shoulder
sympathetically.

"I know, don't worry. I was too, the first time. <I>My whole identity is
going away, who will I be, oh my god, oh my god!</I> But really, don't
worry. It only takes about fifteen minutes, it's only cosmetic, and it's
entirely reversible. Seriously, I went back and forth for two hours when
I joined up, just to make sure it always got me right. I used to put my
old face back on like clocking off at the end of the day; this is just
the uniform after all. But after a while, you know. Now I only bother if
I'm going on holiday. 

"Look, I'll tell you what: I'm going to be coming out with you while you
find your feet anyway and I'll have to put my old face back on to blend
in. Can't have two of us in one place at the same time. Why don't we
just give you something nice and Apple Pie for now, and when you've got
up to speed with the spiel and everything we'll both dress up Oriental
and go check out the fount of civilisation for a few months - how does
that sound?"

"I don't speak Mandarin."

"<I>W&#335; b&ugrave; xu&eacute; w&uacute; sh&ugrave;</I>," the prophet
deadpanned. "Well, we can decide later. Hop on."

The newbie did, still nervous, looking about at the narrow compartment
as he lay back. The prophet started tapping at the controls. As he
reached up to close the dome the newbie took his arm lightly.

"You okay?" the prophet asked.

"Yeah, yeah, but..." The newbie swallowed, then squared his jaw. "I'm
good. I just wanted to say..." He held out his hand to shake. "The
name's Thomas... Tom." 

Aggy smiled and took his hand. "I know," he said. "I remember."

<h3>13th January 2031<h3> 

<p class=drop>There is a certain weary comfort to a Monday morning here;
despite the horrors in the prefabs and the faintly gamma-positive sleet
pocking the poly roof of my office, I take some solace from the generic,
familiar schlep of the starting week. 

I have been up for three hours already, a nagging occipitalis ache
dragging me neck first from an uneasy sleep on my surplus noncom cot. In
contrast to my usual fractious, broken dreams, my office looks the same
as always - a small pokey appendix epoxied to the back of the main ward.
One small desk, one half-destroyed chair - the seat as hard as
permafrost, one semi-opaque sheet of plastic masquerading as a window,
one extremely modern laptop - my sole luxury - is probably the single
most expensive item in a hundred kilometre radius. There are over a
thousand carbon and partially silicon based entities within effective
sniper fire range that would cheerfully kill me for it, but so far I
think I've kept it a secret. A beautiful distillation of thirty years of
west coast technofetishism, the computer fortunately doesn't look
anything like a computer does here in the technological doldrums of the
Middle East - they still coo over a Macbook in these parts. 

<div class=lpullquote>stories of whitewashed caves, dentist chairs,
chugging Honda generators</div><P>
I have no fixed schedule here, but many
demands on my time. My charges
have the sweet plaintive demands of the truly helpless, raggedy stick
and bone shapes only faintly tenting the rough blankets that are the
only bedclothes available in the chilly main ward of the hospital. As
usual I make a morning tour of the ward, a depressing euphemism for a
shuffling survey of the two small bays that are the full extent of the
hospital. Zalmai is awake - I've never seem him asleep - his sightless
head tracking every small sound I make as I negotiate the defunct
medical clutter he insists on heaping on and around his bed, a pitiful
hedge against further pain.  We found Zalmai about a month ago; he had
crawled over twenty kilometres from the Maheepar Pass to the suburbs of
Jalalabad. I was led to where he lay by one of the filthy
interchangeable urchins who hang around the compound and who know we
will pay a few afgani for information on the latest unfortunates to
stagger out of the western mountains. Zalmai had heard me coming, the
chill winter morning air telegraphed my approach clearly to his
undamaged ears. Mewling pathetically, he had scrabbled backwards,
bloodied palm prints darkening the cracked, dried mud of the grubby no
man's land of the road verge. He looked up at me - his excised,
bloodless, empty sockets somehow a much worse horror than the terrible
battle gore I had seen and treated - they had taken his eyes. 

The Pardis Hospice is a mean, swingeing,
annex shoehorned into the small space that used to optimistically be
called the Jalalabad Hospital main car park. Now a gomied dumping ground
for shrapnel-ruined medical equipment and discarded prosthetics striking
improbable vogues, the park is also home to our three ex-NATO inflatable
medical tents. Transitory structures long past their half-life, the
prefabs are home to that most contemporary of war victim - the organ
thieved. 

We've been here for a little over three months and I've already seen,
treated, consoled, and sometimes watched die, over seventy victims of
the mountain gangs. It's a hard road from Kabul, and all are fair game;
scooter punks who think they know it all, <i>M&eacute;dicins sans
Fronti&egrave;res</i> newbies, economigrants nomading their way to the
Pakistan border and back in tattered annual caravans of privation. The
gangs seem to prize Christian aid workers most of all. Last week, a
shattered Isuzu pickup dumped the legless, not yet lifeless, torso of a
Jesuit priest right at the entrance to the main prefab; he was also
missing his eyes, and as we found out later, both his kidneys and liver.
He died with his eyelids pinned back, never saying a word, his fists
hiding a crushed rosary. The ones that live are harder to bear, so many
stories of whitewashed caves, dentist chairs, chugging Honda generators,
blank, black eyes - and so much pain. Oddly, these surgeons are
curiously attentive to the aseptic technique, only a handful of our
patients ever seem to develop opportunistic post-operative infections,
and, judging purely on surgical finesse, these butchers seem to wield
their antique scalpels with aplomb. 

The ward stirs as more breakfast grumblings join Zalmai's quiet demands
for flatbread and black tea. Several dislodged dressings add to the
night fart miasma with the high sweet smell of putrefaction, and the
splosh-clatter of a bed pan hitting the floor adds to the fun. I
dispense some gloves, filter up and get to work.

<p class=drop>Air quality permitting, I try and hold the group sessions
outside. When the particulate meter settles into a quasi-quiescent
tick-tock metronome, we bundle up the patients into hand-me-down NBC
suits and stretcher/carry/cajole our charges into the ambulance (an
ungainly USMC anti-mine deuce and a half) and head south east to the
poppy fields near the Khyber Pass. Since the mujahideen went synthetic
savvy and the UNODC quashed production with the simple expediency of
tactical nukes, the endless opium plantations have been abandoned and
gone to seed. The orbital feeds now show a more colourful Afghanistan,
like an ironic mockery of old empire cartography the landscape is a
startling seasonal scarlet against the otherwise unrelenting high
altitude view of the endless browns and greys of the Middle Eastern
prairie. 

<div class=lpullquote>Zalmai wheels, turns, pitches and yaws across the
poppy field</div><P>The poppies hide the other prefab I maintain, a
quiet
place that is
tolerably well preserved by fading UN logos and still functioning outer
skin chameleon polymers. Ignored also, because of its notional salvage
value, the prefab offers us a valuable hiatus space, only occasionally
spoiled by a few empty beer bottles and rank hobo piss. Appearances
aside, I still feel that there is useful work to be done here. We
(mostly me) are one small part of what in quainter (more na&iuml;ve)
times
might have been called a guilty conscience. But it's pointless trying to
anthropomorphise a corporation; the lesson I've learned from fourteen
months in field is that WorkSpace is nothing but deliberate.
Unencumbered by the human flotsam of pity, or empathy, or consideration,
the WorkSpace behemoth moves deliberately and with perfect self-focus.

The Combat Revenue model is a well-worn, well-practiced algorithm that
allows for the faintest expressions of largesse at carefully determined
intervals. The CR tacticians noticed early on in shock and awe
profiteering that they had to allow for a degree of mercy, an
amelioration of <i>take</i>, to maximise their returns. It seems that
even the best-insulated corporate psyche quails eventually in the
one-way bazaar of war.

This is where I  come in -
one small articulation (a feeble prosthetic nod to decency) of the
post-war official WorkSpace Health and Reconciliation programme. Like a
shot in the arm of battlefield stimulant, we had an amazing first year
in Jalalabad - epic funding, baksheesh up the wazoo, access all areas -
even for a Guardian-reading tosser like myself, it was hard to resist
local government-sanctioned largesse... This year's been rather
different. We are no longer the flavour <i>du jour</i>; by October,
WorkSpace PR had already moved onto a free HIV-immunisation programme
for the Cape Town townships, and the scooped torsos and cleanly
delineated stumps of the organ thieved were old news. Funding dropped to
less than ten percent of year one, we lost most of the international
team, the patient suicide rate soared, we moved to the prefabs in the
car park and I lost the one decent camp bed left in southern
Afghanistan. 

We still have the poppy prefab though, and on a spring day with the
early red petals tinting the view, we make some useful progress with our
crippled coterie. Zalmai, in particular, loves the plantation; he knows
that there is nothing to run into, the worst he can expect is a turned
ankle in a rabbit hole. It's become a tradition, as soon as the
ambulance hits the bumpier surface of the gravel road leading to the
prefab, Zalmai grabs my sleeve and turns his eyeless face to mine (a
mute plea I can never resist) and points to the ambo door. I slow the
truck and punch the door release. 

Zalmai hoots and leaps, rolling easily
on his left shoulder, the poppy buds leaving sticky resin on his crappy
jacket and brown dust and early sun forming a glowing corona around his
thrashing form. Then he's up, running, arms outstretched, a child's
aeroplane freedom - a thing of beauty compared to the adult fetishism of
war hardware that Zalmai unconsciously mimics.

The Afgani children that I have met all seem to share an uncanny ability
to imitate the clanks/drones/rumbles/snicks/clicks of the American
armour they have grown up with all their lives. Zalmai wheels, turns,
pitches and yaws across the poppy field filling the air with a pitch
perfect echo of an A12 tankbuster on afterburner, punctuated
occasionally with the bumblebee gargle of the chin chain gun. 

<p class=drop>The activated charcoal in the aircon has long since been
inactive and the prefab   smells like camping trips and the drying
wetsuit tang of childhood seaside visits. I peg back the membrane door
as far as it   can go and we all  shuffle in, Zalmai bringing up the
rear, taxiing reluctantly into the musty space. 

Currently our complement is only seven. A recent <i>c. difficile</i>
outbreak, a spectacular gastrointestinal revolt that left the whole ward
retching and grieving in equal measure, resulted in two deaths. There
was only one surprise, a goat farmer who had wandered into the hospital
compound, unaided, only missing a lung and his left hand. He died four
days later, after the <i>difficile</i> infection swept through the
wards.

Also present are some other stubborn remnants of this year's intake:
Max, a shaggy, denimed member of the ubiquitous tribe of nomadic
westerners that form a grubby, globally-spanning gulf stream of
trust-fund disillusionment and disestablishmentarianism. Six months ago
Max found himself muling out of Kabul with an amphetamine-packed colon
and a nearly valueless solid roll of hyper-inflated Afgani currency. The
Rough Guide is woefully short on hitching advice for the Kabul-Jalalabad
road and Max's abortive attempt to flag down an ancient Peugeot estate
resulted in a third-hand colostomy bag and a free ride to our hospital
car park. Ashur the Syrian, my star pupil, a dead man walking. Ashur was
a DOA at Jalalabad Central hospital, a bloody bundle of rags that had
been cursorily admitted by an exhausted night staff and then rolled on a
broken trolley into an unused corridor in the ER. Doubling as a trauma
surgeon during the first few weeks of my secondment I found this gory
heap as I took five and sucked down my millionth smoke of the night.
Ashur  is what we call a full donor - multiple organ theft and over
fifty percent of limb reduction. Incredibly he was conscious when I
found him, his one remaining hand pawing blindly at the fetid hot air of
the ER. I was new in-country back then and I was gear-rich and drug-fat
from my new WorkSpace coffers. The hospital wing they had assigned me
for the organ theft project was full of box fresh, state-of-the-art kit
designed exactly for the life extension of this type of victim. Ashur
was at the thin end of a survival spectrum probability but back then I
was full of enthusiasm, energy and na&iuml;ve hope.

He made it through the night; his cored torso emptied of offal and
filled with a million euros worth of modular life support. That long
night was a vague memory of grey market Marlboro consumption, the
blinking LEDs of the medical gear and the gurgle/rattle of a jury-rigged
trachea/air filtration unit connection. Ashur is a continuing miracle,
wholly dependent on ageing med gear, scrounged feedstock and smuggled
hormone replacement analogues; yet he has an easy, beatific smile and
always some time for Zalmai. Ashur reminds me of a turn of the century
cyborg wet dream gone wrong. Like a crippled borg lacking the
transcendent scope of Stelarc's vacuum-bound nude explorers, Ashur is
his own street, making his own uses of the tech we can scrape together
for him. 

Gula always brings up the rear, she invariably insists on carrying the
Job from the ambulance to the prefab, an essential piece of kit for the
group sessions. Nearly two metres tall, Gula's single huge right arm
easily flips the modular Job pod off the roof rack and onto its
undercarriage of sprung wheels. Gula has not spoken since she came to
live with us in the prefabs, she has no overt medical needs and I can
only assume she was also a victim of the mountain gangs, the clean stump
of her left humerus betrays the trauma of involuntary surgery, not the
impartial mangled legacy of a farm accident. Gula's huge beautiful green
eyes miss nothing and she acts as our minder during the vulnerable hours
we spend in Job immersion during the counselling sessions. 

<p class=drop>Even with the pharmacological mitigation and enclosure
comfort provided by the Job, therapy with my patients rarely shares the
structured, ethereal
angst of a first world counselling session. Dealing not with the maybe,
the bogeymen of possibility, the faint spectre of disaster - all distant
cousins to true pain; these fragmented souls have already seen and felt
far too much real trauma to compare even fleetingly with my pampered
Albionside client base. After a year of patching up tattered psyches,
gibbering will-o-the-wisp surgery survivors, I have developed an
involuntary rage response when I think back to the work I did at my
Acton practise. When I remember the plaintive middle England whining of
mortgage rate hikes, second job exhaustion, the draconianisms of my own
erstwhile employer, and the dull throb of thwarted careers, the gorge
rises and I frantically pat my pockets for the Marlboros. 

<div class=lpullquote>the rest of the group forms a circle around Zalmai
and me as we interface</div><P>Here in Afghanistan, in this millennial
crucible of conflict, pain is
<i>real</i> and my patients have experienced the full gamut. Not for the
first time I am struck by the depressingly familiar irony of the urgent
consumer strivings of my own cosseted countrymen for
tastes/flavours/newness - bring me a new shirt, a new tie, a... new
thing... anything. Daily I am reminded of the timeless Couplandism -
"purchased experiences don't count"; here, instead, in-country, almost
everyone is looking for a refund of their own bitter, involuntary
transactions. It's a hard lesson too, after a whole life of
absent-minded gratitude for an accident of birth - a genetic dice roll -
it only took a year in Afghanistan to realise that my former life was a
hollow and valueless as a scooped thorax of one of my pillaged charges.

I have a full quiver of therapeutics, though, and fading WorkSpace
funding notwithstanding, I've got good gear. During the prefab sessions,
when we're making a semblance of progress and the tears flow usefully
and cathartically, I feel like I did when I de-planed in Baghdad - a
clean arrow of determination fletched with the belief that I can make a
difference - salve the terrible open wounds of conflict damage.
Technology helps, the long chain polymer perfume of new tech, the
replete power packs, the semi-autonomous repair packs, the vacuum sealed
MREs - though I have painfully and incrementally discovered that all
these hedges against chaos and disorder are merely a delay, a brief
hiatus of intervention that lasts only as long as the new car smell.
After a year of petty theft, pilfering, abrasive desert winds, and the
inevitable over-usage entropy, out of all my original kit only the Job
is running at anywhere near full capacity. 

The Job is a two person therapy model, with empathy bias. Designed in
2030 by a Dutch-Italian WorkSpace subsidiary, therapy Jobs were built
around a central core concept: <i>To feel is to understand</i>. The one
hundred and fifty years of the psychotherapy industry had always been
hobbled by one glaring central limitation - to know someone is not to
know their pain - and without that knowledge there can never been true
understanding, and in turn, succour. The therapy Jobs make the tenuous,
febrile moments of therapeutic insight a concrete reliability. Using the
manipulation of mirror neurone activity - the observationally triggered
physiological process that occurs when conspecific animals (humans
included) witness each other's pain - the Jobs use pharmacological and
electroneurological interventions to augment and enhance the biological
empathy response. This includes the primary nociceptors - the
propagators of noxious stimuli. This means that in Job-facilitated
session the therapist feels the patient's pain. Considered somewhat of a
Wild West field by the old school of non-interventionists counsellors
and therapists, Job therapy is not for the faint-hearted. The pain, both
phantom and real, of (for example) missing limbs, despite being buffered
and baffled by a series of filters controlled by both the therapist and
the patient, could be extreme. Still fringe, and therefore deemed
"deployment-acceptable" in non-first world contexts, the empathy school
was taking some of the first painful steps towards true understanding
and healing. 

Today it's Zalmai's first session, somewhat of a rite of passage in
these de-traditioned times. I ping the Job a wake-up sequence from my
smartphone and it uncurls from its wheeled repose. Carapaced like an
over-plated armadillo, the Job snicks-snucks-clicks into the standard
new patient configuration. Designed to minimise further unnecessary
distress, these Job models lack the sanitary/elimination hook-ups of the
standard corporate Job models, and they also have a much more friendly
on-board AI avatar - gender-variable dependent on the client. Forming
the now standardised defensive outward looking perimeter (a welcome
evolution of session security initiated by Gula), the rest of the group
forms a circle around Zalmai and me as we interface. I lead Zalmai to
the patient saddle, the Job flaring open in a welcoming proboscis
embrace. Seating Zalmai and hooking up the pharma-feed and the skullNet
takes a few minutes, a pause capitalized as usual by at least four of
the group lighting up, I don't really mind - H&S is a distant concept
these days. The Job chirps an environmental particulate/carcinogen alarm
but I squash it immediately - first world puritanism can go fuck itself.

Having made Zalmai comfortable and giving him a few minutes to acquaint
himself with the Job, I then hook myself up in the therapy seat.
Accessing the public landing space I  prep a stylised simulacrum of the
poppy fields outside. In the therapySpace the neurointerface provided by
the Job means that during the sessions Zalmai will see again (a direct
optical nerve hack that anywhere else in the West would be available as
an outpatient procedure), and I want him to have a nice view. The quiet,
small voice of the Job whispers - go - in my ear and the session begins.

<p class=drop>At nearly thirty-seven thousand kilometres above southern
Afghanistan, the geo-stationary WorkSpace relay milsat is a barely
detectable stellar mote in the clear, frigid, night sky. Suspended in a
cylindrical vat of liquid helium, and protected with a ring of bulky
tanks of propellant, the mind of the satellite pulses gently with a
superconductive glow. It doesn't really think; WorkSpace tends to impose
a max AI capacity on geosynchronous weapons platforms with kinetic
missile capability. Nonetheless, the dim, dog-like musings of the sat
envelop its operational output like a primary colour finger painting:
<i>Mmmm, 98% operational efficiency. Recreational uplink in 953 seconds
- woof. Milchcow rendezvous in seven orbits - drool</i>.

The sat has a number of tasks - comms routing, mildata storage, AI
backup - but, primarily, it's a gun. A big gun. Optimised for targeted,
non-radioactive orbital bombardment, the milsat is a fourth-gen geosync
platform built by WorkSpace in 2029 and leased to the US government for
the duration of Afghanistan 2.0. The sat has seen some service, crude
satisfaction routines humming with gratification as the dumb matter
kinetic missiles were deployed at hypersonic speeds from the blunt
muzzles of its EM accelerators. Expelled at speeds close to escape
velocity, the streamlined chunks of depleted plutonium that the sat uses
for ammunition require no explosive payload. Impacting at over twelve
kilometres per second, the dull grey rods of plutonium convey a impact
explosive analog of over 20 kilotons. With no gamma after-effects, the
weapons platform is the tool of choice for the discerning on-the-ground
US military coordinator. They even take it in turns, thrice-PHDed war
technicians squabbling over who gets to pull the trigger on a modified
PlayStation paddle from an invulnerable state-side bunker. 

Latterly, though, the military machine has moved on to oilier
pastures and the milsat has been backburnered to standard comms duties -
piggy-backing commercial TV feeds a dimly perceived jangle of irritating
bits. As the terminator creeps across the terrigenous skeleton of the
mountains of Afghanistan, and the morning brings some welcome relief
from the freezing spring night, the milsat wakes up to a rare but
extremely important ping: get ready to launch. Hard-coded
synapses
shiver alert with an anticipation of pseudo-pleasure - re-deployed it
may be, but the sat is a combat machine - they made it to want to fight.
Milliseconds later targeting data hits its buffer, a priority wrapper
indicates a desired completion timeframe for the action, an imperative
variable tells the sat that the order is reinforced with a WASTE
modifier, somewhere in WorkSpace someone (or probably more likely
somebot) has decided that a WorkSpace initiative has exceeded its
mandated usefulness. In the more litigiously nervous environment of the
developed world this would result in a cease and desist order and fund
withdrawal; out in the Middle East boondocks a more expedient MO is
used: explosive deconstruction and removal. 

The sat processes the targeting data: A geoloc overlay pinpoints the
bombardment coordinates, a more self-aware entity might puzzle over the
rationale and/or military significance of a near-deserted patch of poppy
plantation several kilometres south of Jalalabad, and a less capable
machine might doubt its ability to hit a tiny disused prefab. The milsat
is fully upgraded, though, and has a 94% success termination potential
for targets <0.5 metre square. 250 milliseconds following receipt of
directive its primary EM cannon is unfolding from its dormant
configuration. Fully three seconds thereafter a two metre needle of
ultrahard plutonium is making a ersatz shooting star in the dawn sky of
Afghanistan. Nearly an hour later (an aeon in machine time) the sat's
after-action scan detects a rising cloud of atomised rock and dust
rising into the morning sky. Its sensors are also sensitive enough to
detect in the particulate cloud the fatty-carbon remains of several
mammalian combatants, it also wonders briefly and unconcernedly about
the flash of machine thought coherence it detected just before missile
impact. 

Resource allocation is not one its core competencies, nor does is
possess combat morality algorithms. The sat powers down to dormant, to
again moronically eavesdrop the tsunami of commercial bandwidth flooding
its router.

<p class=drop>"He's in there.  I'll leave you to it then."

I thanked the supervisor.  The door was opened for me by a security
guard, who stood aside discreetly as I entered.  The man was sitting at
a table, looking slightly anxious.  He half rose, smiling uncertainly.
I gestured for him to resume his seat, and lowered my frame into the
chair opposite.

<div class=pullquote>I had inadvertently allowed my jaw to drop
slightly.  "Plodding?" I enquired.</div> "Right," I began, opening my
notepad.  "I'm Investigator Thomas Felling. My name
was on the slip of paper you handed in.  Call me Tom.  And you are...?"

He looked puzzled.  "Mayan armour, ah.  Harmonium, ammonia, uranium..."
He shook his head as if to clear it.  "Nom...  Mormon, Norman."  He
frowned.  "Moon or morgen?"

"It's almost half-past ten.  You say your name is Norman?"

He leaned forward. "Sherry, tomfelling, north shoreman, name dummat.  Horm, neg.  Sorm!  Herm!" 

"So, er... Herm.  Where do you live?"

"Manner of hammering here, Surrey.  Near earshot. Only short arrows.

"Okay," I said, with more conviction than I felt, and tentatively
jotted: 'MALE.  HERM ??  c. 35-40.  LONDON'  "And why exactly did you

He became more animated.  "Seamy, narf!  Crimes!  Sorm, herm.  Wild

abandoned the pen, raising instead an expectant eyebrow.

I had inadvertently allowed my jaw to drop slightly.  "Plodding?" I enquired.

"Plodding."  His somewhat cryptic blurt had now gained a kind of fierce
