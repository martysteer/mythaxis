*Established in 2008 by Gil Williamson,* Mythaxis *has always been focused on the fiction, with as little distraction as possible - no ads, no clutter, just words on the page to transport you somewhere else.*



### STAFF

***Andrew Leon Hudson*** - *Editor*

*Andrew is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing* Mythaxis *he also creates the story art, using of rights-free images provided by too many generous people to mention. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesn't update [his website](https://andrewleonhudson.wordpress.com/) or use [twitter](https://twitter.com/AndLeoHud) very often.*

***N. E. White*** - *Reading Hawk*

*As the originator of* [SFFWorld.com](https://www.sffworld.com/)*'s long-running short fiction anthology series, [N. E. White](https://nilaewhite.wordpress.com/) has read hundreds of short stories with a view to publication. While she's on sabbatical from anthologising, we're happy to have her casting an eagle eye over our anonymised submissions system.* 

***The Slush Canary*** - *Fallen Fowl*

Share a moment's silence for our first slush reader, who has tragically flown on to a better place.

***Marty Steer*** - *Digital Huperson*

Marty is a technical lead in Digital Humanities at the School of Advacned Study. He likes messing about with data and humanities web software engineering crap which intends to upset the establishment at the ridonkulous University of London. He wants minimal computing, loves little rabbits and I also like liminal ideas.
