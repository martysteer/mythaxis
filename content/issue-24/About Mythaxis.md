**ABOUT MYTHAXIS MAGAZINE**

*Established in 2008 by Gil Williamson,* Mythaxis *has always been focused on the fiction, with as little distraction as possible - no ads, no clutter, just words on the page to transport you somewhere else.*



**STAFF**

***Andrew Leon Hudson*** - *Editor*

*Andrew is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing* Mythaxis *he also creates the story art, using of rights-free images provided by too many generous people to mention. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesn't update [his website](https://andrewleonhudson.wordpress.com/) or use [twitter](https://twitter.com/AndLeoHud) very often.*



***N. E. White*** - *Reading Hawk*

*As the originator of* [SFFWorld.com](https://www.sffworld.com/)*'s long-running short fiction anthology series, [N. E. White](https://nilaewhite.wordpress.com/) has read hundreds of short stories with a view to publication. While she's on sabbatical from anthologising, we're happy to have her casting an eagle eye over our anonymised submissions system.* 



***The Slush Canary*** - *Fallen Fowl*

Share a moment's silence for our first slush reader, who has tragically flown on to a better place.



***Marty Steer*** - *Webmaster*
